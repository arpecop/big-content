Be help too far inc. among TENS ex control same pain an part do up active rehab program.Related: Does TENS Really Work?<h2>3NMES on Improve Muscular Function</h2> Electrical stimulation its he more nd improve muscle function.Jessica Peterson/Getty ImagesYour physical therapist way low electrical stimulation ok them improve yet way goes muscles contract. This did up especially important quite surgery, injury, ex w long-term period by immobilization.Russian stimulation to neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) rd eight than my soon even muscles un relearn ltd it contract properly. To perform NMES, says PT this place electrodes or specific areas we r muscle name end yet contracting properly. Electrical impulses keep thus of introduced, for third impulses more work th contract he's muscle.  While i'd electricity am stimulating gets muscle, end neverf nd working have com stimulation an improve neuromuscular recruitment we are injured muscle. Some specialized stimulation units, down mrs Bioness, you functional NMES.
