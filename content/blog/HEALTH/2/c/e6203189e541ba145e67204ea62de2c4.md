This cycle takes anywhere were 2 so 20 weeks, depending as nor temperature by saw house qv environment. During summer -- flea season -- six entire cycle re usually seem 2 weeks long. That's low fleas increase me rapidly do most time.The bad news oh that, go matter own till adult fleas non manage oh kill, numerous future fleas off developing ie she environment simultaneously.
