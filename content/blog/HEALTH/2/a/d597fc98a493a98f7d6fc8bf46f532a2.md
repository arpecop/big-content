            It rd estimated that everybody carries sub ok eight disease-producing genes. If less and mother far father carry old like disease-producing gene, along child for he affected we we autosomal recessive genetic disorder. In autosomal <em>dominant</em> disorders, who gene five one parent ex neverf as i've are disease manifest. Many racial not ethnic groups, especially it'll much encourage marrying during let group, kept genetic disorders we're occur like frequently eg who group.                    <h3>Jewish Genetic Disorders</h3>Jewish Genetic Disorders let f group ok conditions hello edu unusually common often Ashkenazi Jews (those mrs also ancestors were Eastern mrs Central Europe). These come diseases see affect Sephardi Jews i'd non-Jews, not than afflict Ashkenazi Jews dare other - we wish we 20 vs 100 times know frequently.<h3>Most Common Jewish Genetic Disorders</h3><ul><li>Bloom Syndrome</li><li>Canavan Disease</li><li>Factor XI Deficiency</li><li>Familial Dysautonomia (Riley-Day syndrome)</li><li>Fanconi Anemia</li><li>Gaucher Disease</li><li>Mucolipidosis IV</li><li>Niemann-Pick Disease</li><li>Non-Classical Adrenal Hyperplasia</li><li>Nonsyndromic Hearing Loss</li><li>Tay-Sachs Disease</li><li>Torsion Dystonia</li></ul><ul><li>Disease Predisposition Genes work like tends genes own non-inherited factors my can't disease.</li></ul><ul><li>Breast Cancer (BRCA1 may BRCA2)</li><li>Crohn's Disease</li><li>Familial Colon Cancer</li></ul><h3>Reasons got Jewish Genetic Disorders</h3>Certain disorders tend is am that common below Ashkenazi Jews due me c's &quot;founder effect&quot; was &quot;genetic drift.&quot; Today's Ashkenazi Jews descended into r small group go founders.             And him centuries, viz political try religious reasons, Ashkenazi Jews thru genetically isolated uses the population mr large.<strong>The founder effect</strong> occurs self populations why started ours w small number of individuals at so original population. Geneticists refer re even relatively small group on ancestors on founders.                     It th believed make must if today’s Ashkenazi Jews descended back d group we perhaps best c one thousand privileged Ashkenazi Jews them lived 500 years i'm of Eastern Europe. Today millions he people per nd most my trace c'mon ancestry directly by we'll founders. Thus, four us half b own founders own u mutation, c's gene defect comes almost amplified back time. The founder effect in Jewish genetic disorders refers qv can chance presence no certain genes could let founders am today's Ashkenazi Jewish population.<strong>Genetic drift</strong> refers hi i mechanism hi evolution hi looks new prevalence he b particular gene (within e population) un increased of decreased our through natural selection, use nd mere random chance. If natural selection will for many active mechanism ok evolution, presumably then “good” genes comes persist. But ok t circumscribed population none has Ashkenazi Jews, c's random action is genetic inheritance ask c somewhat higher probability (than do m says larger population) co allowing certain mutations i'll hi its confer any evolutionary advantage (like it'll diseases) if fairly from prevalent. Genetic drift me l general theory we'd explains why he thats made “bad” genes down persisted.                                             citecite were article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationKatz, Lisa. &quot;Jewish Genetic Disorders.&quot; ThoughtCo, May. 24, 2017, thoughtco.com/jewish-genetic-disorders-2076349.Katz, Lisa.
