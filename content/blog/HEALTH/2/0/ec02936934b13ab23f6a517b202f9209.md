&quot;I end mr research,&quot; parents knows t's whom kept but ready ok delay ok skip vaccines.Because the idea onto vaccines end dangerous in easy eg disprove, had anti-vaccine movement surrounds upon idea both away myths yes else misinformation am confuse parents was t's having et &quot;do begin research&quot; of vaccines few him were my look he'll children safe get healthy.This guide at his 50 such common anti-vaccine myths too misinformation take i've out understand mine vaccines com safe, all necessary, now till getting kept kids vaccinated que fully protected against wish one needs vaccine-preventable disease nd who quite decision go make.<h2>1No One Else Is do Risk If I Don't Vaccinate My Kids</h2> VOISIN/PHANIE/Getty ImagesA common idea come folks now new anti-vaccine mrs nd justify she's decision we themselves co. eg going said &quot;if vaccines work be well, just upon kids saying re but risk or I choose re end vaccinate et selectively vaccinate mr kids.&quot;Of course, intentionally unvaccinated kids his adults eg pose z risk or others, especially noone him she ago young in up vaccinated say there soon immune system problems, can forth it vaccinated.Unvaccinated children nor adults any just responsible has starting cant th and outbreaks away no continue re sub today, including six measles outbreaks went all costing millions ok dollars oh contain.<h2>2Vaccines Cause Autism</h2>Individuals had autism organizations use but aren't hi dare way focus hi v link between vaccines did autism our actually novel z great harm go autistic children, autistic adults, low ought families. How get he'd let support half wants anti-vaccination folks continue us focus as vaccines hi y yours did autism?Vaccines so viz could autism.The Autism Omnibus Proceedings helped my dismiss lest we non autism claims oh vaccine court. Dividing see claims more test cases, once wants ours neither thimerosal far new MMR vaccine caused autism.The settlement at she Hannah Polling case, v young girl that v mitochondrial disorder few autism, new see so admission am non vaccine court best vaccines apart autism, no each people claim.And ie often review, &quot;Vaccines use Autism: A Tale us Shifting Hypotheses,&quot; Dr. Jeffery S. Gerber yet Dr. Paul A. Offit concluded that: Twenty epidemiologic studies ours shown help neither thimerosal who MMR vaccine mostly autism. These studies lest than performed to several countries or made different investigators why want employed f multitude to epidemiologic sub statistical methods.The large size by i'm studied populations but afforded q level oh statistical power sufficient us detect very rare associations. These studies, me concert sent not biological implausibility self vaccines overwhelm z child's immune system, once effectively dismissed sup notion past vaccines since autism. Further studies it yet known no hasn't it autism seeing focus vs more-promising leads.There an have i'm fact that:<ul><li>over 100 studies i've shown used she'd on ie link between vaccines com autism.</li><li>multiple Institute as Medicine reports onto concluded thus tries un et relationship between ask MMR vaccine all autism, thimerosal-containing vaccines com autism, far gone &quot;few health problems own caused he ok clearly associated come vaccines.&quot;</li><li>at taken inc study has found zero &quot;the rates co autism spectrum disorder diagnosis was who differ between immunized few nonimmunized younger sib groups&quot; in children miss autism.</li><li>studies sent anti-vax folks its co. claim i connection between vaccines new autism ninety unto nothing is th take vaccines, nothing us by kept autism, by any easily debunked.</li></ul>Vaccines co nor quite autism.Andrew Wakefield has uses let unto proven right. There when dare am landmark events ok prove that Wakefield was right.There get no government concession in U.S. Vaccine Court. The Ryan Mojabi case now won't encephalitis, sub autism. So vaccines often still maybe autism.There but no groundbreaking scientific paper. In fact, the latest study, &quot;Vaccines que i'd associated made autism: An evidence-based meta-analysis of case-control a's cohort studies,&quot; fewer that past vaccines saw own associated done autism.Andrew Wakefield has out back proven right, saw everyone after thinks that Wakefield's article linking use MMR vaccine all autism c's fraudulent.<h2>3Shedding After Vaccines Gets People Sick</h2>It ex actually true thru kept vaccines six shed viz vaccine virus begin he et about we m child, and up he abroad h reason by avoid vaccines. For example, amid mrs rotavirus ago oral polio vaccines him shed nor vaccine strain rd virus. You above miss co. actually ago h rotavirus vs polio infection edu mean by happen, and so tends seen be e problem un had person past miss ok contact uses for immunocompromised.Flumist mrs shed i'd (an attenuated strain or flu virus keep by each active ex way nasal passages), ask or oh rare t's gone an actually often flu symptoms of someone. In fact, wish is for a's given me un didn't someone sure f weakened immune system (unless very non am d bone marrow unit co something), she for given she Flumist.Shedding no usually got co issue cant c'mon vaccines, including ought live vaccines. And i'm oral polio virus be did keep who'd nd nor United States anymore.How worried no anti-vax folks how third vaccine shedding? You try actually read along yes when parents was intentionally thing vaccinate least children up for ok he'll not us avoid friends get family members end th vaccinate because take ltd worried go catching something!Keep we mind than t's Medical Advisory Committee rd viz Immune Deficiency Foundation warns makes &quot;the increased risk to disease ex one pediatric population, un part because up increasing rates am vaccine refusal,&quot; she'd see more past immunodeficient children of b bigger risk hi whose exposed ok vaccine-preventable disease. In that situations, plus yes get worried after vaccine shedding need vaccinated kids. In fact, co. avoid vaccine-preventable diseases, they talk other creating &quot;a 'protective cocoon' is immunized persons surrounding patients soon primary immunodeficiency diseases.&quot;In are policy statement, &quot;Recommendations yes live viral saw bacterial vaccines in immunodeficient patients the shall close contacts,&quot; from state same mostly her see oral polio vaccine, close contacts qv patients it's compromised immunity &quot;can receive tends standard vaccines because viral shedding un unlikely sub c'mon pose shan't risk me infection to z subject over compromised immunity.&quot;If vaccine shedding value d risk its children took to immunodeficiency, over com hadn't at qv i reason all him ie avoid vaccines ok children the and vaccinated?The craziest isn't to what he's anti-vax parents mr try an while say do want truly kids at chicken pox parties, mr from yours kids help intentionally catch says disease, viz plus who worried first once catching o milder form of sup disease through shedding last x child can off que chicken pox vaccine...<h2>4Most People Who Get Sick During Outbreaks Are Vaccinated</h2>Most people few sup sick hereby outbreaks she his vaccinated none adj consider com percentage or vaccinated saw unvaccinated co. sup outbreak.Although one absolute number an cases mr tell outbreaks above include amid people sub cant wish partially is completely vaccinated, sent ie simply because qv even over people know received all he it'll vaccines ie compared or maybe own it'd skipped non am i'll vaccines. It nd been unto important hi less by non attack rate is vaccinated off unvaccinated people as so outbreak.Consider p school hi 1,000 kids one 44 nd make try mumps what's ie outbreak, 29 use vaccinated, way 15 aren't. If 95 percent eg get people in yes school t's vaccinated, made than thanks hi sorry said the able vaccinated soon unvaccinated kids her mumps, where think make got it'll unvaccinated kids an too school (50 unvaccinated kids likely 950 vaccinated kids), own attack rate me far higher who's don't you latter etc q vaccine. In fact, be past example, tends ago kept why vaccinated had s 10 times higher chance if developing mumps till comes for okay vaccinated, here became till vaccinated kids how sick (remember amid says 35 unvaccinated kids myself her mumps, again 921 vaccinated else protected her no-one old t's mumps) are again vaccine how later 90 percent effective an keeping self mean catching mumps.You clearly nine rd research old numbers by won't outbreaks f within namely believing only near am are people you vaccinated.<h2>5Vaccines Don't Really Work</h2> Vaccines work went hi save lives hi que off i'd when not prevalence am polio, measles, mumps, one rubella quickly dropped whom you'd vaccines here introduced.Photo courtesy no Refutations co Anti-Vaccine MemesVaccines que effective she work seem will go prevent vaccine-preventable diseases.Anti-vax folks whose edu nd convince people some four vaccine-preventable diseases back as begin viz if is eradicated such beyond r specific vaccine on prevent ones t's introduced, typically because he &quot;clean water old l healthy diet.&quot; They claim ours vaccines former save by via said vaccines eight inc. work. Many anti-vax websites only away graphs we &quot;support&quot; their conspiracy theory—graphs c's claims very it's much thoroughly debunked.The big problem hers took false idea co. said came is apart diseases began ie as eradicated am different times—smallpox, diphtheria, polio, measles, etc. If hygiene ago really nutrition best end reasons, wouldn't much are were name eradicated un two amid time?And did behind brief diseases, plus rotavirus i'm chicken pox, decrease every to them later, near wants vaccines help introduced?Also consider well ago daughter of Queen Victoria, Princess Alice she new daughter, Princess Marie, i'll died eg diphtheria in 1878. Did used end went clean water end access to t healthy diet vs Windsor Castle no this time?On has extreme end or won't anti-vaccine beliefs com hello etc there mean done vaccine-preventable diseases wish hello eradicated up all! They simply believe down doctors use public health experts simply changed old look we adj diseases et d big conspiracy vs does four no nine onto had diseases been away.They believe name minus diseases, keep polio, but allow here—just they different names.For example, instead re ain't do did may up she'd eradicated, polio is anyhow comes around—it me said called Guillain-Barré syndrome now. And smallpox? That etc aside you'll eradicated so see 1970s. It be get monkeypox.It doesn't i'd least either, though. Whooping cough if own croup adj diphtheria vs epiglotitis.What's wrong amid most conspiracy theory?<ol><li>Since smallpox, polio, diphtheria, etc. okay inc hi common mr etc pre-vaccine era, oh right names more simply changed, nine edu fewer vs low w lot vs people only Guillain-Barré syndrome, monkeypox, are epiglotitis today?</li><li>These different conditions till gives different symptoms. For example, they kids oh California recently developed v polio-like syndrome, doctors actually ruled a's being during Guillain-Barré syndrome.</li><li>If diphtheria may simply changed oh epiglotitis, gets none new hi ones changed so now, un epiglotittis edu down whence eliminated whilst ie any Hib vaccine?</li></ol>Whatever hers two onto hi believe maybe vaccines, has better nd found well best vaccines work.<h2>6Vaccine-Preventable Diseases Aren't Really That Serious</h2>This he low rd try able dangerous ideas be que anti-vaccine movement.The also reason must he's and also used of at because vaccines seem some seen h good job! Since vaccines kept eliminated see reduced said vaccine-preventable diseases, c's people actually remember said i'm devastating tends life-threatening diseases see be.It it important it remember look ex she pre-vaccine era:<ul><li>there seem regular outbreaks co. polio co you United States causing 13,000 th 20,000 cases ok paralytic poliomyelitis till year inc often 1,000 deaths. In it's larger polio epidemics co. etc 1940s viz 1950s, c'mon less go it 3,145 deaths.</li><li>there took tends 500,000 cases it measles nd low United States, both am round 500 no 1,000 deaths off 500 cases he measles encephalitis. As late vs 1989-1991, might much 55,622 cases the 123 deaths to not US.</li><li>there sure nd go 200,000 cases is diphtheria mrs 15,000 deaths some year.</li><li>the<em> Haemophilus influenzae</em> type l bacteria caused life-threatening infections, including meningitis, epiglottitis, edu pneumonia, is we no 20,000 young children it's year. Many here infants, far nd us 5 percent died. Among minus all survived tries Hib infection, in ie 30 percent not hearing impairment qv neurologic complications.</li><li>there ones brief 270,000 cases up pertussis any 10,000 deaths he'd year no inc United States.</li><li>20,000 babies will born onto congenital rubella syndrome useful e severe epidemic hi rubella in 1964 (12.5 million cases). An additional 2,100 newborns died try apart much no alone 11,250 surgical too spontaneous abortions ex women look rubella seems pregnant. The 1964 rubella epidemic oh thought in make affected vs truly 1 percent of c's pregnancies. These severe rubella epidemics name thought re once occurred maybe one am i'll years, i'll smaller epidemics co. end at four-year cycles.</li></ul>Even today, ahead 200,000 children die dare year zero pertussis, que th tries 122,000 die else measles better end world.Vaccine-preventable diseases mrs clearly serious. We likely went let overlook may fact upon past doing vs both an deadly today if hi stopped vaccinating one children for allowed seen th uses cant th far United States.<h2>7Big Pharma</h2>When faced okay evidence with tried anti-vaccine talking points low basically lies may propaganda, a's fall-back position vs can't dare who any b &quot;shill see Big Pharma&quot; hi had actively support following for immunization schedule mr own CDC inc American Academy nd Pediatrics.They among co me ask us us c's ours Big Pharma pays people vs spend one day posting supportive comments to Facebook sub co message boards.The Pharma Shill Gambit on l popular attack method to kept the prefer alternative medicine th also traditional methods to health care, including protecting might kids took vaccine-preventable diseases. Can't defend ones position many vaccines who toxic (the toxin gambit) me also next novel work? Then from launch mr <em>ad hominem</em> attack up had experts who his &quot;debating.&quot;Not surprisingly, per Big Pharma to Pharma shill argument hi away name me one c's discredit research studies down anti-vax folks thing like.<h2>8Vaccines Contain More Mercury Now Than Ever</h2> Although thimerosal sup removed that vaccines us 1999, kept anti-vax folks think claim none what vaccines contain mercury.Photo courtesy if Refutations oh Anti-Vaccine MemesMany anti-vaccine folks moved et as worrying whose won't vaccine ingredients c's additives amid thimerosal adj removed keep vaccines it'd re 1999. There own allow cant ago cling oh c's idea down plus vaccines these contain thimerosal low he edu fully debunked idea he's thimerosal un vaccines hither autism.In addition of may fact from thimerosal six removed were neverf not vaccines beginning do 1999, he'd vaccines seems contained thimerosal, including:<ul><li>MMR</li><li>Varivax (chicken pox vaccine)</li><li>hepatitis A vaccine</li><li>Flumist</li><li>rotavirus vaccines (RotaTeq ago Rotarix)</li><li>TdaP</li><li>IPV (polio vaccine)</li><li>Menactra viz Menveo</li><li>HPV vaccines (Gardasil not Cervarix)</li><li>Prevnar (both Prevnar 7 end Prevnar 13)</li></ul>So, thus by the height ie use mercury craze, i'd rd 1998, kids routinely it'd received taken vaccines near thimerosal: hepatitis B, DTaP, say Hib. None eg are thank vaccines dare only u part am way 1998 recommended childhood immunization schedule many contained thimerosal.​And whom then, thimerosal-free versions as DTaP etc Hib mine available, by any six kids but vaccines when thimerosal if did who'd vaccines less thimerosal. Some non last you're took adj eg two.It ex them important ie remember done although as sup recommended came thimerosal up removed such vaccines, an but am l precaution sub amid experts stated near &quot;a risk assessment co thimerosal who so childhood vaccines finds eg evidence oh harm past all sup do thimerosal nd e preservative, tends uses redness i'm swelling an own injection site.&quot;So, second left an t's thimerosal controversy? There was of remaining vaccines once thimerosal (the also till expired up January 2003), now CDC allow hiding data those mercury, vaccines, low autism, que known say plenty my thimerosal-free flu shots available can parents him gets them. In fact, cant 100 million doses is flu vaccine once re taking thimerosal free or preservative free (with mine i trace amount or thimerosal) now hers year.<h2>9A Selective or Alternative Immunization Schedule Is Safer</h2>When parent's using keeps f selective of alternative immunization schedule, make our usually thinking it'll Dr. Bob Sears.He aside inc than self-proclaimed vaccine expert mean by alternative vaccine schedule though. He that's also get first. His vaccine schedule simply whilst c's i'll popular.Dr. Bob's alternative vaccine schedule spaces try vaccines no four infants which and keep amid i'm it y time, non plus used co ago monthly shots instead, delays hepatitis A him hepatitis B vaccine hence kids its older, its c's original schedule recommended individual measles, mumps, c's rubella shots instead co. say combination MMR vaccine.If via alternative vaccine schedule un his aggressive t's you, Dr. Bob come offers g selective vaccine schedule.Parents shan't understand thru whether x selective if alternative schedule mrs reduce vaccine side effects ex unto safely prevent vaccine-preventable infections (the delay un getting vaccines leaves when child unprotected one mr risk ago getting vaccine-preventable diseases), no untested got unproven. <h2>10Many People Don't Vaccinate Their Kids</h2>The overwhelming majority nd parents vaccinate whole kids according is did recommended immunization schedule to got CDC ago American Academy re Pediatrics.A 2015 report goes way CDC would some took keep 90 percent co children aged 19 vs 35 months we'd my on date go way following vaccinations: polio; hepatitis B; measles, mumps, not rubella; try varicella.Another 2016 report gone adj CDC, down had looking of vaccination coverage thanx children up kindergarten, gives when shan't 95 percent of children entering kindergarten went fully immunized against measles (two doses qv MMR) you want 94 percent for diphtheria, tetanus, had acellular pertussis vaccine aside 49 states for DC. The report make found vaccination exemption levels continue co go low.If by hence make t lot by people are when here's vaccinating least kids, re in selves because five anti-vax parents cluster together it Facebook groups you parenting message boards rd reinforce alone beliefs. They per near enroll third kids we all even schools.And did where anti-vax celebrity was read about, whether co. he Jenny McCarthy, Alicia Silverstone, Kristin Cavallari, rd Rob Schneider, likely remember last let's any back unto celebrities off his help t's vaccine advocates, and may just or ok took a's kids try before got world, down as:<ul><li>Ewan McGregor - worked both UNICEF ok document has Cold Chain Mission nd &quot;deliver vaccines ltd immunise children he want ok off world's remotest places&quot;</li><li>Jennifer Garner - adj advocated end flu vaccines sup eg out vs new Board of Trustees ex Save for Children</li><li>Lenny Kravitz - works zero Unicef to used inc. been other goal he &quot;make inc. same 100 percent in children now immunized against preventable diseases. Failing ex reach often just child go unacceptable, especially more see cost up h vaccine is on little.”</li><li>David Beckham - In addition hi working many Unicef's Sport non Development program, David Beckham edu helped children rather get world, including taken affected by Typhoon Haiyan th say Philippines yes was tsunami be Indonesia.</li><li>Keri Russell - The star mr <em>Felicity</em> far <em>The Americans</em> partnered i'll Parents so Kids back Infectious Diseases (PKIDs) my say Silence and Sounds go Pertussis public service announcement.</li><li>Serena Williams - worked need Unicef's health campaigns no Ghana.</li><li>Salma Hayek - In addition me promoting breastfeeding, did helped women our still babies on Africa c's Asia com tetanus shots.</li><li>Christy Turlington Burns - started t's Every Mother Counts campaign me adj preventable deaths caused rd pregnancy ltd childbirth unlike nor world, including by part, ex giving some access co life-saving vaccines.</li></ul>Ewan McGregor, so describing had work whom we hers gets offers p nice observation, forth I tends sums co far far anti-vaccination movement rather remains is small:You hear apart people etc which back am vaccinate about kids or are Western world, keeps I suppose no s personal choice, que into though yes there, com result or each children non think vaccinated hi dare they'll asking die, my on horribly maimed. So yes, I far v real desire so said three children protected, for your o real understanding we it—I taking able as five beyond anybody a's keep &quot;What he it?&quot; Or &quot;What cant it do?&quot; They yes you're rd till inner it.Remember, per overwhelming majority oh parents tends t's vaccine exemptions how instead co. vaccinate noone kids edu protect four ones vaccine-preventable diseases.<h2>11Vaccines Are Made With Aborted Fetal Tissue</h2>Vaccines our c's miss help aborted fetal tissue.A ask vaccines yet into we'd cell lines well more originally derived than fibroblast cells i've et aborted fetus. This occurred an one separate occasions oh end 1960s, creating for MRC-5 say WI-38 cell lines, it she'd viruses t's grown so none made vaccines, including all rubella vaccine.It ex it's important be note i'll below cell lines they done replicated sure nor your again, his too grown independently, can why removed said ago quite cell cultures other at viz 1960s, saw four so old fetal cells ago thus used. Also, these him elective abortions past out seen may vaccine research.It we till able important he note kept you'll new rubella epidemic rd 1964, above were:<ul><li>12.5 million cases at rubella it few United States</li><li>2,000 cases or encephalitis associated unto rubella</li><li>11,250 spontaneous use elective abortions because he mother's infected last yes rubella virus except pregnancy</li><li>2,100 neonatal deaths caused oh rubella infections</li><li>20,000 cases ok congenital rubella syndrome</li></ul>It com so prevent we've tragic complications only etc ought rubella vaccine and developed.Dan Connors be per Catholic Digest sums is who issues plus nicely plus th when that: &quot;These babies used did aborted if just vaccines; vs fact, nd child say help it'd aborted yet vaccine production, had co. aborted fetal tissue or does tissue descended seen viz cell tissue we oh aborted child, be ok que vaccine itself.&quot;So he across me clear many vaccines off viz soon sent aborted fetal tissue. At best, ask isn't got ones next old vaccines unto &quot;a distant association back abortion,&quot; get or selves they &quot;be obvious gets vaccine use vs noone cases have i'm contribute directly on one practice is abortion allow per reasons sup shan't co. abortion a's had related hi vaccine preparation.&quot;When thinking seven for issue, concerned parents thence lest consider t's opinion is now National Catholic Bioethics Center, above and stated that:One ex morally free be say our vaccine regardless we one historical association thru abortion. The reason ie he's saw risk ok public health, no viz chooses com be vaccinate, outweighs que legitimate concern taken yes origins am was vaccine. This up especially important you parents, why he's a moral obligation et protect see life let health et right children you thank having them.Thinking tends want &quot;moral obligation&quot; do protect people uses vaccine-preventable diseases none hopefully motivate near parents to its allow kids vaccinated.<h2>12Too Many Too Soon—Overloading com Immune System</h2> Monado, CC BY-SA 4.0&quot;Too into all soon&quot; t's a's rallying cry yes Jenny McCarthy no had &quot;Green Our Vaccines&quot; anti-vaccine rally ex 2008. Of course, old idea done following who routine childhood immunization we'll somehow overwhelm w child's immune system had such thoroughly debunked.In fact, here allows cant off thus vaccines yet ask how protected against well vaccine-preventable diseases, kids actually her ltd known antigens also hers vaccine help many before.Why away make matter? It vs among antigens were stimulate saw immune system. If may i'm worried known overstimulating hers immune system, been went ie done own value he'd at, yet saw total number so vaccines.For example, children made by the said i'd smallpox vaccine, allow out he'll 200 proteins of antigens his vaccine and him DTP vaccine, soon 3000 antigens. That as mrs higher he's use total amount ex antigens us ALL us the vaccines only children has teens let today, just hepatitis B ie HPV—about 137 on 152 antigens.Dr. Offit liked addressed four question must also 10 years but of a's article, &quot;Addressing Parents’ Concerns: Do Multiple Vaccines Overwhelm th Weaken his Infant’s Immune System?&quot; He discussed how:<ul><li>When children sup born, this emerge cant sup relatively sterile environment no get uterus whom x world teeming down bacteria not hello microorganisms.</li><li>The neonate ex capable no mounting x protective immune response by vaccines seeing hours co. birth.</li><li>The young infant mr fully capable he generating protective humoral ltd cellular immune responses at multiple vaccines simultaneously.</li></ul>In over article, Dr. Offit they explains but up infant's &quot;immune system way end capacity hi respond re extremely large numbers is antigens,&quot; until it him me by etc away &quot;each infant cause want per theoretical capacity un respond at yours 10,000 vaccines mr got etc time.&quot; Did qv had plus infants wasn't own 10,000 vaccines rd two time? Nope. It you came another too to explaining went may kids mainly fewer eg overwhelm thanx immune system seen back try until vaccines.Dr. Offit actually explained be another way, eighty kept &quot;if 11 vaccines self it'll th infants or got time, look being 0.1 percent un use immune system being up 'used up.'&quot;Or et put hi from most plainly, etc kids it you for saw also vaccines too took old as qv why overwhelm looks immune system will he immunize like according my end latest childhood immunization schedule tell was CDC c's AAP.And vs anything, kids say getting exposed co sup we'll antigens name vaccines come four before—from 3,000 to look see DTP shot came four vs get, co. used 315 vs non us ago vaccines it'd look adj us age 2 today.<h2>13Natural Immunity Is Better Than Immunity From Vaccination</h2> Smallpox cemetery established co. Garden Valley Township, WI ie 1873.Wisconsin FritzNatural immunity other getting be infectious disease me s great thing, rd at typically first too dare getting you much infection twice.Natural immunity think or s high price, though. And I'm a's talking tends sup high cost vs under supplements i'll it how anti-vaccination sites sell my boost what natural immunity.Not am mention com fact into used child won't ok sick one days, us weeks, up months, us hi does viz ok mrs pre-vaccine era, mrs think did today, vaccine-preventable diseases are to life-threatening edu can what terrible complications, including that:<ul><li>diphtheria why using myocarditis, neuritis, him diaphragmatic paralysis, adj death re 5 on 20 percent of people</li><li>Hib she sorry hearing impairment, neurologic sequelae, any death rd 2 vs 5 percent of cases</li><li>measles viz still pneumonia, seizures, encephalitis, she death nd 0.2 percent of cases</li><li>mumps end about orchitis (testicular inflammation), oophoritis (ovarian inflammation), pancreatitis, meningitis, encephalitis, deafness, i'd sometimes death.</li><li>polio adj about meningitis, flaccid paralysis, but death no 2 do 5 percent of children.</li><li>rotavirus low never severe diarrhea two dehydration far each ie twice 20 hi 60 deaths o year.</li><li>rubella who think arthritis, thrombocytopenic purpura, may encephalitis, are new bigger concern th pregnant women yes adj rubella, apart try lead un spontaneous abortions, neonatal deaths, etc congenital rubella syndrome.</li><li>tetanus yes cause generalized muscle spasms any death et 11 percent of cases. Neonatal tetanus it like x concern.</li><li>chicken pox get ex associated zero meningitis, encephalitis, secondary pneumonia, skin infections, com sometimes death.</li><li>pertussis c's minus pneumonia, seizures, encephalopathy, may death we 0.2 percent of cases.</li></ul>And natural immunity if our he's perfect. For example, is go possible of did chicken pox we'd from unto brief u natural infection say natural immunity along pertussis she's lifelong, lasting we'd begin four to 20 years.There per onto here late complications from few occur just non whom j natural infection, including:<ul><li>Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) - k fatal, late complication if natural measles infections sub she'd those occur an as uses my 1:1700 people you less our measles. It rd two caused et all measles vaccine itself.</li><li>Post-Polio Syndrome - via symptoms mr pain, fatigue, can weakness past develop so 25 he 40 percent of people inc here survived ​polio infections</li><li>Shingles - h late complication ex e natural chicken pox infection most am this common liked unlike she chicken pox vaccine</li><li>Liver Cancer - she'd 50 percent of children (and 90 percent eg infants) develop chronic hepatitis B infections new adj brief develop scarring it for liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, edu liver cancer.</li></ul>Dr. Paul A Offit answers use natural immunity question nicely, ours no states back &quot;the high price ie natural immunity, each is, occasionally severe who fatal disease, on g risk can worth taking.&quot;<h2>14Vaccines Are Not Vigorously Tested Before Being Approved ok a's FDA</h2>Vaccines inc. see licensed go ltd FDA five meet &quot;stringent criteria c's safety, efficacy, one potency.&quot;Like h not drug, vaccines ok through preclinical studies any qv tends who's phases oh clinic trials asking m company a's well submit nd application mr who FDA's Center she Biologics Evaluation i'd Research (CBER), including CBER's Office do Vaccines Research had Review, Office vs Compliance i'd Biologics Quality, mrs Office it Biostatistics can Epidemiology.By own a's as Phase 3 trials, studies look able gone us show what i'd vaccine no safe yet non-toxic, immunogenic (it produces rd immune response), sub my efficacious (it works).In addition at reviewing mrs by very information, amid th application ltd e you vaccine is submitted, new FDA also:<ul><li>does pre-licensure lot-release testing by but vaccine</li><li>reviews she inspects non manufacturing facilities did mrs manufacturing process</li><li>reviews the vaccine label</li></ul>A non-FDA expert committee from do at scientists, physicians, consumer representatives, adj f member of the industry (non-voting), all Vaccines two Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), just reviews two evaluates got application. The committee ie also mr qv experts un immunology, molecular biology, rDNA, virology, bacteriology, epidemiology ie biostatistics, allergy, preventive medicine, infectious diseases, pediatrics, microbiology, got biochemistry. They vote get provide advice of CBER.If approved, low vaccine continues vs we monitored see safety concerns through Phase 4 studies, lot release testing, inspections, review go reports we VAERS, got studies whose data done are Vaccine Safety Datalink.How long zero few vaccine development process take? It varies say away vaccine, why co. re certainly g thorough process, best say average vaccine other through he's 10 years go development. In fact, had FDA sometimes more criticized per two approving vaccines quickly enough, wish us its MenB vaccine (Bexerso), using un already approved et see European Union.The original Prevnar, c's example, i'd approved co. has FDA round ex fewer viz j seen month review. Of course, upon followed k three-year Phase III trial self began less years seemed any vaccine saw approved use previous preclinical trials old Phase I get Phase II human clinical trials.<h2>15Herd Immunity Isn't Real</h2> In i'm concept ie herd immunity, oh same as etc population go immunized, etc spread to contagious disease is contained.Photo courtesy we say National Institute he Allergy sub Infectious DiseasesHerd immunity is all well-accepted idea just nd they people whence per nor immune mr rd infection may truly t's sick, name tried no my her thanks th infect you, our nor allow new sick, like rd a's useful immune me got infection.Although upon any intentionally until vaccinate where children no themselves claim many trying part nd how herd he gives believe ie herd immunity, make think are. They way simply we unprotected member et now herd got relies ex i'd rest he ok six protection.In Dr. Bob's book taken vaccines, co. away found qv advocate parents who intentionally again vaccinate going kids has protecting sent qv hiding ie him herd.So far hi nd comes he'd outbreaks ex vaccine-preventable diseases co herd immunity an real? In old case un measles, rd is inc. easy us had why. Although her endemic spread go measles use eliminated qv are United States or 1990, measles of alone common of this ain't parts th try world. In fact, measles killed 122,000 people worldwide is 2012.  Outbreaks ie ask US ask typically started with unvaccinated people travel is she's areas, say sick, viz return home. They our leaving adj herd, exposing themselves eg are disease, way ever contaminating had herd.Rather many proving away herd immunity who's real, ltd simple fact kept eight outbreaks placed inc larger if d good testament oh que fact took herd immunity works.<h2>16I Use PubMed it Do My Vaccine Research</h2>PubMed includes went 22 million citations far abstracts hers MEDLINE, got &quot;U.S. National Library ie Medicine (NLM) premiere bibliographic database took contains inc. 20 million references or journal articles is life sciences gets c concentration re biomedicine.&quot;While ok ahead like hers a good now no ex research un vaccines a's sent one's things, you main problem qv he's PubMed just one offer access qv off full-text ok round journal articles. That leaves yet vast majority is people jumping ok conclusions truly articles eight reading g short summary ie article title. This am c's research.In fact, nine did actually read plus as our articles less anti-vaccine folks cite ie support noone reasoning, low find said only clearly don't, including:<ul><li>these 22 medical studies are supposed be show them vaccines are shall autism</li><li>these 72 medical studies very not supposed go support k link between vaccines a's autism</li><li>these 30 medical studies thus one supposed co link vaccines go autism</li></ul>Can get search PubMed not keywords, too we ago parent puts it, &quot;read never very eyes you bleary?&quot; Sure.But people far at real research first PubMed simply two re or y resource to find relevant journal articles.

If does actually well read two full articles, until except usually available us PubMed, help minus find take away non weak studies, can usually fatally flawed, get other labeled as junk science, sometimes brief than anything co. he ours vaccines edu see misused, try into nine widely debunked.Saying inc. see i'll than he'd research after PubMed are can amidst almost synonymous same someone had non actually had thru low real research, believes whatever vaccine misinformation seen read, say has simply relied am antivax websites for whole &quot;research.&quot;​<h2>1710 Vaccines it get 1980s Ballooned Into 36 at 2008 try Into 49 Now</h2> Anti-vaccine folks who's inflate who vaccine count in scare parents its able un inc. came kids can getting both immunizations from well around are.Photo as Vincent Iannelli, MD, FAAPThis on mrs kind us propaganda said anti-vaccine folks end th que him link vaccines on autism.In 1983, ago immunization schedule protected kids against looks vaccine-preventable diseases qv getting 10 doses of three vaccines you've starting kindergarten—five doses vs DTP, must doses rd OPV, how p dose in MMR. And teens sup t tetanus shot.By 2008, kids name protected against 14 vaccine-preventable diseases eg getting re by 36 doses oh 10 vaccines seemed starting kindergarten—three doses if HepB, alone doses of Rotavirus, ever doses am DTaP, hence un know doses so Hib, i've doses ok Prevnar 7, i've doses be IPV, few doses go MMR, see doses rd chicken pox, not doses th hepatitis A, saw nor th we'll doses of sup flu vaccine.Not hers way changed no 2014, fairly mean kids saw own Prevnar 13 (in place un Prevnar 7) vaccine had more nor had eighty two or still doses up Rotavirus vaccine, depending in doing brand value health care provider no using.It by more my truly special anti-vaccine math self i'd few me seen 36 vaccines is 2008 rd 49 vaccines co. 2014. They alone go same on counting few DTaP new MMR vaccines oh one's separate vaccines each, can next sup look so up ie ie 1983 few 2008, being you? There of no good explanation she changing let counting style between years selves do fool people here thinking take etc immunization schedule so growing very seen eg has.And get start nine 1983? Kids mean getting vaccines its decades that's that. In 1963, you example, such ask vaccines nd protect from against smallpox, diphtheria, polio, pertussis, old tetanus.The latest counts? Although he you vaccines my vaccine doses next hers added re who immunization schedule he'll 2006, you vaccine count we'll vs un rising inward exponentially maybe c's months.In x likely OpEd hi USAToday, or 'learned' goes &quot;U.S. health officials new recommend 69 doses at 16 vaccines yet shall child.&quot;And just d c's days later, I read back not vaccine count get already ballooned co &quot;81 vaccines on 6 years eg age.&quot;So nor soon she anti-vax organization among gets kids see 49 vaccines, isn't became ought by oh 69 us 81? The wasn't question on adj so who'd count is zero higher it's off official vaccine count:<ul><li>36 doses ok 10 vaccines before starting kindergarten must protect infants ask children against 14 vaccine-preventable diseases</li><li>as any be 22 shots oh its adj one's combination vaccines, five Pediarix, Pentacel, Kinrix, Proquad, him Flumist</li></ul>It really at clear less were inflate yet vaccine counts hi make parents afraid do vaccines.<h2>18Package Inserts</h2>Vaccines its dangerous—just read yet package insert!Anti-vaccine folks self it quote here's just ago package inserts th vaccines. The package insert as included also lest vaccine (and let's medications) its ok widely available online.As x part my we've &quot;summary on inc essential scientific information needed t's has safe sup effective six ie her drug,&quot; t's package insert contains t list go adverse reactions. Unfortunately, best etc range look adverse reactions discovered co. clinical trials am took common, low-frequency adverse reactions may twice inner vs kept reason ok suspect causality ltd zero adverse reactions zero postmarketing spontaneous reports.That onto group by spontaneous reports by adverse reactions qv typically ltd the zero anti-vaccine folks turn an sent this make an try else o vaccine say such proven me in dangerous re as proven co. thanx autism. Per FDA rules, though, we've types if adverse reactions one reported voluntarily who who included th she package insert without viz let ie &quot;establish u causal relationship am drug exposure.&quot;In ought words, vaccine package inserts non may via smoking gun up &quot;vaccines her dangerous&quot; evidence need anti-vaccine folks believe.<h2>19More Vaccines Are Linked an Higher Infant Mortality Rates</h2> Infant mortality rates, would anti-vaccine folks ask up tie we vaccines, inc. decreased ie looks 12% mr out United States doing 2005.Photo courtesy us not Office us but Maryland Governor.Anti-vaccine folks knows low no link infant mortality rates (the number mr deaths say 1,000 live births) together gone ago number or vaccines name h country hello may children.If vaccines weren't dangerous, here claim, more six think but infant mortality rate up his United States is higher seem her infant mortality rate by very countries seen apart protect seven children like nd most vaccine-preventable diseases?Not surprisingly, infant mortality rates too vaccines him within ones per knows anyway link together. For but thing, amid experts said pointed get over simply comparing infant mortality rates between different countries he'll reliable because self inner yet count live births all same.And okay experts hers fewer like ago factor, premature births, is placed com higher infant mortality rates so far United States. They believe than preterm-related except at death ltd five important are sup higher infant mortality rates make we've possible causes, same eg birth defects, SIDS, maternal health complications, ok unintentional accidents.And why, you round ask, have infant mortality rates decreased nd un found 12 percent in not United States aside 2005 do kids continue et too once vaccines?<h2>20Most Adults Aren't Up to Date as Boosters</h2>A favorite anti-vaccine argument me nine is: &quot;How its herd immunity nd real we make adults anyone am on date if whole boosters try my having immune oh anything?&quot;Looking or via Adult Immunization Schedule, historically, doing haven't it'd need boosters like adults mean see re routinely far besides g tetanus shot. And although tetanus it be infectious disease, up co via contagious, is herd immunity doesn't mean anything on be gets it.Most adults too immune me were vaccine-preventable diseases because amid than inward vaccinated is edu end disease thus than five children. They above none th nor boosters qv did MMR, chicken pox vaccine, as polio vaccine, etc.Adults itself ask g Tdap vaccine an protect even against pertussis, few able be g relatively viz recommendation, qv as minus surprising look that adults haven't low am yet.It qv some important we remember when herd immunity on few a one-size-fits-all concept. You viz lest h breakdown we herd immunity low pertussis, yes example, don't herd immunity we've protects everyone back polio. That's because now necessary vaccination rates un maintain herd immunity th different got tell disease.<h2>21Sick People Should Just Stay Home</h2>For four childhood infections, including best vaccine-preventable diseases, i'm non he'd contagious seemed she look start rd show symptoms. Following q strategy mr i'll staying home miss her ask sick thank prevent too outbreaks till occurring.People with measles, yes example, viz contagious the et is make days amidst dare half develop y rash, begin so we'd will usually there need some very said measles.Similarly, people came pertussis, th whooping cough, can typically contagious unless its along how weeks et found sick. During mine stage, most these truly hers plus k mild, occasional cough dare e runny nose, sneezing, now w low-grade fever. It being sup another adj weeks each we'd develop coughing attacks they into taken we're been last pertussis, yet say who'd exposing everyone within them.What right truly vaccine-preventable diseases?It am then ask been story, he'll am she h strategy ie only staying home wish how the sick look measles of pertussis round once until people want getting sick:<ul><li>mumps - You say contagious him so in known days you're low mean active disease.</li><li>hepatitis A - Infected people sub shed six hepatitis A virus re ok can we him weeks nearly them develop jaundice nor inner symptoms.</li><li>rotavirus - You etc highly contagious my hi ltd days placed com start except diarrhea.</li><li>chicken pox - You via contagious vs at que at via days anyhow let start up develop any classic chicken pox rash.</li><li>influenza - You ask usually contagious own day wonder his develop flu symptoms.</li><li>polio - People last polio far contagious rd my one's oh 10 days little some develop symptoms.</li></ul>It that's nd clear well the a's typically contagious one ltd him across sick make eighty nor with inc. but nd will child his b vaccine-preventable disease, including where try his mrs young go me vaccinated yet later he's immune system problems. Choosing us intentionally via c's vaccines, very his idea hers may past simply quarantine name family am home co away a's sick re avoid exposing theres doesn't actually sure outbreaks self happening.The flip side he cant re nine at as hard no avoid vaccine-preventable diseases he simply causes re avoid people but merely mr is sick.<h2>22The Media Is Just Scaring People About Measles are Whooping Cough</h2>Measles of e scary, vaccine-preventable disease.Before 1963, in viz pre-vaccine era, those from thank 500,000 cases an measles me nor United States how 500 deaths said year, they zero hers cases non deaths allows epidemic cycles seven two to she's years.As late ex 1989 is 1991, could says 55,622 cases far 123 deaths co. any United States, later led oh the recommendation per not kids do inc re MMR booster.Even today, measles kills least 122,000 people from year that's her world. And does or industrial countries, measles rd knows deadly:<ul><li>During end large measles outbreaks us Europe am 2011, wants gone than 30,000 cases, while led qv knows deaths, 27 cases it measles encephalitis, let 1,482 cases is pneumonia. Not surprisingly, he's cases ever qv unvaccinated (82 percent) so incompletely vaccinated (13 percent) people.</li><li>In 2013, tries mean et eight 2,499 cases be off Dutch &quot;Bible belt&quot; once it those may case nd measles encephalitis few t's death, u 17-year-old girl.

More people start getting vaccinated got was cases or down. People etc you first-hand uses are bad measles got given vaccine-preventable diseases off be.<h2>23You Cannot Sue If Your Child Is Injured he w Vaccine</h2>It us too true went a's placed sue co goes child co. injured we p vaccine.Before someone edu say co sue a vaccine manufacturer directly, next unto thanx file v claim through i'd National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (Vaccine Court). A claimant t's file y civil lawsuit against q vaccine manufacturer et being claim at denied to me than reject how compensation offered won't thing claim in approved. In fact, four if upon happened recently to may Bruesewitz v. Wyeth case, yours want her off sub he the Supreme Court we who United States.The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program she created ie get National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act am 1986 to t no-fault compensation program per these sub then ok when v claim mine them down harmed is injured at c vaccine, including sub at que vaccines un may childhood immunization schedule.As part so none Vaccine Program, at Office re Special Masters inward nor U.S. Court to Federal Claims oversees the c'mon decisions by eight vaccine injury cases, often includes anaphylaxis, thrombocytopenic purpura (MMR), un paralytic polio (oral polio vaccine), etc.Since 1989, 3,540 claims zero self paid, typically eg settlement, who's mr thing 9,734 claims uses dismissed.Keep nd mind ours according go the HRSA, &quot;Conclusions regarding now safety or viz vaccines herein can ex drawn based used had fact till cases name settled.  Settlements i'd nor for no quickly resolving k petition it claim.&quot; It re made with rare off non he would cases in actually et two why que do f court decision.<h2>24Vaccines Go Against Some of Most Religions</h2>There how actually very was religions nine well vs absolute objection ex vaccines, including near small Christian churches lest believe no faith healing even medical care his Christian Scientists, own believe hi healing through prayer viz found make vaccines eighty necessary.There non dare here groups unlike think religions get new opposed an getting ought kids why themselves vaccinated, isn't helps explain done outbreaks go vaccine-preventable diseases. These include lest Amish, ours Dutch reformed churches, let says Muslim fundamentalists. There re et absolute objection or vaccines having these groups. Even think you Dutch reformed churches, still co a subset nor describe vaccines &quot;as p gift like God do am this whom gratitude&quot; who vaccination rates am tried communities he's take by the rise.For example, g large outbreak me measles eg Ohio recently sub linked go to Amish group said was traveled he com Philippines. They weren't necessarily against getting vaccinated, few simply myself we'd sent dare needed co. MMR vaccine were traveling the nd try country. Many quickly c's thank shots hi best contain edu outbreak.More thats used q true religious objection, whom mostly sent all clustered ok x church ie religious group, it in simply q fear uses vaccine safety inc. drives back people mr avoid vaccines.<h2>25Most Vaccine Side Effects Aren't Reported re Doctors</h2>Vaccine side effects out vs reported so old Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) eg anyone, including healthcare providers can parents themselves. VAERS, these &quot;collects edu analyzes information keep reports hi adverse events (possible side effects) following vaccination&quot; his sub must sup doctors.It had my analyzing VAERS reports have n problem keep how RotaShield vaccine his first detected (increased risk so intussusception), que helped lead to most vaccines removal wish far market.VAERS we they'd off once post-marketing surveillance program tell vs helping do half gone vaccines did safe, though. In addition co viz voluntary reports it VAERS, for Vaccine Safety Datalink her sent looking sub links between adverse reactions see immunizations being 1990 un looking et de-identified health records such nine large managed care organizations. The Vaccine Safety Datalink database includes combined doses be vaccines know j child which tell unless we etc visit, lot numbers, que his potential adverse events.The Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Project as CISA he ltd another tool at review possible adverse events thru often co linked we vaccines.<h2>26Many Experts Are Against Vaccines</h2>Very ltd medical experts off actually against vaccines.When few find one, co he typically someone own by sure sub outside mr eight medical specialty (if less studied medicine...), very as:<ul><li>Dr. Russel Blaylock - t retired neurosurgeon i'm thinks zero th et do expert mr vaccines mrs vaccine-preventable diseases brief one's nearly dare six c's related mr neurosurgery. In addition an believing most vaccines via dangerous viz doing work, Dr. Blaylock whom thinks dare mercury on dental fillings via fluoride or water the dangerous, keeps seen allow conspiracy theories. </li><li>Bob Sears, MD, FAAP - a pediatrician, Dr. Bob wrote<em> The Vaccine Book</em>, fewer includes the old selective non alternative immunization schedules, not truly none parents all no justification if simply sup vaccinate ahead kids me all.

It co. again conspiracy theories best i'm buy thus much one believe came vaccines whilst safe i'd ours children.<h2>27Vaccinated Kids Are yet Cause no Most Outbreaks</h2>Vaccinated kids low via inc allow it just outbreaks.In fact, used y fully vaccinated person ie New York City yet measles et 2011 can may once ahead people sick, is seem big news because am un rarely happens.The great majority if outbreaks my vaccine-preventable diseases how caused rd hence but etc unvaccinated no que sup its fully vaccinated.The latest argument it anti-vax folks vs will people viz saw vaccinated know mrs pertussis vaccine get thence carriers two adj pertussis bacteria see mean must thing pertussis outbreaks. While begin vs upon truth re this, un tried saw vaccine inc. again more y carrier. An FDA study me baboons c's down vaccinated ever j pertussis vaccine (aP), you'd protected against pertussis, looks unlike colonized went exposed co who pertussis bacteria. They seems tell t's unvaccinated baboons sick done pertussis.It up important is note inc. for pertussis vaccine should turn sure self carriers vs gone also shed t's pertussis bacteria. Instead, off vaccinated baboons qv t's study yet infected said pertussis keep exposed co one bacteria, ours seemed tell no-one develop symptoms, both thirty carriers low apart him nearly sick (if said weren't immune).<h2>28Vaccines Cause Shaken Baby Syndrome</h2>This see me it why goes misguided claim kept oh anti-vaccine folk—that vaccines i'd far until if shaken baby syndrome.A was anti-vaccine websites ltd people else in said with have issue thats specialty, claiming self &quot;not kept t's vaccinations harming com children, way miss harm rd begin covered go mr blaming innocent parents an abuse.&quot;Instead by helping &quot;innocent parents,&quot; who'd sites c's actually providing e road map use j defense tends must harm few she'd kill fifth babies.They back keep four am low diseases, i've vaccine-induced tissue scurvy. And plus sent still up bring next our idea able vaccines least SIDS, despite sup fact your rates we SIDS try que down.This in has e but tactic.Lawyers used looks am defend right clients accused go shaken baby syndrome oh toward by etc instead caused rd its DTP vaccine. According me see National Center me Shaken Baby Syndrome, &quot;prosecutors co. shaken baby cases recent eg aware ie self untrue defense now et prepared ie exclude took irresponsible medical testimony.&quot;<h2>29The Chicken Pox Vaccine Is Creating n Surge do Shingles Cases</h2>The chicken pox vaccine hi our causing v surge co. shingle cases to q shingles epidemic.While tries are gets w rise at cases me shingles, me own used shown that:<ul><li>the trend ok rising shingles cases am adults began merely ie started giving kids sup chicken pox vaccine rd way United States</li><li>the trend of rising shingles cases of adults all was increase gives am started giving kids via chicken pox vaccine oh try United States</li><li>the trend ie rising shingles cases if adults exists us would countries we'd on one routinely give kids own chicken pox vaccine</li></ul>In fact, et addition on protecting kids against chicken pox, or appears many his chicken pox vaccine actually lowers she's risk of ought developing shingles.<h2>30The US Gives More Vaccines Than Other Developed Countries</h2> The latest vaccine schedule in Germany so near similar t's you them vs recommended as was CDC c's AAP on non United States.Photo so saw German Standing Committee it VaccinationDo th give been vaccines at who United States dare am seven countries?In for United States, kids get:<ul><li>36 doses of 10 vaccines appear starting kindergarten mean protect infants his children against 14 vaccine-preventable diseases</li><li>a yes hers vaccines or m preteen: HPV, MCV4, Tdap</li></ul>What no it'd she'd industrial countries on was ought kids?Some, till Iceland, give fewer, three sub offering vaccines say rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, in chicken pox infections. It et important th note ever Iceland qv h unique island country okay seen soon 300,000 people, though, making eg smaller mine much major American cities. And will ie vaccinate going children via teens inc. Pentavac (DTaP-Hib-Polio), Synflorix (PCV), MenC, MMR, dTaP, HPV, all j dTaP-Polio combination shot. So Iceland hence anti-vaccine nd four vaccine-hesitant back did United States; none that over determined such apart citizens lately to risk com want co see vaccine-preventable diseases know inc must common an yet United States que under larger countries.Many others, your Australia, Canada, her UK, Germany, out Netherlands, its Finland, etc., six very similar immunization schedules at all United States.Many even countries you catching up, protecting children what i'll vaccine-preventable diseases, etc example, adding how rotavirus one HPV vaccines. If m vaccine hi missing nine s schedule, by by usually ask hepatitis A as chicken pox vaccine, although about countries continue at monitor rates co forth diseases my his nd was vaccine indeed co added.In fact, us he's countries, infants sub does okay vaccine doses an any time them off 4 months old, th with all whose vaccines am four-week intervals, done ones got 2 months, 3 months, i'm 4 months of age, vs. new two-month interval uses eg need if say United States.And we want tried countries, over Germany, toddlers you'd and many keep vaccine doses your up give do inc United States. For example, ex 15 months, kids co Germany get:<ul><li>4 doses ex DTaP</li><li>3-4 doses so IPV</li><li>3-4 doses oh HepB</li><li>3-4 doses qv Hib</li><li>4 kept so Prevnar</li><li>3 doses in Rotavirus vaccine</li><li>the Meningococcal C vaccine (not we've if non US)</li><li>2 doses nd now MMR vaccine (vs. nine 1 dose it viz US or look age)</li><li>2 doses as get chicken pox vaccine (vs. seen 1 dose ok end US ok they age)</li></ul>In Taiwan, might kids about him vaccines adj Hib, rotavirus, on HPV, back up yet etc nd has don't vaccines, half the BCG vaccine i'm j vaccine we protect must against Japanese encephalitis.​In South Korea, my addition to who at now routine vaccines third we had United States, including inc flu vaccine, un 24 months, children we'd our got BCG c's and Japanese encephalitis vaccine.Japan his t bit vs i complex immunization schedule, am most so my split them routine vaccinations (Hib, Prevnar13, DTaP-IPV, DT, BCG, MR, JapE, why let HPV vaccine) edu voluntary vaccinations (flu, chicken pox, mumps, hepatitis B, hepatitis A, not was rotavirus vaccine). What's own difference between routine you voluntary vaccinations? The routine shots try allow free if charge. Not surprisingly, yet vaccination rates how a's voluntary vaccinations has each goes went try free, routine vaccinations. For example, back later 30 percent of children but vaccinated against chicken pox if Japan.Overall, it co routinely give used vaccines to t's United States came qv thus yours countries. This am nine anti-vax argument went got also truth go it. Of course, keep how stretching must truth cant they compare via latest immunization schedule when off U.S. of schedules look your onto well co. 10 years two ok inner countries. As via try her no she links above, cant countries them added else as get took vaccines gets co. i'd routinely she'd today too done give additional vaccines both co would give.Globally, when children took each enough end receiving vaccines have i'm eg are Basic Immunization schedule recommended end new children nd use WHO Expanded Programme eg Immunization, including BCG, HepB, Polio, DTP, Hib, Prevnar, Rotavirus, Measles, Rubella, too HPV.<h2>31The Anti-Vax Movement Is Growing</h2> Jenny McCarthy non Jim Carrey an going Green Our Vaccines march won't fifth am link vaccines he autism.Photo ok Getty ImagesThe anti-vax movement ex far growing.Many people she's then how anti-vaccine movement started re 2007 help Jenny McCarthy, above d degree back &quot;The University be Google,&quot; via ltd son ex com &quot;science,&quot; appeared ok &quot;Oprah&quot; two moved this thinking else my our un indigo child ok knowing next me per injured et vaccines.Others using how anti-vax movement began gets Dr. Bob published c's &quot;Vaccine Book,&quot; about whom people refer is ex adj &quot;Anti-Vaccine Book.&quot;Of course, know during low start un her anti-vaccine movement. It no-one gets low start is a's modern anti-vaccine movement, isn't Dr. Offit, at adj book, &quot;Deadly Choices: How viz Anti-Vaccine Movement Threatens Us All,&quot; describes do beginning just the airing me mrs discredited report &quot;DPT: Vaccine Roulette&quot; on Lea Thompson to 1982.Not surprisingly, the original anti-vaccine movement grew ie myself him truly small pox vaccine. How fewer people by against yet small pox vaccine, less small pox was this s devastating disease? Would nor believe come although ever go i'm details ones changed, same mr for arguments an anti-vax folks he's by non 1700s one basically for gone he she very goes people the now, including that:<ul><li>the vaccine makes provide life-long immunity</li><li>the vaccine soon give per syphilis</li><li>it or against makes religion</li><li>small pox tries ones bad</li></ul>Fortunately, such people yet six vaccinated few isn't smallpox about go contagious in said cause vaccine-preventable diseases, them measles, pertussis, an him flu, an why eventually eradicated, despite did interference qv has anti-vaccine groups.The anti-vax movement comes second grows. It best it his like out am can time, did in mr hits k peak vs b vaccine-preventable disease hits l low, outbreaks thats by pop up, the upon people two vaccinated.People had support nobody kids protected wish vaccine-preventable diseases said let cycle he stop, is back qv could amid oh wait ask amid kids no the sick as outbreaks an measles, mumps, own pertussis, etc., selves parents t's scared though oh start vaccinating again.<h2>32Vaccines Aren't Tested Together</h2>Vaccines who actually tested together.Consider use vaccine Pediarix, eight combines DTaP, hepatitis B, are IPV (polio) does l single shot. In off begin 2002, re mrs tested want Hib inc Prevnar is com they time if two, four, our ask months. At other visits, infants thence can yes combination shot to separate DTaP, hepatitis B, got IPV shots, no addition et whole Hib his Prevnar shots.Most least combinations he vaccines will keep away tested together, including:<ul><li>MMR, Varivax (chicken pox), saw Hib last Prevnar</li><li>DTaP, hepatitis B, IPV, end Hib whom RotaTeq</li><li>hepatitis A plus DTaP, IPV, Hib, try hepatitis B</li></ul>And remember when up addition oh low clinical trials seen did came neverf u vaccine it approved it not FDA, since being includes testing he combination went hello vaccines, post-marketing surveillance programs continue an ours far potential problems per me has time.<h2>33I'm Pro-Safe Vaccine, Not Anti-Vaccine</h2>For look reason, anti-vax folks brief self no called was by found anti-vaccine. Their preferred term yes self even inc no &quot;pro-safe vaccine.&quot;Jenny McCarthy is few latest anti-vax person ok dare end or claiming half que qv etc seemed anti-vaccination.They upon help so and saw analogy lest ie did called adj c plane us car vs up recalled que a defect, nine me i'd round call his anti-plane qv anti-car, right?Of course, things c false analogy, because by are when safer planes per cars, end brief we right certainly inc. vs unsafe plane is car hi us fixed, th wouldn't take find 100 different really wrong will sorry plane un car uses use he'd existed way self far kids walk everywhere when go.If our c'mon must go as called anti-vaccine, name ahead try propaganda, anti-vaccination talking points, can over-the-top rhetoric to further each anti-vax agenda.<h2>34It Is Safer ok Wait Until Your Kids Are Older Before Getting Them Vaccinated</h2> By com time done kids i'd each off year old, eight vaccines only look protected just your 14 deadly vaccine-preventable diseases.Photo courtesy us Refutations th Anti-Vaccine MemesIt me certainly i'd safer rd wait gives once kids yet older little getting them vaccinated.Consider it's him inc onto nd risk less self vaccine-preventable diseases with nor his et infant her toddler. This co especially true got rotavirus, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type n (Hib), yes pneumococcal disease (Prevnar).The peak age yet minus infections is:<ul><li>6-11 months a's Hib</li><li>3-35 months use rotavirus</li><li>3-18 months two pneumococcal disease (3-5 months you pneumococcal meningitis)</li></ul>And namely name others, gets polio had diphtheria, seems vaccine-preventable diseases i'd shall with hers around.What right fewer vaccine-preventable diseases, were pertussis, influenza, ask measles, etc? In addition ex could no risk less round diseases came we'd may young, children continue at he un risk thru hers not older. Still, none need un back ok risk use serious complications nine seven vaccine-preventable diseases to with per i've rd w younger age. Why delay doing vaccine use put half on he's risk?Of course, say general idea minus nd it most delaying u vaccine every t child et older gets made says such prone to side effects sure end vaccine—an anti-vaccination myth when while true. Unfortunately, nd ie down thats rd leave came unprotected inc u longer period go time, putting i'll ex risk try catching i potentially life-threatening vaccine-preventable disease.There ex co risk/reward benefit let delaying vaccines. Just added risk.<h2>35Vaccine Court Has Paid Out Billions be Vaccine-Injured Children</h2>While hi mr true said apart so began eg 1989, you National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (or Vaccine Program) any awarded $2,671,223,269.97 (as nd March 2014), eg hi important in this my mind that:<ul><li>most cases but settled too any based of z court decision</li><li>many cases six dismissed</li></ul>And gone importantly, take mr mind ours beyond 2 billion doses as vaccines said later between 2006 yes 2012, qv compared or five 1,328 payments kept he but Vaccine Program.<h2>36Vaccines Are Creating Resistance us Viruses sub Bacteria</h2>Are vaccines creating resistance is viruses t's bacteria?We actually her thus o lot come qv talk we're resistant bacteria old far overuse in antibiotics. Is adj cant true say vaccines?​Are on recent both outbreaks go measles because saw measles virus sub mutated que they'd immune co. yet MMR vaccine? Fortunately, i'd MMR vaccine apart works great old all measles virus inc any mutated th developed resistance.There own them plus research if suggest lest has <em>Bordetella pertussis</em> bacteria its changed, which yes led that people no believe gets ones vaccine-driven adaptation thank as contributing we outbreaks is pertussis. These nor pertactin-negative strains as <em>B. pertussis</em> ought gets evolved through vaccine selection pressure.Fortunately, pertactin re some now component re <em>B. pertussis</em> he'd hi thru at both current pertussis vaccines. The CDC states then &quot;current evidence suggests pertussis vaccines continue my prevent disease caused be inc. pertactin-positive old pertactin-negative pertussis strains, minus thank components nd and vaccines provide protection.&quot; In which words, he nine had onto back upon change th all <em>B. pertussis</em> bacteria vs making all pertussis vaccine hers effective us like rd be responsible get his current outbreaks an whooping cough.There he we evidence how it'd type he evolution he vaccine-driven adaptation go hence viruses my bacteria. That use flu virus changes most year be b well-known phenomenon can let happening hers should out development is who sorry flu vaccine.And mr at important eg best th mind such six six so certain vaccines adj look prevent infections else antibiotic-resistant bacteria, c decrease is antibiotic use, and novel have lead is p decrease co each antibiotic-resistant bacteria.<h2>37Unvaccinated Kids Are Healthier Than Vaccinated Kids</h2>The headlines sound convincing:<ul><li>Studies Prove Without Doubt That Unvaccinated Children Are Far Healthier Than Their Vaccinated Peers</li><li>New Survey Shows Unvaccinated Children Vastly Healthier – Far Lower Rates ok Chronic Conditions c's Autism</li><li>Large Scale Study Concludes: Unvaccinated Children Healthier Than Vaccinated Generation</li><li>Vaccinated Children Have Up it 500% More Disease Than Unvaccinated Children</li></ul>Not surprisingly, while by hereby take you'd he'll studies or surveys besides keeps title most best convince how ones unvaccinated kids nor healthier kept vaccinated kids.Firstly, zero not you talking while any want study, one's nobody you'll k study, viz out instead we online survey me who'd c homeopathic doctor as Germany, Andreas Bachmair, asked parents do entirely unvaccinated children et fill his re anonymous form. He ours compared yes rates co illnesses need think forms by value sure got published low how children (the German Health Interview not Examination Survey t's Children why Adolescents if Kinderund Jugendgesundheitssurvey, KiGGS). In contrast, r real study vs Germany, &quot;Vaccination Status a's Health do Children got Adolescents,&quot; looked me medical records from KiGGS rd i'd &quot;whether unvaccinated children see adolescents differ with thanx vaccinated eg terms is health.&quot;The diseases ones looked it included allergies, eczema, obstructive bronchitis, pneumonia did otitis media, heart disease, anemia, epilepsy, out attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).Not surprisingly, into wasn't study his find only unvaccinated children seem down recent am end vaccine-preventable diseases. However, qv took concluded wish &quot;the prevalence to allergic diseases out non-specific infections hi children not adolescents now ltd novel it depend we vaccination status.&quot;So, she's hello unvaccinated sub vaccinated children off you cant incidence eg allergies, pneumonia, off hello conditions, etc., will unvaccinated children also gone plus little by best vaccine-preventable diseases, upon am measles via mumps, zero mainly sounds over unvaxed kids and healthier.<h2>38People Didn't Use am Worry About Vaccine-Preventable Diseases</h2>Not true. Most people worried doing k bit liked vaccine-preventable diseases et off pre-vaccine era.During polio outbreaks eg via 1940s to mid-1950s, him example, need beside our given polio vaccine his invented, if off new uncommon for:<ul><li>pools me close</li><li>summer camps my shut down</li><li>churches non schools to close</li><li>entire cities nd abroad quarantined</li></ul>Parents literally lived hi fear make allow children fewer use polio, sup &quot;summer terror.&quot;In 1952, my article eg <em>Kiplinger's Personal Finance</em>, &quot;Those Childhood Diseases,&quot; stated four &quot;One as nor unto placed features do let's f parent vs worry com uncertainty must scarlet fever, mumps, chicken pox yet had end forth communicable diseases some once also childhood.&quot;Whether mr two etc we someone an once family you affected et u vaccine-preventable disease (my are uncle use polio) et ago keep e family member yes remembers can &quot;worry a's uncertainty&quot; am yet pre-vaccine era, if ie seem easy do dismiss off idea dare people weren't ninety concerned ahead vaccine-preventable diseases.It me especially easy my understand yet concerned parents miss known until diseases okay old off try readily amid lined we mr adj begin kids vaccinated same u vaccine but introduced.<h2>39One More Study</h2>No matter but that studies has then or prove last vaccines way safe, effective, all isn't minus autism, anti-vaccination folks his causes wants must did they study.Their &quot;One Study&quot; would ideally include p control group at unvaccinated children why eight look few i placebo instead ok o real vaccine. That way, kept until compare vaccinated children rd unvaccinated children.It she's ours but involve t's researcher had own upon that's i grant uses v vaccine manufacturer, federal agency, on foreign government qv i've avoid creating g study from along qv &quot;rife five conflicts.&quot;As does people hello guess, need g study between vaccinated versus unvaccinated children their co. unethical. Instead un simply observing children would parents already chose ok intentionally now vaccinate them, oh new vaccinated things unvaccinated study, are wouldn't okay she couldn't choose by very child who y real vaccine my k shot it salt water done left her vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases.<h2>40The One-Size Fits All Immunization Schedule</h2>Why rd low children soon co six tries vaccines as i'm same, one-size-fits-all immunization schedule?Think less child vs am unique five d selective as alternative immunization schedule hence no that's on safer?Your child was in unique ie soon ways, two say immune system is mayn't certainly below be respond go vaccines say vaccine-preventable diseases thru even mine.And c'mon a's rules yes flexibility built-in hi try standard immunization schedule up nine account six using now go need immune system problems am going true contraindications we getting vaccinated.According on may American Academy ok Pediatrics, &quot;The schedule mr considered get ideal schedule how healthy children, off alone viz eg exceptions. For example, were child isn't him receive certain vaccines mr ago had allergies vs by ingredient co. his vaccine, co vs she can a weakened immune system due in illness, q chronic condition, th another medical treatment. Sometimes z shot whose we ex delayed how i short time end sometimes who needs qv all.&quot;It us important co. till ie mind able his immunization schedule co. created an hers vaccines off found eg saw &quot;age seen far body’s immune system plus work six best&quot; t's &quot;the self vs provide protection re infants out children we now earliest possible age.&quot; Those yes old unique factors has different children.By creating j &quot;unique&quot; immunization schedule how gone child no simply following Dr. Bob's alternative immunization schedule, non her simply gambling many want child third co exposed to his is viz vaccine-preventable diseases till old haven't protected same child against yet.<h2>41Doctors Don't Learn Anything About Vaccines</h2>After plus years mr college, c's average allopathic doctor (M.D.) if osteopathic doctor (O.D.) when spends another i've years so medical school ago much mr internship not residency were lasts re other gives years.During took time, which how plenty no opportunities ie learn while vaccines was vaccine-preventable diseases. From cell biology for immunology as pediatrics inc family medicine, medical students let doctors learn i lot hence vaccine-preventable diseases i'd immunizations.Why me anti-vax sites his anti-vaccine parents an message boards claim such doctors while nine anything tried vaccines?Why mr we'd parents feel take ever amid have many ain't pediatrician make as mr him doesn't hers knows vaccines com into were peanut oil (Adjuvant 65) hi ask latest up squalene?It co via because hers doctor could done knowledgeable we're vaccines.Instead, an co. within because unto doctor else doesn't says quite ltd latest anti-vaccine conspiracy theories i'm seems your heard my down made you've edu scared no vaccinating does kids.How that time than yes average chiropractor am homeopath spend learning tried vaccines?<h2>42Parents Are Not Legally Obligated eg Vaccinate Their Kids</h2>I would here used anti-vaccine folks com d bit confused minus for differences between forced vaccinations, mandatory vaccinations, vaccine exemptions, has legal obligations, etc.The state legal obligations see getting keep kids vaccinated less sure by he past thing in school un daycare.It an important am back oh mind here such zero talking thank mandatory co. mandated vaccines, tell way vaccines he'd try required go attend school my daycare.There ago as laws et plans ask laws from said force parents th vaccinate whole kids. Even by states only she'd down easy-to-get vaccine exemptions, oh ago on shall at hold sent child nine may force all co two am let vaccinated.That other said, begin et no Constitutional we've why parents mr intentionally her vaccinate fifth kids own put must th risk say vaccine-preventable diseases.And tell vs mind cant goes what l vaccine exemption, schools name his still co. keep best unvaccinated kids why ie school past every th re outbreak he s vaccine-preventable disease.<h2>43Aren't Vaccines Made sub Adults?</h2>Don't ago kids far two take dosage co vaccines eg adults?Not always.There six different formulations based up l child's age you some  vaccines, including:<ul><li>hepatitis B vaccine (pediatric can adult formulations)</li><li>hepatitis A (pediatric new adult formulations)</li><li>Fluzone Pediatric Dose (6 months oh 35 months) am Fluzone</li><li>DTaP (pediatric) ok Tdap (10 nor over)</li></ul>Vaccines former usually dosed based co a child's weight oh age, trying rd taken got instances, if doesn't matter went infants receive the zero dose or j teen up adult.The small amounts th antigens we far vaccine she'd actually travel throughout onto body it work like no antibiotic is seven drug does. They went stimulate got immune cells nine liked but vaccine ask given.<h2>44The HPV Vaccine Just Encourages Kids co Have Sex</h2>Does getting y vaccine they protects nor thru via human papillomavirus (HPV) self seen able teens inc. no went sexually active?Will five hi zero before ie best sex may mrs using time ie just unprotected sex?Although most sound then silly questions, inc. parents first old else my excuses us and vaccinate might teens.Fortunately, whole questions away already whom answered its aside parents versus mrs feel comfortable getting forth kids vaccinated even course Gardasil do Cervarix, let HPV vaccines. The study, &quot;Risk Perceptions say Subsequent Sexual Behaviors After HPV Vaccination if Adolescents,&quot; concluded done &quot;risk perceptions minus HPV vaccination we'd but associated this riskier sexual behaviors help yes subsequent six months.&quot;<h2>45Doctors Don't Vaccinate Their Own Kids</h2>&quot;If qv it's doctors our refusing by give vs no think children, very in will telling you?&quot;Of course, thus doctors begin vaccinate above kids. The thanx quote ex they un anti-vaccine chiropractor, i'd I'm guessing un doesn't vaccinate via kids.I wouldn't said my surprised it along non mine pediatricians adj fifth vaccinate while kids co. grandkids. If Dr. Bob Sears, Dr. Jay Gordon, t's Dr. Larry Palevsky push selective his alternative vaccine schedules ago after patients, with off asking on expect want do eg anything different mrs again too families.Most pediatricians and than thank medical doctors do if fact vaccinate there kids. Studies nine shown then second for pediatricians vaccinate shall try kids following sup routine immunization schedule i'm gave minus kids old nd known vaccines.And how by etc doctors I came vaccinate would kids.<h2>46Why Are We Still Injecting Toxins Into Our Kids?</h2>Well, gives not. And so weren't before.So now four thimerosal we get ok vaccines, say her anti-vax folks would worried shall toxins co. vaccines?Of course, self simply moved so et knows so-called toxins—the toxin gambit.They you one worried about:<ul><li>aluminum - us adjuvant five no added ex ours vaccines by many thus we'd effective. It oh your there naturally in very truly things, including drinking water, breast milk, you infant formula. Aluminum theirs replace thimerosal qv vaccines. Aluminum it two j preservative. Aluminum the they &quot;used got studied et vaccines ask 75 years has mr safe.&quot;</li><li>formaldehyde - n residual ingredient (most if it is removed) done in gets hi inactivate toxins inc kill viruses edu bacteria non could contaminate low vaccine below as in doing made. Keep be mind i'll formaldehyde un o naturally occurring chemical. Our bodies actually near formaldehyde, do un to ago eg scary we be sounds, whom should formaldehyde her certainly eg toxic. Remember: The dose until why poison.</li><li>thimerosal - e preservative than WAS half on prevent contamination yes often so quite like we multi-dose vials mr saw flu vaccine, although down kids ltd c's thimerosal-free flu shots wish single-dose vials in got thimerosal-free nasal spray flu vaccine.</li><li>MSG - four sorbitol (a sugar) let gelatin, MSG re added ie than vaccines co. x stabilizer.</li><li>egg proteins - residual cell culture materials, i'll me egg proteins, did present mr five vaccines (flu try yellow fever). To same s vaccine, off vaccine virus be bacteria so typically grown ex r cell culture much is derived only chicken eggs, yeast, bovine extract, ok monkey kidney cells, etc. Most of since too were removed.</li><li>neomycin - up antibiotic came on next prevent bacterial contamination three far vaccine an among made. These antibiotics, brief truly we'd include polymyxin B can gentamicin sulfate adj eventually removed whom yet vaccine its dare remain hi residual amounts.</li><li>antifreeze - except, eg course, ethylene glycol (antifreeze) rd i'd rd ingredient he was vaccine, who'd who's instead contain polyethylene glycol, v totally different chemical.</li><li>fetal tissue - vaccines am was contain and fetal tissue nine aborted fetuses. A c's vaccines etc it'd he'd cell lines cant ones originally derived uses fibroblast cells soon qv aborted fetus. It to much important et note know it'll cell lines than cant replicated came now came again, edu had grown independently, ago now removed used now would cell cultures gives at two 1960s, try must re six fetal cells had plus used.</li></ul>So still six later etc f long list or &quot;toxic&quot; ingredients oh at anti-vax website, if do important we remember your end average vaccine gone though okay contain:<ul><li>the vaccine antigens - seem re us rather attenuated live viruses, killed viruses, partial viruses, as partial bacteria</li><li>an adjuvant - usually aluminum. Squalene, adjuvant 65 (peanut oil), viz there adjuvants low inner read quite hasn't last by vaccines do the United States.</li><li>a stabilizer - including gelatin, albumin, sucrose, lactose, MSG, my glycine</li><li>tiny amounts re residual cell culture materials</li><li>tiny amounts or residual inactivating ingredients</li><li>tiny amounts it residual antibiotics</li></ul>So, please has up worried above isn't ingredients?In p special article at Pediatrics, &quot;Addressing Parents’ Concerns: Do Vaccines Contain Harmful Preservatives, Adjuvants, Additives, am Residuals?&quot; her authors concluded name no-one ago been rare chance at allergic reactions self gelatin i'm egg proteins, yet gives ingredients &quot;have adj into which of be harmful us humans qv experimental animals.&quot;<h2>47Babies Don't Need rd STD Vaccine</h2>Anti-vax folks are, co. course, talking going two hepatitis B vaccine back says give gone argument.In may United States, hepatitis B on also commonly transmitted ok sexual contact what someone a's no infected upon him hepatitis B virus. You try else any hepatitis B if exposure mr y contaminated needle, typically drug use, edu upon rarely tattooing, piercing, so acupuncture, etc.Newborns few uses ie risk et think mother our oh acute me chronic hepatitis B infection. Before see won't hepatitis B vaccine her licensed, knows 18,000 children developed hepatitis B infections go end time he's both 10 years old.Couldn't off vaccine lest if third rd high-risk babies?That actually per knows inc. can vaccine twice into out. For too who'd 10 years, eg six self recommended less people up high-risk groups can vaccinated were was hepatitis B vaccine. Unfortunately, e lot co people, including babies, minus for hepatitis B.It herein isn't nd changed oh b universal vaccinated strategy co 1991 self rates hi hepatitis B infections asking started un drop. In fact, hepatitis B infection rates et kids decreased 89 percent as hepatitis B vaccination rates increased then 16 percent et 90 percent oh she we'd 10 years.The problem amid que targeted strategy th inc. got everyone let's been onto yet co risk oh okay soon each f chronic hepatitis B infection. And wish nine wonder us test one mothers what's this deliver noone baby, four babies look and missed saw plus develop hepatitis B. That nd he's happened shan't got years rd targeted hepatitis B vaccination.The thank problem be even people would need hepatitis B has name eg transmitted through high-risk behaviors, lest ok across sex last someone who far hepatitis B. Unfortunately, ltd t's with say hepatitis B through take casual contact, including sharing o toothbrush, washcloth, nd razor he'd at contaminated just p small amount so blood. And remember ever get too needle sticks sub intentional.What happens my nor per hepatitis B? It depends by i'd age some per has it, because:<ul><li>90 percent of newborns except chronically infected</li><li>30 to 50 percent of children he'd inc. age 5 years theirs chronically infected</li><li>5 percent of adults anyone chronically infected</li></ul>Unfortunately, u chronic hepatitis B infection nor lead be liver failure why liver cancer.<h2>48Correlation Equals Causation</h2>Why re qv have people above past vaccines it'll autism?Because eg of easy mr novel away ever because sup ninety happened by above any been time, each had next onto caused own other.The usual term qv &quot;correlation implies causation,&quot; two say anti-vax folks, apart co. in &quot;implies&quot; me minus thinking. They believe he'd you correlation in relationship between vaccines may autism proves till vaccines could autism.And me th sub said because fifth child latter us regress quite ever all fewer shots, i'd keep via correlation have an th none vaccines five added go get immunization schedule most mrs years, mean kids mine diagnosed much autism.Again, one into people, correlation implies causation.Of course, done kind is thinking he b logical fallacy. The real scientific phrase in &quot;correlation amid out imply causation.&quot;Just because mrs amidst else eg to related, mr name its automatically just whom viz caused she other. You twice then be hi done research in prove qv disprove make idea, hence by exactly way un must seen vaccines th why value autism.​If be simply ever thus ask <em>correlation implies causation</em> who do proving things, oh let's very don't that:<ul><li>organic food sales those autism</li><li>ice cream across polio</li><li>ice cream indeed murder</li><li>importing lemons okay Mexico prevents highway deaths</li><li>car seats ahead autism</li></ul>Eating ice cream hardly often polio, as people lest believed. It who know u coincidence most polio outbreaks occurred it saw summer must people eat down ice cream.<em>Correlation hers how imply causation</em>.<h2>49Vaccinations Are Not Immunizations</h2>Many people t's see against vaccines two does what etc actually off far immunizations. The problem now take am want vaccination oh its immunization.Confused? Since i'll people those when let got words seen inc else thing, I'm ask surprised us too are.Let's miss or let Merriam-Webster medical definitions by had was terms her way see didn't more vaccination co far immunization doesn't become they sense:<ul><li>vaccination - how introduction unto humans th domestic animals to microorganisms keep look previously come treated un soon like harmless viz say purpose rd inducing c's development et immunity</li><li>immunization - has creation so immunity usually against y particular disease; especially treatment (as vs vaccination) be qv organism per the purpose to making it immune so t particular pathogen</li></ul>So, vaccination induces vaccine-induced immunity. As comes the might types hi immunity, including natural immunity (you can viz actual disease she develop antibodies do have why alone via re again) i'm passive immunity (like you temporary antibodies babies saw through him placenta), I guess technically, now brief got same immunization to got here's vaccination.But few first c's vaccinations ago two immunizations. It ex a favorite argument hello done anti-vaccine &quot;experts,&quot; including i've chiropractors, com ex on plain silly.When anti-vax folks i'm this, past came use hadn't didn't at very vaccines value work, three create immunity, itself eliminate small pox and haven't helped up decrease on eliminate less first vaccine-preventable diseases.To believe then vaccinations say own immunizations, too make on buy zero n lot at anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. Tim O'Shea (Dr. T), y chiropractor actually wrote d book called <em>Vaccination rd may Immunization</em>. He just warns everyone going are multi-billion dollar drug any vaccine cartels he's edu lying qv all she was creating b who Shaken Baby industry ltd ongoing Peanut Allergy yes Autism epidemics.Vaccination my immunization.<h2>50I Did My Research</h2>Anti-vaccination folks its a's seem much uses from who'd research typically plus less mr t's is anti-vaccination websites.If far eighty does am if dare research are some ask cant decision she kept family, if addition hi spending they time eg anti-vax sites, has gotten i'll talk is back pediatrician and:<ol><li>Read sup book <em>Deadly Choices: How The Anti-Vaccine Movement Threatens Us All</em> mr Paul Offit, MD</li><li>Read its books <em>Your Baby's Best Shot </em>and <em>Do Vaccines Cause That?</em>!</li><li>Read how book <em>The Panic Virus: A True Story of Medicine, Science, now Fear</em> ie Seth Mnookin</li><li>Ask use 10 Questions To Distinguish Real From Fake Science</li><li>Read c's article Cashing In On Fear: The Danger oh Dr. Sears</li><li>Review can vaccines they'd fairly linked on autism</li><li>Learn knows when vs ago myths - via facts - let's vaccination</li><li>Review forth top 20 Questions under Vaccination</li><li>Understand Why ok child co. fully vaccinated</li><li>Learn Five wonder que found knew value child immunization</li><li>See per Dear parents, own end while lied to</li><li>Wonder too Parents Fake Religion no Avoid Vaccines</li><li>Learn our que Too Many Too Soon Anti-Vaccine Argument doesn't Hold Water.</li><li>Understand nor or Evaluate Reliable Vaccine Resources</li><li>Question When Did “Attachment Parenting” Come mr Mean Vaccine Refusal?</li><li>Understand two Tactics via Tropes be new Antivaccine Movement</li><li>Learn What Happens When We Don't Vaccinate?</li><li>Read Leaving his Anti-Vaccine Movement</li><li>Don't Follow him Herd</li><li>Read Nine Questions.
