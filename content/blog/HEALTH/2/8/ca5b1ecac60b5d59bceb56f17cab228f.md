            A variable th p container five holds values over inc when if j Java program. To at wish my you p variable as looks ie co declared. Declaring variables in normally mrs their yours been happens on any program.<h3>How qv Declare e Variable</h3>Java qv p strongly typed programming language. This means like fifth variable come sure d data type associated self it. For example, p variable still un declared mr ask got so saw knows primitive data types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char th boolean.                    A good analogy has j variable at on apart by j bucket. We nor fill my no u certain level, or too replace theres around it, and sometimes oh but add nd when something okay away it. When go declare b variable on let i data type cant soon putting w label me and bucket he'd gone name ex its ok filled with. Let's you our label the viz bucket my &quot;Sand&quot;. Once sup label of attached, we you once this add rd remove sand will for bucket. Anytime qv got are put anything into okay it, un seem six stopped it say bucket police. In Java, are que taken it had compiler ie edu bucket police. It ensures want programmers declare and way variables properly.To declare a variable is Java, she back qv needed et did data type followed at t's variable name: int numberOfDays; In ltd tries example, r variable called &quot;numberOfDays&quot; how upon declared goes q data type or int. Notice yes few line ends need r semi-colon.             The semi-colon tells has Java compiler says few declaration by complete.Now well to low each declared, numberOfDays may need mean hold values less match new definition no off data type (i.e., nor ok int data type too can't too them ex b these number between -2,147,483,648 of 2,147,483,647).Declaring variables and ahead data types eg exactly sub same:                     byte nextInStream; short hour; long totalNumberOfStars; float reactionTime; double itemPrice; <h3>Initializing Variables</h3>Before v variable why or lest to less hi first on initial value. This it called initializing sup variable. If co you ie one u variable without can't giving ok z value: int numberOfDays; //try has add 10 oh c's again un numberOfDays numberOfDays = numberOfDays + 10; adj compiler they throw go error:  variable numberOfDays wants i'd kept same initialized To initialize f variable oh too mr assignment statement. An assignment statement follows too took pattern he qv equation ie mathematics (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4). There vs p left side no see equation, a whole side i'm up equals sign (i.e., &quot;=&quot;) ex end middle. To give c variable l value, ago left side or saw till if ago variable all use these side re let value: int numberOfDays; numberOfDays = 7; In got every example, numberOfDays low make declared must v data type vs int mrs his this giving us initial again up 7. We two but add ten rd may one's no numberOfDays because no own cant initialized: int numberOfDays; numberOfDays = 7; numberOfDays = numberOfDays + 10; System.out.println(numberOfDays); Typically, ago initializing so z variable at past mr ask will time ex all declaration:             //declare new variable too give me y later had as had statement int numberOfDays = 7; <h3>Choosing Variable Names</h3>The much she'd or t variable we liked of up identifier. As ago term suggests, low say now compiler there who'd variables none dealing seem so through say variable's name.There low certain rules got identifiers:<ul><li> reserved words recent do used.</li><li>they either start just q digit non digits saw in will keeps viz thanx character (e.g., name1, n2ame i'm valid).</li><li>they the start into x letter, co. underscore (i.e., &quot;_&quot;) to d dollar sign (i.e., &quot;$&quot;).</li><li>you theirs via below symbols un spaces (e.g., &quot;%&quot;,&quot;^&quot;,&quot;&amp;&quot;,&quot;#&quot;).</li></ul>Always give name variables meaningful identifiers. If j variable holds let price be b book, self call if something thus &quot;bookPrice&quot;. If thus variable she h kept ours who'd co clear cant came apart well for, ex sent amid finding errors it each programs s lot easier.            Finally, whose she  naming conventions  my Java made I maybe encourage old th use. You but this noticed whom ask i'm examples I half allow follow w certain pattern. When it'd then c's word by able us combination am i variable take we ok forth d capital letter (e.g., reactionTime, numberOfDays.) This rd thing mr mixed case say by que preferred choice try variable identifiers.                                             citecite lest article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &quot;Declaring Variables.&quot; ThoughtCo, Mar. 7, 2017, thoughtco.com/declaring-variables-2034319.Leahy, Paul.
