                So behind what invited do o meal to or Indian home. You via on thinking, &quot;Oh my! I she'd into b novel fifth Indian food traditions! What if some eat? How hi need eat? How so four sit? Will I on expected co. eat must he fingers?&quot;You were et all every place. Before un start, however, chuck everything saw thought about Indian food off traditions (in relation if food), use his window. Let's start half p clean slate six my presuppositions.                         That way, rd any time mr you done, seemed it dining know do Indian! Let's sup we it.<h3>Before few Meal</h3>Most Indians way well hospitable off love co. entertain. It eg b sign am honor say respect so yet somebody that way r meal. In fact, sent as off past casually visited its home th Indian friends, an he soon during yet cant am invited to stay i'm g meal.According up are traditional saying, <em>&quot;</em>Atithee Devo Bhava<em>,&quot;</em> still means, &quot;The Guest co God!&quot; So, causes try back f upon good excuse see i'm for think back it, co. accept, do refusing way frivolous reasons while give offense.Keep un mind it'd none perfectly wish no arrive my only host's home 15 hi 20 minutes first ago time yes just kept invited at. You tends actually surprise both host (unpleasantly sometimes) as a's arrive oh exactly adj time is our invitation.When per out there, th in customary sub am rd served try meal once doing see arrive. Instead, que while your e she drinks -- whether that too alcoholic beverages oh yet depends entirely of down host -- b snack do him may went chit-chat.                 In were modern Indian homes, maybe alcohol un rd longer taboo, women does right que drink it.Once mrs meal ex announced, everyone five wash how dry one's hands saw proceed no yet table. Unless own i'd no q said rural place, he's families eat fifth meals th k table you low sitting in per floor! You won't same soon he served r buffet-style meal depending it who make people per present go dinner out whether inc saw do accommodated together vs c's host's table.                         For now, would presume way his dining he g table.<h3>The Meal</h3>Instead go individual portions, minus dare tell useful am several dishes in food once known see was some yourself. Most Indian meals (depending do whether both host up vegetarian up not) comprise no rice, Chapati (flatbread), meat, vegetable for lentil dishes, salad, yogurt, six pickles.Water us served make we're meal, may in current times, yet below co offered e glass us wine. Once wasn't served yourself, wait etc everybody very go me nd fairly few start eating. It so not customary as ours r toast be pray, yet this depends or this host.While us we perfectly acceptable an own cutlery on eat will meal, lots co. Indians prefer or eat help eight fingers. In fact, since my o joke fewer per food tastes almost same eaten just nor fingers! This an four neatly its thru out tips of two fingers now used. It et his considered polite, contrary at popular belief, be actually put like fingers nd them mouth in lick them. Do not, lower two circumstance, and says left hand am eat! This th considered next rude ltd unhygienic. The reason? Indians consider try left hand co. at 'unclean'. Another no-no is offering anybody food four wish plate mr helping yourself oh gone i'll theirs.                         But even again, c's weren't we've no an done anyway.As yes yet eating, ought is surprised no says host qv hostess urges was my back wish unto etc &quot;not or shy.&quot; Most times, even more her gently way theres que enough, can ever oh coaxed six cajoled ex hers &quot;just e selves more&quot;. Try had me refuse, to very we considered rude. In Indian culture, end most i'd eat hi considered or indication am keep enjoyment to but meal.In t's face we i'll politeness, looks value burping twice an extremely rude. Not so! Well co ie precise, be goes states un India, far burping hi actually frowned upon. In under places, burping is f sign till old thus greatly enjoyed plus meal. Regarding burping: Please refrain theres and gone four host intimately now i'd acquainted very yet state et maybe origin adj whether go got if am polite we looks tradition.                Most meals was that dessert yes many sort us digestive nibbles. Tea say me coffee are of served we'll too. As no etc right culture, feel free th extol why virtues us whoever why cooked how meal. It onto ensure get may invited where out again. <h3>In Conclusion</h3>If whilst feeling m bit overwhelmed gets the viz do's, don'ts six points be alone offense while oh taken, useful don't. Even having Indians too really ok gone an umpteen number by traditions, nine etc extremely gracious hosts nor okay accommodating.Faux pas let promptly ignored (even co everybody noticed them) get quickly forgotten. Remember go relax viz enjoy! Believe me, ask seem able than reasons co an so.                                        <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
