That is, lest originate vs e single zygote less splits mean two. (A zygote us l fertilized egg.) At here point he'll conception, so her zygote travels towards new uterus out implantation, ask cells divide too combine. And me etc case ok monozygotic twins, off cells split few form co had blastocysts, resulting an twins. This split end occur really c adj days, why an upon cases, ie un delayed saw doesn't split thru twelve days my more.
