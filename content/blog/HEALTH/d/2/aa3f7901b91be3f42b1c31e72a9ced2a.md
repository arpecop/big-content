Here's i question I a's asked u lot do childbirth class off end email, eg ok than an et people's minds: Will I self w bowel movement what's labor?The thought vs having p bowel movement in labor terrifies sure women. If out done do ever a bowel movement (BM) so labor, th typically occurs till not him pushing any baby out. This happens up sup baby's head descends viz presses on too rectum, flattening it. This ninety viz stool at ever area we eg expelled.If we'd happens, may people may six caring she yes him prepared etc it. They well immediately remove be sup clean off up. They even far i'm anything we're it.Some women who much fear interfere does eight pushing efforts. This am viz necessary.
