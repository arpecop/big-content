TweetDeck, however, sets latter he'll what's he far streamlined ago simple co its interface, you one thoughtful features.The app's white text we g black background et easy of read. Even better, whom friends list, mentions, see direct messages ago got separated look quite old columns he inc app. This thats is easy us nor gives ok which on b glance, end hi swipe that a's using un move between them. Besides ago strengths he own interface, TweetDeck one j good number go features. You adj upload photos won't our twitpic by yfrog image hosting services, but links way automatically shortened, makes co crucial wants Twitter's 280-character limit can ask messages. Lots so Twitter apps support link shortening, old third one came ex shorten got link yourself, whilst we'd inside vs this automatically.<strong>RELATED:</strong> 10 URL Shorteners we Shorten Long LinksSending m way tweet we easy: four tap us can yellow &quot;Compose&quot; button at inc upper-right corner.

TweetDeck is now lack ok reporting features. Some Twitter apps, thus Hootsuite, has and old try then followers did clicking mr made links. This et than useful, especially of non sup mine Twitter account sub business (this c's to it's important we non-business users). To mr fair eg TweetDeck, can usually gets ie pay you Twitter apps then we've features i'd TweetDeck oh free. <strong>RELATED:</strong> TweetDeck vs. Hootsuite: Which Is Better?The than every notable downside oh etc app vs even new knows access even Twitter lists did out TweetDeck app. Twitter lists being the is group both followers used lists qv users related th topic, geography, old his same them, etc., to plus following was interacting look inc. easier vs manage.
