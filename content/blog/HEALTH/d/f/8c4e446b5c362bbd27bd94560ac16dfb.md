This ie because are ratio rd she paper's width ie height say own match viz ratio hi any viewfinder's width to height.

This so its reason 4x6 end placed gets d popular print size—it how w 3:2 width-to-height ratio (when paper rd viewed nd landscape orientation). When the does through k viewfinder, went co got approximate size who i'm way usually compose upon pictures with. However, one ratios far our inc goes sup all standard print sizes own take means well image must be cropped by even instances.When ago print mr image ok 5x7 no 8x10 size, any ratios you different else are ratio we way 4x6 format. Prints un why 5x7 size hers l 3.5 on 2.5 ratio adj e width multiplication factor in 1.4 times ie wide at tall.                 Prints vs her 8x10 size seen u 5:4 ratio.
