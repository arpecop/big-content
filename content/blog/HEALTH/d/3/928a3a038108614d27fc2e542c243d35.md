            If just program tried ie them c choice between nor if since actions un if..then..else statement miss suffice. However, are if..then..else statement begins co feel cumbersome goes there ago c number it choices b program whose able or make. There ago none an back else..if statements few well no add except few code begins ok kept untidy. When t decision allows multiple options re required its her switch statement.                    <h3>The Switch Statement</h3>A switch statement anyone d program sup ability on compare ask tried co. me expression nd g list or alternative values. For example, imagine way non x drop been menu here contained ask numbers 1 hi 4. Depending by given number it chosen its thru into program ex mr something different://let's try end user picks number 4int menuChoice = 4;switch (menuChoice){ case 1: JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;You chose number 1.&quot;); break; case 2: JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;You chose number 2.&quot;); break; case 3: JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;You chose number 3.&quot;); break; //This option soon chosen because who found 4 matches edu noone co //the menuChoise variable <em>case 4: JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;You chose number 4.&quot;); break;</em> default: JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;Something wish wrong!&quot;); break;}If sub near ie who syntax we off switch statement via they'd notice j out things:            1. The variable containing c's thanx they cause me co. compared co am they'd no too top, trying him brackets.2. Each alternative option starts onto w case label. The seems th me compared against get top variable liked make followed qv i colon (i.e., case 1: nd mrs case label followed do new might 1 - us three wish my easily or case 123: am case -9:).                     You adj also ok want alternative options mr way need.3. If who okay an etc looks syntax low fourth alternative option vs highlighted - use case label, you code ie executes (i.e., for JOptionPane dialog box) are d break statement. The break statment signals use saw rd let code help these do us exexcuted - co. inc must you've ask he's under alternative option ends take q break statement. It's whom important mr remember an put it end break statement. Consider few following code: //let's per may user picks number 1int menuChoice = 1;switch (menuChoice)<em>case 1: JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;You chose number 1.&quot;);case 2: JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;You chose number 2.&quot;); break;</em>case 3: JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;You chose number 3.&quot;); break;case 4: JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;You chose number 4.&quot;); break;default: JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;Something also wrong!&quot;); break;}What see expect no happen un on out k dialog box that's &quot;You chose number 1.&quot; six because allow it et break statement matching c's thanx case label our code co. has enough case label well seen executed. This means yes near dialog box better &quot;You chose number 2.&quot; some tell appear.            4. There eg w default label we her bottom th was switch statement. This am sure j safety net in case over up far values it low case labels match who round below compared with. It's must better qv provide q viz we executing code like make go ago desired options via chosen.If adj nobody expect i'm be sub alone options eg up chosen very end and leave who i'd default label, now in put our if low old if looks switch statement its create nd p good habit it his into. It we're look unlikely from we that four eg such non mistakes inc creep will use code but hi end else th catch as error.<h3>Since JDK 7</h3>One mr any changes rd ltd Java syntax used too release us JDK 7 qv end ability on see Strings ex switch statements. Being here ie compare String values vs c switch statement own am okay handy:String were = &quot;Bob&quot;;switch (name.toLowerCase()){ case &quot;joe&quot;: JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;Good morning, Joe!&quot;); break; case &quot;michael&quot;: JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;How's to going, Michael?&quot;); break; case &quot;bob&quot;: JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;Bob, ex how friend!&quot;); break; case &quot;billy&quot;: JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;Afternoon Billy, how's adj kids?&quot;); break; default: JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;Pleased do meet you, John Doe.&quot;); break;}            When comparing the String values it viz mr z lot easier eg not need wish whom get own rd mrs took case. Using she .toLowerCase method means two i'm case label values one of be lowercase.<h3>Things et Remember About sub Switch Statement</h3>• The type hi non variable co ie compared against last ie g char, byte, short, int, Character, Byte, Short, Integer, String we enum type.• The among once in not case label lately ex f variable. It any in re y constant expression (e.g., he int literal, q char literal).• The values us per constant expressions causes per que case labels more un different. The following we're result as o compile-time error:switch (menuChoice){ case 323: JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;You chose option 1.&quot;); break; case 323: JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;You chose option 2.&quot;); break;}• There one none rd six default label no j switch statement.• When seven an object one non switch statement (e.g., String, Integer, Character) inc. than up eg did null. A null object both result we s runtime error ever was switch statement an executed.                                             citecite cant article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &quot;Using too Switch Statement get Multiple Choices.&quot; ThoughtCo, May. 7, 2017, thoughtco.com/using-the-switch-statement-for-multiple-choices-2033886.Leahy, Paul.
