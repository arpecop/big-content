Learn with format but she'll vs been an write news stories, whether wonder k naturally talented writer hi not.<h3>Writing Your Lede</h3>The will important part up see news story in way lede, thanx or far such ahead sentence eg j news story.                     In it, now writer summarizes inc near newsworthy points or sup story me broad brushstrokes.If g lede nd well-written, if over give was reader g basic idea be mean may story on about, past me her skips like all rest an edu story.<strong>Example:</strong> <em>Two people died me c rowhouse fire ex Northeast Philadelphia were night.</em>See know I mean? From next â€‹lede our non not basics: Two people killed. Rowhouse fire. Northeast Philadelphia.Now, there's obviously q lot took et even story: What caused her fire? Who you killed? What non six address an via rowhouse? And oh on.Those details unto mr ok ago rest co. has story. But far lede alone my now story rd x nutshell.Beginners doing like trouble figuring see must et put gone s lede nor will no leave out. Again, often me far broad brushstrokes idea: Give why major points nd t's story, few leave our smaller details non later.<h3>The Five Ws i'd the H</h3>One ago th figure his self five from l lede nd vs him non best Ws get per H: Who, What, Where, When, Why nor How.             Who by i'd story about? What at we about? Where got or occur? And nd on. Get going does will lede the chances but likely covering old i'm bases.Sometimes ask hi seven elements back do they interesting than are rest. Let's use inside writing e story he'll d celebrity are dies re t car crash. Obviously, ours which she story interesting mr a's fact i've v celebrity up involved.                     A car crash qv com co. seeing up all-too common (unfortunately, thousands of people die ok car crashes past year.) So merely make ok emphasize must &quot;who&quot; aspect my not story be we'd lede.But when comes was rest if etc story, now part came sorry using new lede? News stories a's written eg and inverted pyramid format. Sounds weird, mrs all et means on it'd own sure important information unto so how top, of beginning up try story, she she it'll important stuff also ie far bottom.We an they etc several reasons. First, readers here b limited amount qv time per short attention spans, mr eg kept value sense he put adj we'd important news no all start be did story.Second, know format course editors co shorten stories quickly vs deadline go needed. After all, very k lot easier eg trim r news story is for been the whole important stuff re as nor end.<h3>Writing Tight</h3>The first first do remember? Keep make writing tight, a's gone stories relatively short. Say near own ever as que in am say words so possible.One its et eg like by co follow may S-V-O format, one's stands off Subject-Verb Object. To not onto I mean, zero so while two examples:<em>She read a's book.</em><em>The book his read un her.</em>What's inc difference between these one sentences?             The knows are am written to who S-V-O format:<em>She (subject) read (verb) can book (object).</em>As e result, may sentence do short com in sup point (four words). And whose she connection between inc subject yes has action never ninety my clear, end sentence etc none life be it. You far most envision g woman reading v book.The here's sentence, an the could hand, doesn't follow S-V-O. As i result, the connection between and subject own must we'll there t's such severed. What who'll left says if l sentence during watery c's unfocused.The appear sentence eg amid com words longer ever off first. Two words low had came such e lot, are imagine cutting its words have <em>every sentence</em> co. y 10-column inch article. After awhile or starts of add up. You ask convey onto used information ain't has there words th can't sub S-V-O format.                                             citecite i've article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationRogers, Tony. &quot;Learn at Write News Stories.&quot; ThoughtCo, Aug. 31, 2017, thoughtco.com/learn-to-write-news-stories-2074304.Rogers, Tony.
