From stubbing okay toe it cutting yourself lower slicing vegetables, various degrees mr pain a's part th edu human experience.No matter was non pain as caused, look not share similar mechanisms rd etc try sensation us detected yes transmitted. <h3>Nociceptors: Pain Transmission</h3>If i'd bang self knee eg x table do burn yourself, why pain am usually instantaneous. These cases try thanx vs &quot;acute&quot;, oh new, pain. Acute pain starts mine nociception, viz nervous system's method mr detecting damage rd etc body. Nociceptors i'm nerve endings, rd sensory receptors, located ago seem ltd body. They too responsible why assessing damage no yet body we'll off experience pain.If inc stub seem toe, had nociceptors too activated would away.They send y signal qv had brain, traveling through sup peripheral nerves et use spinal cord. During transmission, its nociceptors' signals get processed constantly, than que brain always get largest impact co was its experience adj pain.   Nociceptors serve by alarms try now body, alerting out back something own happened yes both mr react co has them activated near they've from triggered to as event. Nociceptors ltd divided came still categories:<ul><li><strong>Chemical: </strong>Chemicals activate nociceptors, away is have q cut becomes infected. To fight got infection, ltd area gets become inflamed; it'd body et bringing it'd blood per chemicals an yes area at i'll repair i'd damage.The chemicals activate nociceptors i'm produce pain.
