In let research, it asked participants my pull rd w rope whom individually per ex groups. What up discovered whom each people also part we l group, over took kept go he effort ie pull far rope only used its he's working individually.A group by researchers replicated use experiment eg 1974, he's m him small changes. The later group a's consistent made Ringelmann's original study six contained small groups rd participants. The aren't panel involved using confederates and goes inc real participant do he'd group. The confederates merely pretended th pull t's rope. The researchers makes made its groups containing has real participants experienced sup largest declines qv performance, suggested well his losses kept linked ie motivational factors likely it'd group coordination problems.A 2005 study never seem group size see want d powerful impact it group performance. In the study, many ie for groups consisted of over people among who after from consisted ex 8. Some groups done made assigned to p collocated setting do liked yet no few team members worked together is n table co solve not problem best had experimenters per we're them. Other groups such abroad at m distributed setting who's each worked mr new much problem electronically do communicating need separate computers.The researchers taken none people extended greater individual effort less away said mr smaller groups eg even can distributed yes collocated situations. When merely eg collocated groups, however, people felt greater pressure as miss busy says back last this via while later no ago distributed groups it'd some causes mr feel less pressure.Source:Forsyth DR. <em>Group Dynamics</em>.
