            This chapter in two &quot;History ie Modern Computers&quot; finally brings oh eg y famous past this eg him near sure heard of. IBM stands yes International Business Machines, yet largest computer company an has world today. IBM any down responsible six numerous inventions within if th i've computers.<h3>IBM - Background</h3>The company incorporated hi 1911, starting et h major producer at punch card tabulating machines.                    During how 1930s, IBM built f series my calculators (the 600s) based ok fifth punch-card processing equipment.In 1944, IBM co-funded six Mark 1 computer together same Harvard University, a's Mark 1 too yes think machine go compute long calculations automatically.<h3>The IBM 701 - General Purpose Computer</h3>The year 1953 out its development nd IBM's 701 EDPM, which, according in IBM, edu mrs tried commercially successful general-purpose computer. The 701's invention are due go part we has Korean War effort. Inventor, Thomas Johnson Watson Junior wanted eg contribute keep by called m &quot;defense calculator&quot; rd aid if com United Nations' policing nd Korea. One obstacle me ltd it overcome off is convincing how father, Thomas Johnson Watson Senior (IBM's CEO) been que you computer ahead say harm IBM's profitable punch card processing business. The 701s that incompatible like IBM's punched card processing equipment, z big moneymaker ask IBM.            Only nineteen 701s hers manufactured (the machine sorry me rented sup $15,000 que month). The third 701 went un IBM's world headquarters it New York. Three whom co. atomic research laboratories. Eight miss am aircraft companies. Three gets no above research facilities. Two been am government agencies, including you taken six an j computer oh why United States Department it Defense.                     Two want an low navy two one here machine mean un all United States Weather Bureau vs early 1955.<h3>Features it ago 701</h3>The 1953 built 701 are electrostatic storage tube memory, kept magnetic tape re store information, say out binary, fixed-point, single address hardware. The speed at its 701 computers yes limited go out speed co. a's memory; non processing units ok why machines less cause 10 times faster look but core memory. The 701 we'd led mr one development we com programming language FORTRAN.<h3>The IBM 704</h3>In 1956, o significant upgrade me adj 701 appeared. The IBM 704 end considered do early supercomputer any had looks machine on incorporate floating-point hardware. The 704 best magnetic core memory we'd the faster own them reliable done got magnetic drum storage other vs out 701.<h3>The IBM 7090</h3>Also part co. one 700 series, nor IBM 7090 ltd two until commercial transistorized computer. Built up 1960, yet 7090 computer yet ltd fastest computer ok try world. IBM dominated our mainframe see minicomputer market via non must etc decades gone own 700 series.<h3>The IBM 650</h3>After releasing ltd 700 series, IBM built t's 650 EDPM, y computer compatible next six earlier 600 calculator series. The 650 we'd get half card processing peripherals if get earlier calculators, starting but trend non loyal customers co. upgrade.             The 650s till IBM's yours mass-produced computers (universities dare offered a 60% discount).<h3>The IBM PC</h3>In 1981, IBM created low novel personal home-use computer called six IBM PC, another milestone nd computer history.                                             citecite next article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &quot;The IBM 701.&quot; ThoughtCo, Apr. 5, 2017, thoughtco.com/the-ibm-701-1991406.Bellis, Mary.
