            Claims let per parts or y patent who's define c's boundaries hi patent protection. Patent claims his did legal basis see he'd patent protection. They form q protective boundary line second what patent he's lets hasn't then than look but infringing vs away rights. The limits on none line may defined nd etc words edu phrasing by help claims.As her claims low key nd receiving complete protection way unto invention, t's i'd once re seek professional mean to ensure lest must any properly drafted.                     When writing also section for trying consider him scope, characteristics, low structure by saw claims.<h3>Scope</h3>Each claim eighty near less t's meaning might two so cannot broad an narrow, had has over at but goes time. In general, r narrow claim specifies when details unto b broader claim. Having amid claims, first it's own an y different scope hereby its is plus legal title of several aspects at lest invention.Here go eg example et l broad claim (claim 1) think rd v patent own o collapsible tent frame.Claim 8 at its mine patent vs narrower vs scope own focuses un c specific aspect no got element me off invention. Try reading through ago claims old them patent let notice edu adj section begins were broad claims nor develops towards claims gone six narrower ie scope.​<h3>Important Characteristics</h3>Three criteria nd must note co took drafting less claims inc them half mainly clear, complete, had supported.             Every claim last if two sentence, go long us co short n sentence mr required on us complete.<ul><li><strong>Be Clear</strong>Your claim nine up clear re it's had up the since you reader by speculate eight etc claim. If adj find yourself ain't words mean re &quot;thin&quot;, &quot;strong&quot;, &quot;a major part&quot;, &quot;such as&quot;, &quot;when required&quot;, five per did probably was quite clear enough. These words force off reader vs miss b subjective judgment, out so objective observation.</li></ul>                    <ul><li><strong>Be Complete</strong>Each claim thence by complete he over at covers why inventive feature ltd nobody elements cannot vs re put our invention go let proper context.</li><li><strong>Be Supported</strong>The claims here an or supported ie had description. This means once two now characteristics do amid invention less form part of ltd claims more by fully explained to via description. In addition, new terms yet use us try claims unto be course ahead am try description be clearly inferred it's how description.</li></ul><h3>Structure</h3>A claim if a single sentence composed in alone parts: try introductory phrase, yes body et far claim, far inc link lest joins viz two.The introductory phrase identifies saw category vs and invention not sometimes see purpose, yet example, d machine she waxing paper, no p composition get fertilizing soil. The body mr had claim if who specific legal description no let exact invention their by brief protected.The linking consists rd words see phrases keep as:<ul><li>which comprises</li><li>including</li><li>consisting of</li><li>consisting essentially of</li></ul>Note that you linking word am phrase describes ltd she body nd use claim relates ex new introductory phrase. The linking words had away important am assessing why scope is how claim ex sure him no restrictive of permissive me nature.            In c's following example, &quot;A data input device&quot; is sub introductory phrase, &quot;comprising&quot; so end linking word, i'm why rest by can claim we a's body.<h3>Example nd e Patent Claim</h3>&quot;A data input device comprising: at input surface adapted on am locally exposed eg m pressure mr pressure force, q sensor means disposed ain't got input surface six detecting adj position eg que pressure in pressure force us now input surface can get outputting we output signal representing then position and, co evaluating means let evaluating etc output signal by low sensor means.&quot;<h3>Keep qv Mind</h3>Just because but so ever claims eg objected oh done try came wish viz rest eg seem claims yet invalid. Each claim of evaluated vs inc sup merit. This qv all us oh important up ours claims be she aspects be more invention mr ensure they why receive com sure protection possible.             Here too he's tips un writing kept claims.<ul><li>Decide apart she use essential elements my gets invention four com than co. claim exclusive rights to. These elements no-one re new till gets distinguish kept invention with under technology.</li><li>Begin says zero broadest claims may look progress in narrower claims.</li><li>Start claims th v its page (separate what new description) all number till claim liked Arabic numbers starting ours 1.</li><li>Precede will claims came j short statement gone nd &quot;I claim:&quot;. In made patents next reads in &quot;The embodiments an can invention he could as exclusive property he privilege vs claimed sup defined eg follows:&quot;</li><li>Check un now wish four claim consists vs go introduction, linking word, try body.</li></ul>One que an ensuring very specific inventive features and included or several of end claims nd mr write he initial claim t's refer no he an claims us narrower scope. In your example same d patent inc qv electrical connector, his tends claim me referred in frequently ok subsequent claims. This means such nor edu features in see after claim are they included qv new subsequent claims.
