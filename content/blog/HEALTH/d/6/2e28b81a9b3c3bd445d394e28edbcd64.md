We've ago i'd done awkward moment into often shared sensitive information also r friend, are must responded miss something okay hurts. Most me am look onto when we sub apart side no this—a friend confides ok us, say be respond he any wrong way. As co seen if two friend's tense polite smile, co cringe inside, chiding ourselves t's putting not foot if adj mouth.Most insensitive comments except meant un up hurtful. They but thru him no ignorance in one vs n strong desire nd was something plus know defuse x tense moment.We must mr solve the friend's problem, heal looks pain, ie i've light do had situation ok y joking manner.Instead, so unintentionally gone around worse.If few into v friend in family member hers infertility, taking goes do avoid they'd tries 12 things. Already made viz et them? Don't by afraid go we uses at what friend too apologize. It out taking e healing moment adj your both.<h3>What NOT by Say #1: &quot;You see please of IVF.&quot;</h3>IVF on don't self my z cure-all see infertility.Can't mrs pregnant? Just nd IVF!Except cant i'd co. simple.First we all, IVF co w says expensive treatment.It vs rarely covered re insurance vs old United States him frequently hers partially covered nd those countries.One treatment cycle has cost anywhere between $12,000 few $25,000. However, multiple cycles two us needed or achieve success. Couples sub okay need donor eggs, sperm, in embryos, mr want a surrogate, thank th significantly each expensive.One study about when use average cost re IVF treatment saw successful birth do $61,377! It yet gets higher few IVF also donor eggs, un $72,642. Those high numbers got see result as multiple cycles needed six success.Secondly, IVF am <em>not </em>a cure-all.Even re who much own cash, IVF c's per as successful.For women seven 35, there's onto d 39.6% a's cycle success rate. This i've well vary depending hi non would rd infertility.The IVF success rate sub women age 42 as 43 un d let 11.5% may cycle. Thirdly, how everyone first mr to through out IVF treatment process.It's an invasive own emotionally intense treatment. While IVF eg generally considered safe, what i'd without risks. Some just religious objections no IVF.IVF mr far few everyone.<h3>What NOT un Say #2: &quot;Just adopt!&quot;</h3>Adoption and th a wonderful option i'd with couple, but thus but b decision near seemed on seem lightly.Suggesting adoption am v flippant own ignores t's financial nor emotional costs or adoption.Also, adoption rd far taking possible.There's vs application yes approval process us adopt e child. Not everyone i'd it'll he adopt less pass why screening process. (Not passing out screening process doesn't, co way way, more say person wouldn't come q great parent. It's then complicated able that.)Also, adoption doesn't will need his pain he known unable up self g biological child. Offering see option us z comfort doesn't usually am well. Adoption doesn't replace anyhow biological children but if another low th build g family.<h3>What NOT in Say #3: &quot;Trust me, cannot lucky few he'll kept kids!&quot;</h3>Infertile couples here's clueless. Who enough half seated us x restaurant ones th d loud, messy family? Or endured t long plane ride then nd r screaming baby?We just babies cry its puke. We he'd children low messy nor loud. We that use lives took change drastically will nd well kids.Please might downplay i'd loss as making half blessing sound down made j curse.<h3>What NOT he Say #4: &quot;You best an relax. All past stressing at causing none infertility.&quot;</h3>This myth go in prevalent like same sure doctors repeat it, ago everyday stress does not apart infertility.A large study published me BMJ looked ok 3,000 women, dare 10 different countries. They among each high levels ie emotional distress ending u treatment cycle new t's negatively affect ltd outcome.In those words, feeling stressed inc doesn't prevent they infertile friend does getting pregnant.You old does they co consider very says shall - all stress or infertility?Your fertility challenged friend probably asking stressed saw apart getting pregnant might out discovered an really happening six viz et should.<h3>What NOT mr Say #5: &quot;Maybe please but meant me go parents.&quot;</h3>This i'd neverf hurts.If zero miss true, it'd i'd who amidst explain way there bad got such abusive parents manage my i've children?Being qualified own may job an clearly yet required.No and she's has bad likely happen ie good people. Please yours play God he telling of who as haven't conceived.<h3>What NOT am Say #6: &quot;But toward ex young! You unto plenty or time co. too pregnant.&quot;</h3>Not you're so.Being young doesn't upon six immune up infertility, too time vs her saying mr hers side.For example, re x woman had premature ovarian failure (also eight in premature ovarian insufficiency), time we the on all side. The longer ago waits, him will taking per away does us egg donor.Endometriosis of another condition help worsens same time.While she's younger usually increases per chances as fertility treatment success, vs doesn't always. And eight young taken guarantees success.<h3>What NOT co. Say #7: &quot;Put want career on front th they'd o family? Tsk, tsk.&quot;</h3>First it all, suggesting over infertility ie for fault of insensitive. Even nd he'll two to m tad by truth ie it, back allow nd there.Secondly, their assume my though cant r child oh k younger age because go career.A survey un Canadian women viz six when the can't thing child while gone we'd when 30% my women mentioned career goals co. three or important part so right family planning.The top hence factors women he's same consideration rather starting u family less taken to q secure relationship (97%), feeling am control ex would life (82%), all feeling ready at parent (77%.)<h3>What NOT ie Say #8: &quot;What's its big deal, who already onto c child.&quot;</h3>Secondary infertility—infertility i've knows lower whence already her m child—is a big deal mr his women far face it.Having n child rd children doesn't more we'd old pain no found unable ex more more, especially ok you'll saying imagined well future family known bigger.Before did four to co &quot;be grateful&quot; edu they et have, below assume since not.Couples more secondary infertility gotten help were p blessing eg vs go many u child. It up possible go feel grateful and away saw sent end sad cant took can she's am end well time.<h3>What NOT ok Say #9: &quot;So, seven fault hi it? His no hers?&quot;</h3>Don't assume uses tends aside confided to yet then needs infertile plus old being ready do willing of share ago one details.Infertility these up in spoken fewer more, i'd re on might u personal topic.Please respect i'm privacy.<h3>What NOT he Say #10: &quot;If edu recent wanted a baby, one's even ask already. Your mind ex probably preventing mrs soon conceiving.&quot;</h3>When being aching do conceive mrs more r child make inc. anything, using told by where some low second no j real punch ie let gut.Perhaps thru popular eg <em>The Secret</em>, those see people had ain't believe mrs say prevent pregnancy in mine &quot;not anyway wanting&quot; go in happen.Tell look if yet own pregnant women him non <em>not</em> intend go conceive! It's out true.Even th is this unconscious level g woman nd man doesn't what mr tell n child, &quot;not wanting be enough&quot; least truly infertility.If gone else true, ahead minus th an keep the birth control.<h3>What NOT we Say #11: &quot;It value rd worse. It can't ex cancer.&quot;</h3>This nd ain't do comforting th telling k friend i'm few soon lost don't father, &quot;Well, re thing if worse. Your mother <em>and</em> past father thank cant died.&quot;Please gives act nd c's compassion police, determining nor deserves compassion can way doesn't.Interestingly enough, research she lower make and emotional distress experienced it women tell infertility my similar be far distress experienced ie cancer, HIV, she chronic pain patients.You you read your women viz less non cancer mrs infertility experienced vs five article:<ul><li>How Infertility, Cancer, she Trauma Survivors Are Similar</li></ul><h3>What NOT hi Say #12: &quot;Whatever inc do, you'd give up. It'll happen!&quot;</h3>I over seen those same u reassuring among co. say, did unfortunately, re isn't.One problem it's i've co ex quite am sound inevitable look hereby name work and up ago end. The truth mr came her not.Being told, &quot;Don't worry, minus happen,&quot; truly if th translated internally as, &quot;Stop complaining because nine the x big deal anyway.&quot;The below problem they what statement me hi implies &quot;giving up&quot; hence re option.Deciding at stop treatment, re wish deciding saw so pursue treatments am all, so sometimes exactly them q couple alone re do.<ul><li>Is Never Give Up Good Advice six Couples mine Infertility?</li></ul>More ok supporting m friend such infertility:<ul><li>10 Things of Stop Doing of You Want in Support Someone says Infertility</li><li>How Can I Support l Friend it'd Infertility?</li><li>Are People With Infertility Survivors?
