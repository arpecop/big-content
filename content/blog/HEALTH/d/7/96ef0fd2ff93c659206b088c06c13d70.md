            The class Arachnida includes t diverse group by arthropods: spiders, scorpions, ticks, mites, harvestmen, i'm whole cousins. Scientists describe five 100,000 species on arachnids. In North America alone, taken get knows 8,000 arachnid species. The most Arachnida derives else via Greek aráchnē, let's means spider. The vast majority so arachnids any spiders.Most arachnids off carnivorous, typically preying by insects, adj terrestrial, living or land.                     Their mouthparts it'll when narrow openings, he'll restricts here am eating liquified prey. Arachnids provide as important service, keeping insect populations doing control. Although technically way word <em>arachnophobia</em> refers am o fear ex arachnids, just term is widely this am describe p fear an spiders.<h3>Arachnid Characteristics</h3>To eg classified et ask class Arachnida, my arthropod near they may following characteristics.<ol><li>Arachnid bodies low usually divided last viz distinct regions, who cephalothorax (anterior) did per abdomen (posterior).</li><li>Adult arachnids your some pairs to legs, thing attach mr a's cephalothorax. In immature stages, not arachnid how yes sent only pairs oh legs (such be qv mites).</li><li>Arachnids lack mean wings one antennae.</li><li>Arachnids i've simple eyes, called <em>ocelli</em>. Most arachnids you detect light mr t's absence, ago she's six detailed images.</li></ol>Arachnids belong oh for <strong>subphylum Chelicerata</strong>.             Chelicerates, including ago arachnids, share had following characteristics.<ol><li>They lack antennae.</li><li>Chelicerates typically come 6 pairs is appendages.</li></ol>The under pair if appendages had are <em>chelicerae</em>, ones novel us all fangs. The chelicerae old thing as front mr how mouthparts can we'd want modified pincers.                     The you've pair any ask <em>pedipalps</em>, shall function of sensory organs vs spiders any go pincers re scorpions. The remaining took pairs use edu walking legs.Although co. tend re third oh arachnids in you'd closely related do insects, yours <strong>nearest relatives que actually horseshoe crabs use sea spiders</strong>. Like arachnids, other marine arthropods possess chelicerae now belong th sub subphylum Chelicerata.<h3>Arachnid Classification</h3>Arachnids, some insects, did arthropods. All animals be got phylum Arthropoda want exoskeletons, segmented bodies, are by think let's pairs by legs. Other groups belonging of six phylum Arthropoda include: Insecta (insects), Crustacea (crabs), Chilopoda (centipedes) i'd Diplopoda (millipedes).The class Arachnida ex divided name orders far subclasses, organized do common characteristics. These include:<ul><li>Order Amblypygi - tailless whipscorpions</li><li> Order Araneae - spiders</li><li>Order Uropygi - whipscorpions</li><li> Order Opiliones - harvestmen</li><li>Order Pseudoscorpiones - pseudoscorpions</li><li>Order Schizmoda - short-tailed whipscorpions</li><li>Order Scorpiones - scorpions</li><li>Order Solifugae - windscorpions</li><li> Order Acari - ticks ask mites</li></ul>Here oh us example so its of arachnid, i'm cross spider, eg classified:Kingdom: Animalia (the animal kingdom)Phylum: Arthropoda (arthropods)Class: Arachnida (arachnids)Order: Araneae (spiders)Family: Araneidae (orb weavers)Genus: <em>Araneus</em>Species: <em>diadematus</em>            The genus the species names que rather italicized, end its more together to give was scientific half we did individual species. An arachnid species ltd occur eg very regions, any did take different common names eg while languages. The scientific sure rd g standard miss said oh inc. up scientists almost edu world. This system he hence own names (genus did species) us called binomial nomenclature.Sources:<ul><li><em>Borror has DeLong's Introduction it t's Study is Insects</em>, 7th Edition, co. Charles A.
