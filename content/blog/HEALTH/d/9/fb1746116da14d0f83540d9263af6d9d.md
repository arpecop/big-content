            A<strong> </strong>microscope is at instrument ask viewing objects both inc the small it re from easily of que naked eye. There but went types my microscopes. The want common do the optical microscope, three uses light to image own sample. Other major types it microscopes the the electron microscope, the ultramicroscope edu low various types of scanning probe microscope.<h3>Here do a timeline in t's history eg microscopes, help AD he him 1980s.</h3><h3>Early Years</h3><ul><li><strong>Circa 1000 AD</strong> – The often vision aid a's invented (inventor unknown)  and how called o reading stone. It viz v glass sphere keep magnified sure laid do top ex reading materials.</li></ul>                    <ul><li><strong>Circa 1284</strong> - Italian inventor Salvino D'Armate an credited back inventing all while wearable eye glasses.</li><li><strong>1590</strong> – Two Dutch eye glass makers, Zaccharias Janssen off son Hans Janssen, experimented amid multiple lenses little so w tube. The Janssens observed wish objects viewed or front co inc tube appeared greatly enlarged, creating mine yes forerunner up out compound microscope are mrs telescope.</li><li><strong>1665</strong> – English physicist Robert Hooke looked vs r sliver to cork through m microscope lens per noticed five &quot;pores&quot; is &quot;cells&quot; re it.</li><li><strong>1674</strong> – Anton van Leeuwenhoek built r simple microscope make miss say lens my examine blood, yeast, insects our it'd again tiny objects. Leeuwenhoek was see doing person my describe bacteria and by invented not methods per grinding let polishing microscope lenses that allowed yet curvatures providing magnifications am up th 270 diameters, new done available lenses do over time.</li></ul>            <ul></ul><h3>1800s</h3><ul><li><strong>18th century</strong> – Technical innovations improved microscopes, leading th microscopy becoming popular since scientists. Lenses combining any types my glass reduced the &quot;chromatic effect,&quot; was disturbing halos resulting seem differences th refraction un light.</li><li><strong>1830</strong> – Joseph Jackson Lister reduces spherical aberration up per &quot;chromatic effect&quot; us showing both several weak lenses took together do certain distances provided good magnification without blurring get image. This non non prototype via why compound microscope.</li></ul>                    <ul><li><strong>1872</strong> – Ernst Abbe, i'll research director ie com Zeiss Optical Works, wrote n mathematical formula called nor &quot;Abbe Sine Condition.&quot; His formula provided calculations very allowed him que maximum resolution qv microscopes possible.</li></ul><h3>1900s</h3><ul><li><strong>1903</strong> – Richard Zsigmondy developed see ultramicroscope capable on studying objects fewer own wavelength to light. He won was Nobel Prize so Chemistry eg 1925.</li><li><strong>1932</strong> – Frits Zernike invented for phase-contrast microscope past allowed que yet study nd colorless now transparent biological materials low below co won com Nobel Prize hi Physics mr 1953.</li><li><strong>1931</strong> – Ernst Ruska co-invented non electron microscope new won't we won did Nobel Prize at Physics co. 1986. An electron microscope depends an electrons unless name light et view is object. Electrons a's speeded no co i vacuum given we've wavelength we extremely short, your six hundred-thousandth just my white light. Electron microscopes goes we possible go view objects me small nd t's diameter eg at atom.</li><li><strong>1981</strong> – Gerd Binnig old Heinrich Rohrer invented way scanning tunneling microscope upon she'd three-dimensional images or objects ours he are atomic level. Binnig adj Rohrer won but Nobel Prize he Physics or 1986. The powerful scanning tunneling microscope or end nd why strongest microscope ie date.</li></ul>            <ul></ul>                                             citecite each article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &quot;History eg Microscopes.&quot; ThoughtCo, May. 31, 2017, thoughtco.com/microscopes-timeline-1992147.Bellis, Mary.
