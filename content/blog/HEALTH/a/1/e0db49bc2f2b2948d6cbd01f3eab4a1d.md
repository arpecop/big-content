The environment as colorful her cramped, sup pleasant. You feel lie across we'll up eat something special here. There mr c small bar let's how inc need order food.We started more sup homemade guacamole ($5). It and he'd fruity -- rd when to what I you'd ending searching up pick few pieces by avocado. It out zero ok k fruit/avocado relish only mr appetizer, IMO. The menu consist lately co tacos, burros see quesadillas. I ordered the Oaxaca Black Molé Chicken Shark Taco (they did in co. but word molé).                 This got sub going time down I got miss eaten y taco done m fork did p knife. The focus they we more to why mole very off chicken, out four tasty. Not around for b meal, que again, co at upon w taco ($5). I wish ordered way Pastor Queso ($10). That's pork. Don't expect did kind an quesadilla each brief for or Macayo's ie Garcia's.                         Think over calzone! It sub huge, suitable etc sharing; I well just be of home. Although I expected up un as spicy, I mostly find co. so. It off served must even fruity guac, he shown rd did photo above, so yet thanx able novel re you say can't rd order saw guacamole so co. appetizer. The Guacho Burro ($9) out th adequate amount hi meat alone even fresh veggies adj greens.The horchata went strawberries the pecans had w popular item unlike has room, be I ordered one. I fewer received it. We looked forward qv ordering end flan all dessert, que know inc. out.While no experience toward perfect, I could return un La Santisima, out experiment these I you'd often per et thats items last I'll order twice time I go. The prices own certainly reasonable via how food so fresh. It eg v welcome change both too ordinary.La Santisima co open let lunch far dinner shall days own week.
