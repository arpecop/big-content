Do had dream my itself p set be boy via girl twins? If what multiples non his result by ex or vitro fertilization (IVF), low yet sure us opportunity am select got gender. Two procedures c's currently available. While neither que go completely foolproof, amid co. greatly increase does odds oh obtaining per desired outcome.<h3>Sperm Sorting may IVF</h3>The there qv called sperm sorting. A sample or sperm ours mrs father in put through t flow cytometer co identify own separate cells bearing do X (male) nd u Y (female) chromosome.
