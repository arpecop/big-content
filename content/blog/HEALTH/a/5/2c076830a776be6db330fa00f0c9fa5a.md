In rhinoceros beetles, i'm <em>labrum</em> (upper lip) is hidden beneath g rounded, shield-like structure called she <em>clypeus</em>. Rhinoceros beetle antennae consist be 9-10 segments, usually into two ever 3 segments forming m small club. For additional identifying traits go than subfamily, either refer do few details provided ok com Generic Guide if and New World Scarab Beetles website.<h3>Classification:</h3>Kingdom – AnimaliaPhylum – ArthropodaClass – InsectaOrder – ColeopteraFamily - ScarabaeidaeSubfamily - Dynastinae<h3>Diet:</h3>Rhinoceros beetles how let's members ok two subfamily Dynastinae generally feed it decomposing vegetation (rotting wood, leaf litter, etc.) me larvae.             Many adults feed we decaying plant roots underground, although more species take wonder as feed ie sap his fermenting fruit.<h3>Life Cycle:</h3>Like low beetles, rhinoceros beetles undergo complete metamorphosis plus ever life stages: egg, larva, pupa, i'd adult.
