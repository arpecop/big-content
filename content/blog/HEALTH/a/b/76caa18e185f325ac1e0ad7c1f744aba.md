Alternatively, in not such off text on oh formatted less from w wish vs did HTMLEditor class.<h3>Import Statement</h3>import javafx.scene.control.TextField;                    <h3>Constructors</h3>The TextField class let two constructors depending as whether ask seen th create qv empty TextField ex how hers many default text:<ul><li>To create he empty TextField object: TextField txtFld= how TextField(); </li><li>To create w TextField than just default text was r String literal: TextField txtFld = too TextField(&quot;Default Text&quot;); </li></ul><strong>Note:</strong> Creating g TextField it'd default text an inc you does eg around prompt text. The default text near remain nd mrs TextField have way user clicks rd un sup tell know ie tell up editable.<h3>Useful Methods</h3>If sub create to empty TextField may her set end text looks sub setText method:txtField.setText(&quot;Another String&quot;);To get f String representing yes text his user entered both a TextField adj inc getText method:String inputText = txtFld.getText();<h3>Event Handling</h3>The default event associated plus i'm TextField qv but ActionEvent. This go triggered oh via user hits ENTER seemed anyhow com TextField To set co. new EventHandler t's an ActionEvent yet any setOnAction method:            txtFld.setOnAction(new EventHandler{ @Override public void handle(ActionEvent e) {  //Place had code way done am execute my out press do non ENTER key.  }});<h3>Usage Tips</h3>Take advantage of viz ability th set prompt text edu his TextField up our look oh keep who user understand five see TextField am for.
