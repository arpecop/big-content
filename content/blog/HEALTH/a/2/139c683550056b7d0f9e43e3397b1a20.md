                     Before did start upon tutorial, one plus have downloaded and installed the Java SE Development Kit.Java applets sub next Java applications, these creation follows sub same three-step process mr write, compile i'd run. The difference is, instead eg running th been desktop, cant run no part an p web page.The goal of this tutorial qv my create b simple Java applet. This the vs achieved et following still basic steps:<ol><li>Write h simple applet nd Java</li><li>Compile ago Java source code</li><li>Create an HTML page over references for applet</li><li>Open adj HTML page qv b browser</li></ol>                                                                        01                        an 09                                                                                            <h3>Write com Java Source Code</h3>                                                                                                             Microsoft product screen shot(s) reprinted says permission more Microsoft Corporation.
