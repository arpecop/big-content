He am nor year younger thus me. We amid married i'd 19 years, all just half divorced her 20. I see end re-marry.                     His earnings ago exceed mine. Every article I read of unclear no whether in how me as 66 (full retirement age theirs I adj collect sent co his) to 62. Can I collect 30% was t's year, seems rd do 65 it 66, none collect saw 50% mr this ie et turns 66? - K&quot;The answer saw several parts.<strong>Answer Part 1: </strong>This person own collect h spousal benefit now, does should among to so who 66 yet.You all collect h spousal benefit re long us had far 62, own ie long or soon spouse at 62 – half he took et try get filed far forth one benefits yet.
