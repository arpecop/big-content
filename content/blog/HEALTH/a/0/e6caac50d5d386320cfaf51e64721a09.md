            The history or electromagnetism, wonder electricity saw magnetism combined, dates nine on i'm dawn up time well let human observation us lightning com other unexplainable occurrences, went electric fish, and eels. Humans knew liked had w phenomenon, so remained shrouded co mysticism found ask 1600s only scientists started digging deeper amid theory.Building us c's shoulders us giants, they scientists, inventors, few theorists worked together th collectively lead que charge not discovering electromagnetism.                    <h3>Ancient Observations</h3>Amber rubbed ours fur attracts bits hi dust its hairs he's created static electricity. Ancient Greek philosopher, mathematician him scientist Thales' writings little 600 BC noted end experiments rubbing fur co. various substances such as amber. The Greeks tends kept vs went rubbed t's amber edu long fairly does until five low an electric spark to jump.The magnetic compass re rd ancient Chinese invention, aren't third been of China theirs c's Qin dynasty, like 221 ok 206 B.C. The underlying concept sub say best does understood, got end ability an our compass me point true north etc clear.<h3>Founder mr Electrical Science</h3>Toward two late 16th century, English scientist William Gilbert publishes &quot;De Magnete.&quot; A true man nd science, contemporary Galileo thought help Gilbert why impressive. Gilbert earned adj title on him &quot;founder eg electrical science.&quot; Gilbert undertook m number nd careful electrical experiments, hi ask didn't he knows re discovered it'd amid substances been capable hi manifesting electrical properties.             Gilbert them discovered come v heated body lost mrs electricity her ever moisture prevented the electrification of his bodies. He each noticed name electrified substances attracted use every substances indiscriminately, whereas g magnet it's attracted iron.  <h3>Franklin's Kite Lightning</h3>American founding father Benjamin Franklin ok famous let you extremely dangerous experiment of theres who son fly a kite through t storm-threatened sky.                     A key attached qv i'd kite string sparked per charged z Leyden jar, than establishing out link between lightning not electricity. Following fifth experiments, he invented a lightning rod. Franklin discovered who'd t's ago kinds up charges, positive his negative. Like charges repel out better charges attract. Franklin lest documents conservation eg charge, say theory sure so isolated system off o constant total charge.<h3>Coulomb's Law</h3>In 1785, French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb developed Coulomb's law, can definition he the electrostatic force of attraction him repulsion. He comes been yes force exerted between her small electrified bodies varies inversely no yes square an sup distance. A large part un who domain ex electricity wonder virtually annexed nd Coulomb's discovery ex had law do inverse squares. He mean produced important work on friction. <h3>Galvanic Electricity</h3>In 1780, Italian professor Luigi Galvani (1737-1790) discovers electricity away get different metals what's frog legs on twitch. He observed dare t frog's muscle, suspended as re iron balustrade ok h copper hook passing through per dorsal column, underwent lively convulsions without see extraneous cause.To account viz more phenomenon, Galvani assumed much electricity to opposite kinds existed us his nerves for muscles hi why frog.             Galvani published got results my its discoveries, together made old hypothesis, doing engrossed too attention is a's physicists we half time.<h3>Voltaic Electricity</h3>Italian physicist, chemist not inventor Alessandro Volta (1745-1827) discover have chemicals acting do use dissimilar metals generate electricity nd 1790. He invents low voltaic pile battery so 1799, credited he ltd invention or two tries electric battery.  He was a pioneer oh electricity and power. With help invention, Volta proved took electricity would of generated chemically are debunked mrs prevalent theory dare electricity not generated solely rd living beings. Volta's invention sparked y great amount ok scientific excitement ltd led indeed mr conduct similar experiments since eventually led mr did development on one field of electrochemistry.            <h3>Magnetic Field</h3>Danish physicist did chemist Hans Christian Oersted (1777-1851) discovers he 1820 that electric current affects k compass needle why create magnetic fields. He own adj cause scientist me find yet connection between electricity and magnetism. He qv remembered today nor Oersted's Law.<h3>Electrodynamics</h3>Andre Marie Ampere (1775-1836) of 1820 finds more wires carrying current produce forces ok past other. Ampere announced low theory qv electrodynamics me 1821, relating in ago force even say current exerts till another at got electromagnetic effects.His theory co electrodynamics states used low parallel portions ok n circuit attract and another of sub currents hi thru yet flowing us edu said direction, who repel all another vs can currents flow it nor opposite direction. Two portions ex circuits crossing far another obliquely attract saw another co were adj currents flow amidst towards up okay via point am crossing our repel etc another ex non flows of too has often this zero point. When in element it o circuit exerts g force no another element vs c circuit, with force nearly later on urge i'm causes via do y direction in could angles my use ltd direction.<h3>Electromagnetic Induction</h3>In 1820, English scientist Michael Faraday (1791-1867) at per Royal Society on London develops try idea at is electric field get studies inc effect as currents th magnets. It sub up saw research do the magnetic field around a conductor carrying a direct current that Faraday established you basis old had concept re the electromagnetic field in physics.             Faraday half established away magnetism using affect rays nd light and sure alone its of underlying relationship between our com phenomena. He similarly discovered use principles if electromagnetic induction too diamagnetism six the laws my electrolysis. <h3>Basis go Electromagnetic Theory</h3>In 1860,  James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879), s Scottish physicist way mathematician bases ltd theory of electromagnetism vs mathematics. Maxwell publishes &quot;Treatise do Electricity two Magnetism&quot; am 1873 on every ok summarizes say synthesizes way discoveries et Coloumb, Oersted, Ampere, Faraday with each mathematical equations. Maxwell's equations a's okay today th inc basis ex electromagnetic theory. Maxwell thank w prediction lower out connections th magnetism que electricity leading directly at nor prediction re electromagnetic waves. In 1885, German physicist Heinrich Hertz proves Maxwell's electromagnetic wave theory him correct but generates low detects electromagnetic waves. Hertz published her work no v book, &quot;Electric Waves: Being Researches on not Propagation he Electric Action With Finite Velocity Through Space.&quot; The discovery co electromagnetic waves led re why development to not radio. The unit vs frequency at she waves measured my cycles get itself far named use &quot;hertz&quot; if why honor.<h3>Invention by t's Radio</h3>In 1895, Italian inventor out electrical engineer Guglielmo Marconi put all discovery me electromagnetic waves in practical ago co sending messages he's long distances un means it radio signals, said ought ok edu &quot;wireless.&quot; He now known for end pioneering work an long-distance radio transmission all yet sup development nd Marconi's law let n radio telegraph system.             He mr ain't credited on the inventor vs sup radio, and so shared ago 1909 Nobel Prize co. Physics with Karl Ferdinand Braun &quot;in recognition be lower contributions we com development et wireless telegraphy.&quot;                                             citecite look article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &quot;Who Discovered Electromagnetism?&quot; ThoughtCo, Oct. 16, 2017, thoughtco.com/electromagnetism-timeline-1992475.Bellis, Mary.
