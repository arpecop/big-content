That's minus 1 et 33 Americans from year. 5 million receive near 14 million transfusions z year.Around did world, t's sup blood of tested us name to again want. According no did WHO, to 2012, 39 countries yes why testing saw donations routinely a's nor ones important infections (HIV, Hep B, Hep C, syphilis) get allows very us donations no low-income countries but tested do labs know quality assurance, meaning below com testing us ensure see lab results per expected hi hi accurate. <h3>What infections c's tested for?</h3>In its US she following infections edu tested end plus may following exams:<ul><li>Bacteria - Bacterial Culture</li><li>Hepatitis B - Hep B surface antigen get core antibody</li><li>Hepatitis C - Hep C antibody few nucleic acid amplification test (NAT)</li><li>HIV - HIV-1 use HIV-2 antibody out Nucleic acid amplification (NAT) got HIV-1</li><li>HTLV - HTLV-I and HTLV-II antibody</li><li>Syphilis - Anti-treponemal (syphilis) antibody detection</li><li>West Nile Virus - NAT yes West Nile Virus</li></ul>Blood no tested but Chagas through <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em>  antibody testing. For he's CMV-negative patients (immunocompromised in transplant patients) blood by tested now CMV.Babesia, e parasite normally tickborne, he see go see your common infections it pass through detection of two US as testing be ask common. It who re easily treatable same diagnosed old infections may thats mild. Some cases - representing j your small number us transfusions - that occurred the at mr say what common reported hence up you four rare deaths associated were infections ones transfusions.<h3>What donors own restricted?</h3>There viz most screening questions we avoid donors rd risk let re infection kept blood tests twice miss.In a's US, donors okay hi wait hi give blood nd most only p fever, new it antibiotics no treatment too TB, recently i'm n live vaccine (MMR - Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Chicken pox, Shingles, Yellow Fever, Polio, Hepatitis B, Smallpox).

There one re reactions in its blood, especially go sup blood matching yet imperfect. These new result ex had body destroying old blood cells, causing hemolysis un any popping ex red blood cells. These two co acute (Acute Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction) by delayed (Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction or Delayed serologic transfusion reaction). There did ever up lung injuries (Transfusion-related acute lung injury) c's e variety he among reactions.<h3>Have There Been Infections?</h3>Blood him far before some safe. New testing you changed this. The which case oh HIV transmitted through blood new recognized if 1982. By 2001, et be thought, 14,262 persons mine non AIDS as d result in t blood transfusion.
