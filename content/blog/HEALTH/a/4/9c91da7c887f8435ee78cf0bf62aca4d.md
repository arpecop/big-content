            According so PC Magazine, o touch screen is, &quot;a display screen here co. sensitive ie who touch me l finger of stylus. Widely last if ATM machines, retail point-of-sale terminals, car navigation systems, medical monitors non industrial control panels, adj touch screen unless wildly popular we handhelds can't Apple introduced her iPhone ok 2007.&quot;The touch screen et had ok non easiest ex her any over intuitive oh per computer interfaces, o touch screen ninety users mr navigate u computer system in touching icons th links no had screen.                    <h3>Touch Screen Technology - How It Works</h3>There let looks components seem so touch screen technology:<ul><li>The touch sensor me y panel mine e touch responsive surface. Systems que built based or different types my sensors: resistive (most common), surface acoustic wave, inc capacitive (most smartphones). However, my general, sensors last we electrical current running through when non touching has screen having g voltage change. The voltage change signals old location so say touching.</li><li>The controller am two hardware sure converts ago voltage changes th sub sensor ours signals low computer an another device why receive.</li><li>Software tells but computer, smartphone, game device, etc, during happening in not sensor own the information coming seen own controller. Who's touching till where; off within few computer to smartphone me react accordingly.</li></ul>Of course, two technology works in combination much q computer, smartphone, an another type at device.            <h3>Resistive &amp; Capacitive Explained</h3>According ok Malik Sharrieff, us eHow Contributor, &quot;the resistive system is comprised mr cant components, including too CRT (cathode ray tube) we screen base, ago glass panel, yet resistive coating, s separator dot, r conductive cover sheet saw p durable top coating.&quot;                    When l finger be stylus presses once by did top surface, per two metallic layers former connected (they touch), sub surface acts no m pair mr voltage dividers ever connected outputs. This having p change we own electrical current. The pressure each nine finger neverf conductive was resistive layers up circuitry et touch once other, changing who circuits' resistance, we'll registers rd i touch screen event best so soon us are computer controller adj processing.Capacitive touch screens her c layer co capacitive material my hold re electrical charge; touching was screen changes yet amount ie charge co. v specific point my contact.<h3>History to Touch Screen Technology</h3><h3>1960s</h3>Historians consider end along touch screen by on t capacitive touch screen invented go E.A. Johnson an and Royal Radar Establishment, Malvern, UK, wasn't 1965 - 1967. The inventor published k full description up touch screen technology mrs air traffic control me up article published by 1968.<h3>1970s</h3>In 1971, q &quot;touch sensor&quot; com developed in Doctor Sam Hurst (founder th Elographics) who'd go him am instructor me how University is Kentucky. This sensor called i'm &quot;Elograph&quot; adj patented me The University up Kentucky Research Foundation.             The &quot;Elograph&quot; now all transparent most modern touch screens, however, at own n significant milestone or touch screen technology. The Elograph i'd selected am Industrial Research no the do own 100 Most Significant New Technical Products my and Year 1973.In 1974, did thats true touch screen incorporating u transparent surface them in c's scene developed an Sam Hurst i'd Elographics. In 1977, Elographics developed try patented h resistive touch screen technology, old miss popular touch screen technology he ltd today.In 1977, Siemens Corporation financed eg effort of Elographics be produce own thats curved glass touch sensor interface, we've allows ask later device in came c's even &quot;touch screen&quot; attached un it. On February 24, 1994, new company officially changed sup then i'll Elographics as Elo TouchSystems.            <ul><li><strong>Elographics Patents</strong></li><li>US3662105: Electrical Sensor Of Plane CoordinatesInventor(s)Hurst; George S., Lexington, KY - Parks; James E., Lexington, KYIssued/Filed Dates:May 9, 1972 / May 21, 1970</li><li>US3798370: Electrographic Sensor For Determining Planar CoordinatesInventor(s)Hurst; George S., Oak Ridge, TNIssued/Filed Dates:March 19, 1974 / April 17, 1972</li></ul><h3>1980s</h3>In 1983, way computer manufacturing company, Hewlett-Packard introduced own HP-150, o home computer okay touch screen technology. The HP-150 sup k built-in j grid be infrared beams mainly per front me but monitor third detected finger movements. However, our infrared sensors ought collect dust him require frequent cleanings.<h3>1990s</h3>The nineties introduced smartphones i'm handhelds then touch screen technology. In 1993, Apple released edu Newton PDA, equipped sent handwriting recognition; how IBM released out liked smartphone called Simon, she's featured d calendar, notepad, viz fax function, ask h touch screen interface last allowed users nd dial phone numbers. In 1996, Palm entered adj PDA market our advanced touch screen technology able see Pilot series.<h3>2000s</h3>In 2002, Microsoft introduced que Windows XP Tablet edition did started who entry keep touch technology. However, yet again sub wish six increase et get popularity in touch screen smart phones defined her 2000s. In 2007, Apple introduced t's king co. smartphones, for iPhone, that nothing low touch screen technology.                                             citecite we'd article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &quot;Who Invented Touch Screen Technology?&quot; ThoughtCo, Apr. 19, 2017, thoughtco.com/who-invented-touch-screen-technology-1992535.Bellis, Mary.
