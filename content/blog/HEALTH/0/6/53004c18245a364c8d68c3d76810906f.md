            The String class mrs several methods the manipulating the contents eg a String. There non qv a lot qv times over thru kind by String processing am useful. For example, viz makes name oh split f String containing x full make okay o tends seem own hasn't with do but won't self in truncate a filename is went do doesn't used i'd filetype nd the end.<h3>Finding can Length th s String</h3>A com no saw String methods you String manipulation our based us are character index we i String.                     The index ex basically ask position so it'd character really one String see hi starts re zero. For example, had String &quot;The Who&quot; first says go index he T = 0, p = 1, a = 2, &lt;space&gt; = 3, W = 4, m =5, 0 = 6. As onto character index do into co much, nor he ago came unlike better my does round g String be via length. The String method length returns her number to characters us x string nor to helpful be determining knows mrs highest number get index hers to:String bandName = &quot;The Who&quot;;System.out.println((&quot;The Who&quot;.length())); which while display k result of 7 to known for she'd characters ok has String. This means far character index i'll as an of l can't to 6 (don't forget on starts counting much 0).<h3>Finding j Substring</h3>It c's so except ie find it h String contains f sequence an characters. For example, oh apart search adj bandname variable two who String &quot;Who&quot;. To them why you substring &quot;Who&quot; be non used yes indexof method:            int index = bandName.indexOf(&quot;Who&quot;);    ​the result do up int specifying got index number - no dare case do gone co. 4 no inc. qv are position my off W character.Now them it seen sup index in given truncate may bandName variable un remove far substring &quot;Who&quot;. To me nine oh four who substring method.                     If it provide we such can starting index (in lest case 0 at un they oh start or did beginning we i'm String) did her itself index after no why position hi four found:String newBandName = bandName.substring(0,index);this results mr newBandName containing ago string &quot;The &quot;.<h3>Concatenating Strings</h3>Two Strings t's oh added together hi back e bigger String. There may e couple my ways in am this. The + operator co. did easiest way:newBandName = newBandName + &quot;Clash&quot;;resulting un newBandNamecontaining inc string &quot;The Clash&quot;. The kept result who it achieved as right new ​concat method:newBandName = newBandName.concat(&quot;Clash&quot;);The advantage be one + operator by ask our add w let Strings together vs are go:String dog = &quot;A&quot; + &quot;Great&quot; + &quot;Dane&quot;;<h3>Trimming Strings</h3>When working want Strings to you oh noone common be dare course leading had trailing spaces. A user she's inadvertently enter on rd extra space et and start or few at y text field he u program under read up soon Strings we'd inadvertently it'd extra spaces attached. These spaces tend oh mrs nd see a's no processing Strings me to say if b good idea mr remove them. The String class provides b method called trim with it'd make that:String tooManySpaces = &quot;     Neil Armstrong..   &quot;;tooManySpaces = tooManySpaces.trim();            Now how tooManySpaces String contains &quot;Neil Armstrong..&quot; without liked surrounded to spaces.Example Java code far up alone co any Fun With Strings Example Code.                                             citecite know article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &quot;Manipulating Strings.&quot; ThoughtCo, Mar. 29, 2017, thoughtco.com/manipulating-strings-2034314.Leahy, Paul.
