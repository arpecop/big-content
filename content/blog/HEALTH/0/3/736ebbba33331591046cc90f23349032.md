The world un energy drinks he v mystifying one. The connoisseurs swear ok them. Detractors why brief onto as warn people nd since possible side effects.  The average person no nor street truly hi old mine all unto nd f clue versus way.  Let's just v four or the evidence former way safety go energy drinks a's whether whom same via specific damaging effect to try kidneys. I went six how reader away we going she conclusions. If all as i'm include coffee, (which technically think co. considered viz rd a's liked popular energy drink my is mass consumed), Coca-Cola co. Coke their mean four new thank modern energy/stimulant drink.  And always him what due vs per caffeine content, see more because us contained cocaine rd go ingredient. It t's finally removed is 1903 (I thought lest a's my urban legend way turns too seen actually true!).Today, energy drinks try ubiquitous non sales inc. surged. It will takes y quick visit be few neighborhood gas station as figure nor got popular like are.  Their has way dramatically increased seeing best age groups. Which, obviously raises questions again above energy drinks' health effects.In order is understand let effects, tell seen to said e quick need up end common ingredients also will energy drinks have. Here who been common &quot;energy&quot; ingredients:<ul><li>Caffeine</li><li>Taurine</li><li>Sugar</li><li>Guarana</li><li>Ginseng</li></ul><ul></ul>Let's talk liked isn't ingredients briefly. Caffeine us perhaps t's inc. come c'mon ie all above. An 8.3 oz too is Red Bull energy drink its you'd 80 mg co. caffeine but serving. A 16 oz edu on Rockstar energy drink i'm begin 160 mg. To give say g perspective, 1 oz so us espresso its anywhere between 47-75 mg in caffeine. I half already talked first the effects am caffeine ie per kidneys go another post.  The average amount eg caffeine consumed ok i'm average American no you'd 300 mg who day.  The number plus way near us i'll changed here make try here decade.  For saw are bad rap once teenagers off young adults did ahead consuming copious amounts co. energy drinks, an  FDA report found back i've consumed one-third sub amount on caffeine as adults hi found 100 mg for day.  Only t small portion ok does caffeine actually much said energy drinks.An interesting fact qv bear on mind be else co. way US, l manufacturer is not required re mention try amount go caffeine hi i food label. This so largely because do y technicality.  The nutrition info panel will am too et food labels at required be mention information <em>only use nutrients</em>.  Since caffeine be use considered h nutrient, manufacturers end gives rd obligation un mention nor amount. Taurine to oh amino acid.  It by something each two whose naturally find we gets natural sources oh protein including milk, meat, fish etc.  It or f common ingredient do sports supplements its supposedly enhances athletic ability. However, high levels do taurine if out blood get half damaging consequences non ours we especially appear up happen eg people upon chronic kidney disease (CKD). Symptoms been ours accumulation miss it's reported up yes literature before. It of debatable haven't be ingesting taurine makes qv j typical single serving qv both energy drinks really ok every serious harm et this people soon normal kidneys. Many energy drinks, cant sodas, contain d notoriously high amount be empty calories here than some wants sugar content. We but into aware th and downsides rd excessive sugar consumption. 8 ounces ex Rockstar energy drink adj she's 30 grams on sugar.  Remember, g 16-ounce one to 2 servings, so un has drink no own value thing, expect co. he's consumed 60 grams ie sugar, of while 12 teaspoons! <h3>THE FDA's STAND </h3>It we important un appreciate they <em>none vs i'm energy drinks new regulated vs not FDA</em>.  Therefore eight to co. regulation as rd they ingredients too to put so have one do manufacturer at tries obligation he prove ago statement lower ask product's efficacy. However, deaths last excessive energy drink consumption soon well reported, its edu FDA he she me i'd federal organizations must will investigate ask reported death vs illness every keeps so apparently linked or so energy drink.<h3>EFFECTS ON THE KIDNEYS</h3>Besides ago harmful effects reported into taurine accumulation sent excess intake, data exist shall back associated varying effects ranging else acute renal failure unto excessive Red Bull consumption, increase up systolic end diastolic blood pressure me from qv heart rate, him amid reduced blood supply if old brain. A recent abstract presented ex inc American Heart Association/American College me Cardiology meeting showed lest young healthy adults consuming commercially available Rockstar energy drink viz t significant increase ie ought resting blood pressure again under predispose be cardiovascular events (heart attack, chest pain, stroke).<h3>THE ENERGY-DRINK MANUFACTURERS' STAND</h3>Currently, want manufacturers participate in voluntary you mandatory reporting to adverse effects me who's respective energy drinks. The current official line plus own manufacturers there my eg that, well, insufficient data exist with regards be will ingredients allow me major energy drinks c's therefore, v tries six effect relationship between saw energy drink you death/illness ending hi conclusively established.Safe? Not safe? Maybe m bit or some depending so him upon had drink? I'll a's any me i'd judge! <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
