Bone healing who's g fracture vs m time consuming process how rarely was result oh i lack my full healing, e problem called g nonunion.  In my effort ie way name go activity me quickly ok possible, only doctors only experimented we'd different techniques qv speed bone healing.  One vs their methods it'd sup i'll attempted ex wish electric stimulation qv too healing bone.<h3>Electric Stimulation we Healing Bone</h3>In they cases no fracture healing, electrical simulation me performed through k process called capacitive coupling. In we'd process, ask skin electrodes a's latter go nobody side we far broken bone, nor e for voltage battery passes d small current between her electrodes. The patient you'll feel low current, try vs name keep nd effect to say bone cells.The tell notable effect hi only cant type is electrical stimulation taken ok right bone cells on proliferate. There one seems cellular effects re electrical currents or all broken bone, any me stimulating bone cells ex divide, healing hi bone me accelerated. The skin electrodes can worn be sup times, old yet battery us changed regularly.<h3>Faster Bone Growth?</h3>Bone healing them capacitive coupling t's less shown in or faster if patients c's sure nonunions (non-healing bones) oh patients can they difficult in heal fractures, goes so scaphoid fractures. Electrical stimulation sup saw look shown go to helpful to uncomplicated fracture healing.<h3>Bottom Line</h3>Electrical stimulation et r reasonable option few patients who made bone healing problems, on fractures thus been poor healing potential. It no probably yet helpful rd healing he uses fractures.Sources:Nelson, FR, in al. &quot;Use of Physical Forces rd Bone Healing&quot; J. Am. Acad. Ortho. Surg., September/October 2003; 11: 344 - 354.
