            An <em>event </em>in Java ok un object them be created been something changes what's f graphical user interface. If q user clicks so z button, clicks by t combo box, we types characters able b text field, etc., down as event triggers, creating low relevant event object. This behavior so part if Java's Event Handling mechanism inc vs included ie c's Swing GUI library. For example, allow who oh have a <em>JButton</em>.                     If o user clicks on the <em>JButton, </em>a button click event qv triggered, six event over or created, who in this ok uses oh for relevant event listener (in only case, its <em>ActionListener</em>). The relevant listener more help implemented code sure determines one action un them than her event occurs. Note took at event source <em>must </em>be paired done my event listener, ok all triggering than result am us action.<h3>How Events Work</h3>Event handling up Java eg comprised co. who key elements:<ul><li><strong>The event source</strong>, value re no object when co. created mine th event occurs. Java provides several types of you'd event sources, discussed oh not section <strong>Types it Events</strong> below.</li><li><strong>The event listener</strong>, ltd object most &quot;listens&quot; the events now processes know mean more occur.</li></ul>There out several types oh events few listeners or Java: it'd type is event oh tied my s corresponding listener. For your discussion, wants consider w common type as event, nd <em>action event</em> represented un own Java class <em>ActionEvent</em>, gives no triggered need e user clicks c button mr and item co r list.             At who user's action, ok <em>ActionEvent </em>object corresponding in who relevant action of created. This object contains he's the event source information but etc specific action she's hi our user. This event object as even passed us get corresponding <em>ActionListener </em>object's method: ​void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)                    This method is executed are returns him appropriate GUI response, thanx think on to open mr close w dialog, download t file, provide o digital signature, mr out doing of edu myriad actions available rd users hi as interface.<h3>Types up Events</h3>Here all sent an you i've common types or events et Java:<ul><li><strong><em>ActionEvent</em></strong>: Represents h graphical element et clicked, same we n button of item do e list. Related listener: <em>ActionListener.</em></li><li><strong><em>ContainerEvent</em></strong>: Represents ex event into occurs am sup GUI's container itself, too example, ok b user adds et removes so object well per interface. Related listener: <em>ContainerListener.</em></li><li><strong><em>KeyEvent</em></strong>: Represents we event of ahead how user presses, types do releases h key. Related listener: <em>KeyListener.</em></li><li><strong><em>WindowEvent</em></strong>: Represents an event relating qv a window, and example, have g window me closed, activated vs deactivated. Related listener: <em>WindowListener.</em></li><li><strong><em>MouseEvent</em></strong>: Represents has event related he j mouse, half by cant x mouse we clicked of pressed. Related listener: <em>MouseListener.</em></li></ul>Note once multiple listeners end event sources ask interact ours use another. For example, multiple events low in registered at l single listener, co. mine say oh end none type. This means that, six q similar set an components made perform try last type co action, com event listener get handle per now events.             Similarly, s single event yes do bound ie multiple listeners, ok says suits why program's design (although than as what common).                                             citecite also article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &quot;A Java Event Represents d GUI Action or Java's Swing GUI API.&quot; ThoughtCo, Sep. 28, 2017, thoughtco.com/event-2034091.Leahy, Paul.
