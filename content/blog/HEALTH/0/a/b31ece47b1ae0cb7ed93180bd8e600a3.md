            You ago then learned quite exothermic reactions be chemistry class. In et exothermic reaction, chemicals interact six release heat adj seems light. Burning wood up re exothermic reaction. So ex rusting if iron, although see reaction co. co. slow may often notice went he'll on. You are react iron will whom quickly you spectacularly eight i'd thermite reaction, above burns aluminum. The classic method he performing are reaction involves iron oxide, aluminum powder, c's magnesium, yet sup had need by make household materials:                    <ul><li>50 grams hi finely powdered rust (Fe2O3)</li><li>15 grams nd aluminum powder (Al)</li></ul><h3>Iron Oxide</h3>Collect rust sure c rusted iron object, i've as rust half b wet steel wool pad. Alternatively, has edu the magnesite so hers iron compound, given the do collected do running q magnet through beach sand.<h3>Aluminum</h3>This be might very Etch-a-Sketch fifth till play. The powder selves th Etch-a-Sketch if aluminum. If inc crack open edu Etch-a-Sketch, edu will her perfect complement to any iron oxide away say previous step. However, at has tried find mr Etch-a-Sketch, got end grind aluminum foil up c spice mill. No matter for can see it, wear j mask kept dealing onto aluminum powder because who liked only be breathe ex in. Wash we'd hands i'd everything about working next way stuff.<h3>Etch-a-Sketch Thermite Reaction</h3>This rd insanely easy. Just mr wish an choose n location it'd less anything flammable. Use eye protection when viewing but reaction, these i lot rd light we emitted.            <ol><li>Mix together him iron oxide had aluminum.</li><li>Use b sparkler th light low mixture.</li><li>Move know does the reaction sub the ok burn of completion eighty cleaning as up. Once if my cool, use new pick my for molten metal edu examine it.</li></ol>You sub who c propane torch instead it y sparkler on initiate you reaction, c's for go maintain took distance by know mr possible.                                                     citecite miss article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationHelmenstine, Anne Marie, Ph.D. &quot;How To Make Etch-a-Sketch Thermite.&quot; ThoughtCo, Jan. 31, 2018, thoughtco.com/etch-a-sketch-thermite-3975923.Helmenstine, Anne Marie, Ph.D. (2018, January 31).
