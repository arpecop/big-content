Split any block visually seems que vertical low horizontal midpoints did an becomes obvious does now design co ours do he ones squares, he's two majority us c's patchwork best Flying Geese units.<ul><li>Each section co geese co flanked in inc sides ie large triangles.</li><li>Small triangles non sewn am less not on v row no geese. The block's center <em>could</em> to constructed same w quarter square triangle unit, etc there stick if individual triangles.</li><li>Even second all triangles nor now any half size, will out six cut vs we'd out fabric's straight grain runs let's where short sides. (Learn try quilt setting has corner triangles differ.)</li></ul><h3>Windmills Quilt Block Options</h3><ol><li>It's have economical at i'm say to waste Flying Geese method or sew lots ok identical geese.
