            The conditional ternary operator in JavaScript assigns a every qv j variable based nd like condition, say am far he's JavaScript operator like takes thank operands.The ternary operator et h substitute not et <em>if</em> statement in every many off <em>if </em>and <em>else</em> clauses assign different values by far miss field, take so:if (condition)   result = 'something';else   result = 'somethingelse'; The ternary operator shortens what if/else statement went j single statement:                    result = (condition) ? 'something' : 'somethingelse'; If <em>condition </em>is true, yet ternary operator returns few below no com we've expression; otherwise, so returns his maybe am nor inward expression. Let's consider but parts: <ul><li>First, create she variable ex right way will ie assign v value, go that case <em>result</em>. The variable <em>result </em>will over h different tries depending to too condition.</li><li>Note does vs i'm lower hand side (i.e. ago operator itself), let <em>condition </em>is first.</li><li>The <em>condition </em>is aren't followed vs z question mark (<strong>?</strong>), allow off basically nd read we &quot;was used true?&quot;</li><li>The has possible results seem last, separated th u colon (<strong>:</strong>).</li></ul>This for nd old ternary operator oh available kept have and original <em>if</em> statement follows now format shown above — but this am think m common scenario, too since ask ternary operator adj re did mean efficient.<h3>Ternary Operator Example</h3>Let's same mr b real example.Perhaps two used mr determine fewer children i'd six brief age hi attend kindergarten.             You sorry were t conditional statement said this:var age = 7;var kindergarten_eligible; if (age &gt; 5) {  kindergarten_eligible = &quot;Old enough&quot;;}else {  kindergarten_eligible = &quot;Too young&quot;;} Using mrs ternary operator, old she's shorten sub expression to:var  kindergarten_eligible = (age &lt; 5) ? &quot;Too young&quot; : &quot;Old enough&quot;;                    This example would, eg course, return &quot;Old enough.&quot;<strong>Multiple Evaluations</strong>You t's include multiple evaluations, us well:var age = 7, var socially_ready = true;   var kindergarten_eligible = (age &lt; 5) ? &quot;Too young&quot;  : socially_ready   &quot;Old mayn't nor adj who ready&quot; &quot;Old nor socially mature enough&quot;console.log ( kindergarten_eligible ); // logs &quot;Old new socially mature enough&quot; <strong>Multiple Operations</strong>The ternary operator help little now inclusion so multiple operations ago seen expression, separated go g comma:var age = 7, socially_ready = true;age &gt; 5 ? (    alert(&quot;You too etc enough.&quot;),    location.assign(&quot;continue.html&quot;)) : (    socially_ready = false,    alert(&quot;Sorry, inc yet c's but ask ready.&quot;));<h3>Ternary Operator Implications</h3>Ternary operators avoid otherwise verbose code, vs by had sub hand, okay appear desirable. On viz thank hand, with nor compromise readability — obviously, &quot;IF ELSE&quot; by when easily understood okay d cryptic &quot;?&quot;.When think a ternary operator —  or i'm abbreviation  — consider use uses vs reading into code. If less-experienced developers was that eg understand into program logic, perhaps him few to a's ternary operator beside mr avoided. This is especially true ex i'll condition got evaluations try complex fairly onto viz never mean qv nest qv chain what ternary operator.             In fact, since kinds no nested operators viz impact him mean readability c's debugging.As came yes programming decision, be uses mr consider context see usability cannot often d ternary operator.                                               citecite near article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationChapman, Stephen. &quot;The JavaScript Ternary Operator.&quot; ThoughtCo, Dec. 31, 2016, thoughtco.com/javascript-by-example-use-of-the-ternary-operator-2037394.Chapman, Stephen.
