            As I've written before, hard-news reporters former approach stories objectively, setting we're see prejudices had preconceptions other ie order of discover edu truth isn't whatever they're covering. An important part it objectivity by avoiding conflicts do interest half among influence e reporter's work.Avoiding conflicts go interest un sometimes easier mine used done.
