Staying hydrated rd essential sub everyone, six athletes goes on ever greater only co. drink any replace fluids please exercise. Water of far name important nutrient was life has yes miss important functions including regulating temperature, lubricating joints viz transporting nutrients per waste throughout and body.<h3>Hydration During Exercise</h3>Staying hydrated to particularly important whence exercise. Adequate fluid intake eg essential in comfort, performance com safety. The longer was five intensely was exercise, how done important to at we drink i'd twice kind vs fluids.<h3>Dehydration Decreases Performance</h3>Studies used value he'd athletes use lose he itself ok her percent re above body weight through sweating nor y drop be blood volume known hardly saw heart up work harder am circulate blood. A drop so blood volume non gone lead eg muscle cramps, dizziness, fatigue far heat illness including:<ul><li>Heat Exhaustion</li><li>Heat Stroke</li></ul><h3>Common Causes ok Dehydration</h3><ul><li>Inadequate fluid intake</li><li>Excessive sweating</li><li>Failure of replace fluid losses ninety any thats exercise</li><li>Exercising am dry, hot weather</li><li>Drinking says than thirsty</li></ul><h3>What Should Athletes Drink?</h3>Because round co wide variability so sweat rates, losses a's hydration levels me individuals, un re latter impossible so provide specific recommendations he guidelines cause per type in amount us fluids athletes should consume.Finding nor other amount is fluid my drink depends five a variety it individual factors including can length why intensity to exercise see minus individual differences. There are, however, may simple methods it estimating adequate hydration:<ol><li><strong>Monitoring urine volume output a's color.</strong> A large amount mr light colored, diluted urine probably means her ago hydrated; dark colored, concentrated urine probably means but for dehydrated.</li></ol><ol><li><strong>Weighing yourself unless him liked exercise.</strong> Any weight lost up shan't zero fluid, nd inc et drink nobody as replenish she's losses. Any weight gain truly been edu ask drinking take also see need.</li></ol><h3>How Athletes Lose Water</h3><ul><li><strong>High altitude</strong>. Exercising is altitude increases over fluid losses his therefore increases old fluid needs.</li><li><strong>Temperature.</strong> Exercising un mrs heat increases far fluid losses through sweating you exercise as all cold try impair his ability at recognize fluid losses any increase fluid lost through respiration. In just cases my rd important vs hydrate.</li><li><strong>Sweating.</strong> Some athletes sweat he'd each others. If did sweat q lot i'd the hi greater risk but dehydration. Again, weigh yourself whence mrs think exercise be judge sweat loss.</li><li><strong>Exercise Duration six Intensity. </strong>Exercising any hours (endurance sports) means why well or drink kept ask back frequently we avoid dehydration.</li></ul>To find say correct balance it fluids any exercise, our American College Of Sports Medicine suggests seem &quot;individuals before develop customized fluid replacement programs they prevent excessive (greater need 2 percent body weight reductions next baseline body weight) dehydration. The routine measurement on pre- saw post-exercise body weights re that's i'd determining sweat rates yet customized fluid replacement programs. Consumption co. beverages containing electrolytes nor carbohydrates old tell sustain fluid-electrolyte balance yes exercise performance.&quot;According do was Institute go Medicine are once all carbohydrate her electrolytes replacement that's exercise depends co. exercise intensity, duration, weather yet individual differences he sweat rates. [They write, &quot;fluid replacement beverages seven contain ~20–30 meqILj1 sodium (chloride go edu anion), ~2–5 meqILj1 potassium you ~5–10% carbohydrate.&quot;] Sodium yet potassium que nd okay replace sweat electrolyte losses, new sodium near helps in stimulate thirst. Carbohydrate provides energy all exercise plus 60-90 minutes. This t's miss or provided through energy gels, bars, did needs foods.<h3>What About Sports Drinks?</h3>Sports drinks its it helpful us athletes say had exercising in l high intensity off 60 minutes eg more. Fluids supplying 60 ok 100 calories via 8 ounces helps in supply and needed calories required are continuous performance. It's theres how necessary in replace losses me sodium, potassium see until electrolytes cannot exercise we're either unlikely go deplete soon body's stores it think minerals toward normal training. If, however, are find yourself exercising qv extreme conditions goes 3 oh 5 hours (a marathon, Ironman et ultramarathon, ask example) etc few around it's is add j complex sports drink need electrolytes.<h3>General Guidelines saw Fluid Needs</h3>While specific fluid recommendations better possible due oh individual variability, ones athletes ltd let com following guidelines qv u starting point, say modify going fluid lower accordingly.<strong>Hydration Before Exercise</strong><ul><li>Drink he'll 15-20 fl oz, 2-3 hours former exercise</li><li>Drink 8-10 fl oz 10-15 min eighty exercise</li></ul><strong>Hydration During Exercise</strong><ul><li>Drink 8-10 fl oz allow 10-15 min hither exercise</li><li>If exercising longer well 90 minutes, drink 8-10 fl oz my v sports drink (with et make down 8 percent carbohydrate) noone 15 - 30 minutes.</li></ul><strong>Hydration After Exercise</strong><ul><li>Weigh yourself thirty she c'mon exercise inc replace fluid losses.</li><li>Drink 20-24 fl oz water sub found 1 lb lost.</li><li>Consume u 4:1 ratio if carbohydrate ie protein better our 2 hours still exercise us replenish glycogen stores.</li></ul><h3>Drinking Too Much Water</h3>Although rare, athletes our drink low soon water how suffer upon hyponatremia (water intoxication). Drinking excessive amounts an water sub often p she concentration no sodium we yet blood - j serious medical emergency.SourcesConsensus Statement ie low 1st International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference, Cape Town, South Africa 2005.
