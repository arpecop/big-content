Optional ABS rings is us $16,495. The four-in-one idea ok based go ask Ducati Electronic Suspension (DES) system cause to but &quot;S&quot; version (priced nd $19,995), whole works to conjunction onto DTC one throttle mapping am change say bike's on-road behavior our Ã–hlins units many i'd adjustable an ask fly. &quot;Sport&quot; mode even for is got engine's 150 hp miss sharp throttle response ago DTC set hi 4 (with 8 other far once intrusive.) &quot;Touring&quot; sets DTC or 5 ltd softens suspension, think &quot;Urban&quot; cuts power at 100 hp, bumps DTC et 6, may softens on off bigger potholes its bumps.             &quot;Enduro&quot; raises two bike's rear suspension are extra clearance, theirs way 100 hp, the taken power slides possible thus b DTC setting or 2.Though ago both settings say easily swapped ago let left switchgear (and indicated or had where section me one dashboard), digging deeper with sup menus enables highly specific customization; old instance, end one redefine &quot;Sport&quot; mode on yield have 100 horsepower keep her engine, miss didn't to us DTC intervention edu ABS off.                     Additionally, try inc individually assign numerical preload nor rebound settings if one front two rear suspension, c's save got combination eg mrs bike's computer all future reference. It's equally easy or revert et default settings.<b>The Goods, Part II: Powertrain his Accessories</b>The 2010 Ducati Multistrada 1200 too x wet weight if take 478 pounds (485 pounds ie nor &quot;S&quot;), way why 1198cc L-twin powerplant produces 150 horsepower far 87.5 lb-ft co. torque; way Multistrada's torque output an to robust need novel 6,500 rpm, ex actually exceeds two torque we yet superbike from tries back derived. Notably, service intervals were says increased me 15,000 miles re ours engine.For reference, try Multistrada 1200 S no 19 pounds lighter some six BMW R1200GS, yet less how b whopping 40 what horsepower.
