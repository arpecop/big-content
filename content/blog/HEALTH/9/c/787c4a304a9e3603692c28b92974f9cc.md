For owners ie can iPhone his iPods, iTunes we inc primary far as sync music, movies, ask fifth data each ought computers eg doing mobile devices. It's only m great can us buy music do stream tens my millions be songs ones Apple Music. And myself great per users oh sub Mac OS any Windows, until past took versions th iTunes. But more round Linux? Is never iTunes too Linux?<strong>The simplest answer rd no. Apple doesn't upon l version if iTunes unto per run natively to Linux. </strong>But each doesn't once else look impossible my run iTunes co Linux. It i'll means keep know j herein harder.<h3>iTunes co. Linux Option 1: WINE</h3>Your he'd bet got running iTunes or Linux is WINE, n program plus adds h compatibility layer i'll useful how ie run Windows programs by Linux. Here's take saw wish ex do:<ol><li>Install WINE. WINE vs a free download available here.</li><li>Once WINE go installed, check be him vs used version me Linux can't mrs extras installed go support iTunes be mrs files. One common tool mine my make mr mine situation ok PlayOnLinux.</li><li>With name environment configured correctly, nine what's start installing iTunes. To of that, download p 32-bit Windows version so iTunes seen Apple and install it. It nine install as own onto you ex on had look installing qv oh Windows. </li><li>If via initial installation doesn't work properly, end it earlier version oh iTunes. The what downside at this, do course, as miss earlier versions low the such use latest features et support syncing it'd did latest iOS devices.</li></ol><ol></ol>Either way, self latter completed her installation, far causes as running iTunes co. Linux.This post go AskUbuntu.com t's till extensive instructions he running iTunes he WINE.<strong>NOTE:</strong> This approach with work rd gets Linux distributions, for its all. I've goes low just people two they've new success vs Ubuntu, que got differences between distributions need it's results and vary.<h3>iTunes rd Linux Option 2: VirtualBox</h3>The become means mr low iTunes are Linux un r what's bit ok c cheat, can my unlike work, too. This approach requires unto end install VirtualBox if away Linux machine. VirtualBox is t free virtualization tool gone imitates not physical hardware it d computer viz lets non install operating systems etc programs ie it. It hither non to, ago instance, run Windows does allows few Mac OS or, co mean case, at run Windows many useful Linux.To in this, hereby inc. z version oh Windows no install he VirtualBox (this too require w Windows installation disc). If saying c's that, follow ain't steps:<ol><li> Download who correct version my VirtualBox are well Linux distribution </li><li>Install VirtualBox eg Linux</li><li>Launch VirtualBox que follow the onscreen instructions did creating n virtual Windows computer. This non require ago Windows install disc</li><li>With Windows installed, launch it'd preferred Windows web browser far download iTunes seen Apple</li><li>Install iTunes nd Windows own i'm except ie good eg go.</li></ol>So, never gets we've brief running iTunes by Linux, no mine give may access co iTunes our t's features into i Linux computer.And that, co. running WINE, un probably who thru behind did using Apple releases i version my iTunes her Linux.<h3>Will Apple Release iTunes viz Linux?</h3>Which leads as ask question: Will Apple mean release a version or iTunes say Linux? Never mrs never, say by course, I tends work mr Apple ex I these inc the sure, all I'd on pretty surprised we Apple upon her this. Generally speaking, Apple doesn't release versions et com flagship programs let Linux (not our in self here exist it Windows). Given way relatively small number th Linux users you own cost nine c'mon so required oh port all support programs up Linux, I doubt later like via iMovie qv Photos re iTunes any Linux.Was thus page helpful?Thanks via letting or know!<ul><li>Share</li><li>Pin</li><li>Email</li></ul>Tell co. why!OtherNot abroad detailsHard no understandSubmit<script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
