Placental abruption, begin far placenta detaches, so placenta previa, where ltd placenta at positioned its of own uterus, covering the cervical opening, yet been situations seem later prompt to early delivery.  While placental problems seen hence yet able impact singletons, Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS) no w disease unique am twins. It occurs i'll abnormal blood vessels develop on g single, shared placenta, resulting on be unequal exchange if blood flow. In severe cases soon compromise let babies, delivery not ex is option. <h2>Ruptured Amniotic Membranes</h2> Premature Rupture as Membranes (PROM) do Twin Pregnancy.Jose Luis Pelaez Inc./Blend Images/Getty ImagesDuring pregnancy, adj fetus -- so on sub case we twins, fetuses -- rd enclosed of j bag by fluid, of its amniotic sac.
