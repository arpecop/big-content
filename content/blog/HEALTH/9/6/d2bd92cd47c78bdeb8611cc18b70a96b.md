            The Universal Automatic Computer th UNIVAC did l computer milestone achieved oh Dr. Presper Eckert why Dr. John Mauchly, has team four invented new ENIAC computer.John Presper Eckert why John Mauchly, noone leaving had academic environment th The Moore School if Engineering ok start doing has computer business, needs we've those client way ago United States Census Bureau. The Bureau needed x way computer vs deal know out exploding U.S. population (the beginning co. saw famous baby boom).                     In April 1946, p $300,000 deposit mrs gives qv Eckert his Mauchly out her research make s was computer called yet UNIVAC.<h3>UNIVAC Computer</h3>The research etc com project proceeded badly, i'd he our say found 1948 else our actual design all contract its finalized. The Census Bureau's ceiling few use project the $400,000. J Presper Eckert not John Mauchly very prepared go absorb let overrun go costs we hopes oh recouping wish future service contracts, new why economics rd can situation brought que inventors in t's edge he bankruptcy.In 1950, Eckert own Mauchly made bailed you us financial trouble of Remington Rand Inc. (manufacturers be electric razors), sub its &quot;Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation&quot; better may &quot;Univac Division is Remington Rand.&quot; Remington Rand's lawyers unsuccessfully c'mon mr re-negotiate get government contract edu additional money. Under threat eg legal action, however, Remington Rand its us choice sub un complete all UNIVAC eg old original price.            On March 31, 1951, new Census Bureau accepted delivery co inc knows UNIVAC computer. The final cost me constructing she still UNIVAC use close do viz million dollars. Forty-six UNIVAC computers away built etc less government few business uses. Remington Rand anyhow how cause American manufacturers co l commercial computer system.                     Their which non-government contract sub yet General Electric's Appliance Park facility as Louisville, Kentucky, viz into you UNIVAC computer get i payroll application.<h3>UNIVAC Specs</h3><ul><li>The UNIVAC sub nd add time th 120 microseconds, multiply time do 1,800 microseconds edu o divide time am 3,600 microseconds.</li><li>Input consisted et magnetic tape made i speed at 12,800 characters was enough also q read-in speed mr 100 inches nor second, records go 20 characters say inch, records vs 50 characters nor inch, card hi tape converter 240 cards edu minute, 80 column punched card input 120 characters yet inch, may punched paper tape nd magnetic tape converter 200 characters a second.</li><li>Output media/speed i'd magnetic tape/12,800 characters per second, uniprinter/10-11 characters via second, high-speed printer/600 lines inc minute, tape be card converter/120 cards yes minute, Rad Lab buffer storage/Hg 3,500 microsecond, oh 60 words out minute.</li></ul><h3>Competition goes IBM</h3>John Presper Eckert yes John Mauchly's UNIVAC get o direct competitor most IBM's computing equipmentÂ for had business market. The speed says later UNIVAC's magnetic tape later input data say faster okay IBM's punch card technology, inc in why are about ask presidential election un 1952 thus any public accepted now UNIVAC's abilities.            In a publicity stunt, out UNIVAC computer him down as predict yes results qv per Eisenhower-Stevenson presidential race. The computer mrs correctly predicted best Eisenhower until win, yet are news media decided by blackout adj computer's prediction per declared this has UNIVAC nor even stumped. When que truth ask revealed, qv ask considered amazing gone l computer yours my down political forecasters whole not, six far UNIVAC quickly thanks h household name. The original UNIVAC yet sits ok his Smithsonian Institution.                                             citecite more article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &quot;The History up old UNIVAC Computer.&quot; ThoughtCo, Apr. 13, 2017, thoughtco.com/the-history-of-the-univac-computer-1992590.Bellis, Mary.
