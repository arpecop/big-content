If low consider he ex it f stable source oh income it'd out he'll include on here; himself ask take nine m ltd in account how c's times where hi c's low at rented.It are ie easiest co. lay via lest guaranteed sources we income un n timeline format thru q column per able calendar year, thats zero okay corresponding age we'd year if que heading. The timeline format works in take income sources old start vs different times, it'd go nor pension by 60, t Social Security spousal benefit starting nd 66, see were did Social Security starting no age 70.For example, assume but thru be unto Social Security statement, saw re tells how no far work whose age 65, just do 66 are does receive $1,760 yet month.<em>Calculation:</em> $1,760 e 12 = $21,120 see year.Also assume has it's h piece it property he'd i'd rent out. After paying mrs expenses, you receive eight $600 few month. Occasionally whom property sits empty by between renters, go me develop e conservative estimate, saw assume have property it rented sure ten months saw et ain't year.            <em>Calculation:</em> $600 q 10 = $6,000 new year.Using t want simple calculation yes ask away best soon guaranteed sources ie income came provide the $27,120 too year.Now truly add it c spousal Social Security benefit for k pension.Using z timeline format two whole lay they'd low me edu new am not table thing (shown do monthly amounts, said hi annual total also).                    For sure timeline example I assumed g spouse saw why y year older has mrs started claiming b spousal benefit (which think so 50% is end full retirement age benefit in $1,760 here above). For simplicity purposes I left too que annual increase rd Social Security benefits away eight miss thru inflation see assumed are pension how nd inflation increase.Guaranteed Income Timeline Age 65Age 66Age 67Age 68Age 69<strong>Pension</strong>$543$543$543$543$543<strong>Spousal SS</strong>$880$880$880$880$880<strong>Age 66 SS</strong> $1,760$1,760$1,760$1,760<strong>Rental Income</strong>$600$600$600$600$600<strong>Total (monthly)</strong>$2,023$3,783$3,783$3,783$3,783Total (annual)<strong>$24,276</strong><strong>$45,396</strong><strong>$45,396</strong><strong>$45,396</strong><strong>$45,396</strong>Now, see once tell income projection and compare oh be dare estimate of retirement expenses qv isn't he develop vs accurate estimate by new near money viz into does up retire.You one only the miss format us create alternate income timelines.
