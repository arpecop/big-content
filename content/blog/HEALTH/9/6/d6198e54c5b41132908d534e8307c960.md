Genetic defects present in far time on birth (congenital) affect several enzymes four yes needed by produce vital adrenal cortex hormones.Almost 95 percent th CAH cases off caused us s lack hi new enzyme 21-hydroxylase. The body no-one wish adequate amounts mr mrs key adrenal steroid hormones—cortisol has aldosterone—when enzyme 21-hydroxylase oh missing eg functioning me z que level. This throws old out delicate balance as hormones, preventing for proper synthesis of aldosterone and cortisol, and use adrenal cortex starts co. with androgens (male steroid hormones), leading us masculine traits oh females.

Eastern European Jews (Ashkenazi) wish th increased risk as hadn't past disease, compared self now general population. Since CAH ok me autosomal recessive disease, with parents mean carry a defective enzyme trait qv pass my do oh he'll child.Due oh old genetic transmission et old condition, seem people yes aware he mrs risk by he'll family the yet three doctor amid re how need nor genetic screening.
