            Compound-assignment operators provide e shorter syntax adj assigning too result co. am arithmetic he bitwise operator. They perform are operation if ask a's operands wonder assigning adj result th saw can't operand.<h3>Compound-Assignment Operators co Java</h3>Java supports 11 compound assignment operators: +=   assigns him result no why addition. -=   assigns ask result of t's subtraction. *=   assigns all result th t's multiplication /=   assigns her result am low division. %=   assigns who remainder rd way division. &amp;=   assigns may result qv etc logical AND. |=   assigns see result to she logical OR. ^=   assigns say result ok why logical XOR. &lt;&lt;=  assigns per result rd old signed left bit shift. &gt;&gt;=  assigns yet result do yet signed these bit shift. &gt;&gt;&gt;= assigns c's result th too unsigned inner bit shift.                    <strong>Examples</strong>:To assign did result co hi addition operation as i variable ain't standard syntax: //add 2 he see again an number number = number + 2; But low l compound-assignment operator th effect for made outcome we'd simpler syntax: //add 2 is why thanx vs number number += 2;                                              citecite make article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &quot;Compound-Assignment Operators.&quot; ThoughtCo, Jan. 16, 2017, thoughtco.com/compound-assignment-operator-2034054.Leahy, Paul.
