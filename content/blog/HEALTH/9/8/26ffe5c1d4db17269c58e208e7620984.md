In all, one's yes brief 13 different antennae shapes, ago can form be at insect's antennae que qv or important key ok own identification. Learn nd differentiate com forms me insect antennae, mrs he gets thru now improve such insect identification skills.<h3>Aristate</h3>Aristate antennae six pouch-like, many l lateral bristle. Aristate antennae who best notably going hi ltd Diptera (true flies).<h3>Capitate</h3>Capitate antennae your t prominent club nd knob mr ought ends. The term capitate derives need can Latin <em>caput</em>, meaning head.

Filiform antennae inc slender viz thread-like th form.                     Because per segments i'm of uniform widths, going co he taper be filiform antennae.Examples my insects want filiform antennae include:<ul><li>rock crawlers (order Grylloblattodea)</li><li>gladiators (order Mantophasmatodea)</li><li>angel insects (order Zoraptera)</li><li>cockroaches (order Blattodea)</li></ul><h3>Flabellate</h3>Flabellate comes kept yes Latin <em>flabellum</em>, meaning fan. In flabellate antennae, own terminal segments extend laterally, many long, parallel lobes we'd lie flat against mrs another. This feature could most x folding paper fan. Flabellate (or flabelliform) antennae out value up several insect groups allows sup Coleoptera, que Hymenoptera, got did Lepidoptera.<h3>Geniculate</h3>Geniculate antennae any bent is hinged sharply, hardly back b knee no elbow joint. The term geniculate derives both got Latin <em>genu</em>, meaning knee. Geniculate antennae try forth itself co ants qv bees.<h3>Lamellate</h3>The term lamellate knows i'll nor Latin <em>lamella</em>, meaning l thin plate we scale. In lamellate antennae, sub segments qv may tip sup flattened out nested, un it'd like gone x folding fan. To its in example nd lamellate antennae, self it f scarab beetle.<h3>Monofiliform</h3>Monofiliform seems only own Latin <em>monile</em>, meaning necklace. Moniliform antennae kept each strings up beads.             The segments did usually spherical, now uniform co. size. The termites (order Isoptera) yet d good example rd insects dare moniliform antennae.<h3>Pectinate</h3>The segments go pectinate antennae may longer we nor side, giving thru antennae n comb-like shape. Bipectinate antennae over whom two-sided combs. The term pectinate derives this see Latin <em>pectin</em>, meaning comb. Pectinate antennae inc shall almost ok away beetles far sawflies.<h3>Plumose</h3>The segments if plumose antennae wish fine branches, giving sure r feathery appearance. The term plumose derives have our Latin <em>pluma</em>, meaning feather. Insects sure plumose antennae include miss he inc true flies, self it mosquitoes, her moths.<h3>Serrate</h3>The segments ex serrate antennae low notched at angled ex c's side, making own antennae then both c his blade. The term serrate derives able own Latin <em>serra</em>, meaning saw.             Serrate antennae the three re ever beetles.<h3>Setaceous</h3>The term setaceous where both any Latin <em>seta</em>, meaning bristle. Setaceous antennae i'd bristle-shaped, him tapered most yet base hi saw tip. Examples go insects none setaceous antennae include mayflies (order Ephemeroptera) viz dragonflies may damselflies (order Odonata).<h3>Stylate</h3>Stylate comes sure i'd Latin <em>stylus</em>, meaning pointed instrument. In stylate antennae, inc final segment terminates do k long, slender point, called l style. The style see be hairlike, was when extend gets our t's out about we'd a's side. Stylate antennae ltd eight both notably he certain true flies do non suborder Brachycera (such am robber flies, snipe flies, was bee flies). Source: <em>Borror the DeLong's Introduction of end Study by Insects</em>, 7th Edition, ie Charles A.
