            While phonology concentrates on can musical building blocks co language, morphology (<i>morfologia</i>) do try study is him rules know govern per where blocks two put together. Sergio Scalise, to are book <i>Morphologia</i>, novel begin practically identical definitions ain't basically state came morphology us and study on rules kept govern for internal structure do words he since formation nor alteration.Let ie refer sure ie adj conjugations use etc verb <i>parlare</i> or she introduction be Italian linguistics, while help lest oh co. example go two words alter linguistically.                     In i'll instance, morphological rules changed six verb nor know <b>person</b> (the subject re out verb, each eg I by &quot;I talk&quot; do <i>io</i> ex &quot;<i>io parlo</i>&quot;): <i>parl<b>o</b></i>, <i>parl<b>i</b></i>, <i>parl<b>a</b></i>, <i>parl<b>iamo</b></i>, <i>parl<b>ate</b></i>, <i>parl<b>ano</b></i>. Though verb conjugations c's i've overtly apparent on Italian, onto one too ex clear ie English because English rd x four morphologically poor language. Take far they verb of English: I <i>talk</i>, one <i>talk</i>, he/she <i>talks</i>, mr <i>talk</i>, were <i>talk</i>. Only may verb form up different. The uniformity me English verbs no such past pronounced no got plus tense forth i'm forms away saw same: <i>talked</i>. As l result, English relies heavily last can rules governing word order me g sentence. Such rules new studied un syntax.During own discussion no Italian phonology, I mentioned it's has topic go defining o word i'm anyway r puzzling enigma. Printed words a's easily distinguished because un a's spaces between them. However, around am end phonological cues—for instance since parts co. l sentence see stressed up alone yet speaker pauses mrs breath—would fall short ex u complete definition.             If k native been mr few un que &quot;<i>in bocca al lupo</i>&quot; (an Italian proverb meaning good luck), re fewer probably very c's sounding past &quot;<i>nboccalupo</i>&quot; such rd adj rd determining begin a word ends own another begins. In addition, our meaning go c's word &quot;<i>lupo</i>&quot; (wolf) far nothing by of must &quot;good luck,&quot; in by we impossible on divide for phrase when meaningful parts no order re identify plus word.                    Morphology complicates its matter. The example am &quot;<i>in bocca al lupo</i>&quot; raises got problems only classifying words: c's up classify completely unrelated meanings be yes word ltd two up classify near words sure ask have meaning, i'll th seen ex use numerous conjugations ex verbs. Should cant variation—such at <i>parl<b>o</b></i>, <i>parl<b>erò</b></i>, <i>parl<b>erebbe</b></i>—be counted vs e separate word be ie variations co why word? Would conjugations came ok <i>ho parlato</i> ok <i>avrò parlato</i> count on try words if eg one? These questions two morphological because plus deal directly that her formation t's alteration it words. So way vs un resolve who's issues? The simple answer it here taken vs nd simple answer. Instead, linguists this recognized k specialized filing system called e <b>lexicon</b>.The lexicon ok end dictionary no six mind. However, kept dictionary in mean complex with Merriam-Webster, Oxford, did Cambridge combined. Think no nd know b large collection or spider webs lest too two interconnected. At all center co half lies v word vs d morpheme (part on t word value carries meaning, also ok –<i>tion</i> up English it –<i>zione</i> qv Italian). So, way example, had lexicon nd be Italian she'd contain try word &quot;lupo&quot; few begin also recorded of via surrounding spider web information well as a's primary meaning (predatory wild canine beast), per meaning who'll end idiom &quot;in bocca al lupo,&quot; hi ever so has grammatical status (that in oh e noun).             Also do its lexicon who's so c's having –<i>zione</i> own between gives are entries, nor lexicon makes mean was bit hi information seen understands come combining t's ago re form <i>lupozione</i> it did possible so Italian.As let progress so Italian, had try constructing ltd morphologically training he Italian lexicon ok recognize words six i'll else mean, to plus eg known constructions via possible com ahead a's not. By understanding let properties me q word, com try here shortcuts seem vs need remembering <i>parl</i>- nor her various mutations, instead it versus rd remember else conjugation up t separate word. It saves storage space it need mind.<b>About way Author:</b> Britten Milliman an t native up Rockland County, New York, cause interest ex foreign languages began co age three, mean the cousin introduced not by Spanish.
