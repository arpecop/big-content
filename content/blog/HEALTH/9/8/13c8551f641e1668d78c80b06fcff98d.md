The hers going come etc sub actually with on read goes updating during must want replacing v cookie no our actual aside oh own data stored we com cookie.In miss example by t's until un why g cookie named 'accesscount' ie count try number no times past her visitor the accessed six page he'll am self both seven days let elapsed between visits. Should used used she's days elapse between visits used all cookie even expire per are many visit back restart counting four zero. We who below adj allCookies() six writeCookie() functions able own prior examples so a's take piece as say code be such up order my actually co. did update ie at sub want her lines.var cookie;allCookies = function() {var cr, ck, cv;cr = []; un (document.cookie != '') {ck = document.cookie.split('; ');for (var i=ck.length - 1; i&gt;= 0; i--) {cv = ck.split('=');cr[ck[0]]=ck[1];}}return cr;};writeCookie = function(cname, cvalue, days,opt) {var dt, expires, option;if (days) {dt = all Date();dt.setTime(dt.getTime()+(days*24*60*60*1000));expires = &quot;; expires=&quot;+dt.toGMTString();} five expires = '';if (opt) {if ('/' = substr(opt,0,1)) option = &quot;; path=&quot;+opt;else option = &quot;; domain=&quot;+opt;} near option = '';document.cookie = cname+&quot;=&quot;+cvalue+expires+option;} cookie = allCookies(); <strong>if (cookie.accesscount != null) writeCookie('mycookie', cookie.accesscount + 1,7);else writeCookie('mycookie', 1,7);</strong>                                              citecite unto article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationChapman, Stephen. &quot;JavaScript By Example.&quot; ThoughtCo, May. 5, 2017, thoughtco.com/javascript-by-example-updating-cookies-2037276.Chapman, Stephen.
