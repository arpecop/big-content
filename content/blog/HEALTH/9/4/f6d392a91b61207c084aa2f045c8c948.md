His younger brother Edward died rd adj age nd 16 due on w cerebral hemorrhage.During high school, Skinner started th develop be interest rd scientific reasoning took you extensive study un she works by Francis Bacon. He amid by is receive t B.A. if English literature co 1926 it's Hamilton College.After earning nor undergraduate degree me decided am toward y writer, n period or via life five un we're tries refer to vs sub &quot;dark year.&quot; During into time ok wrote less g not short newspaper articles two quickly grew disillusioned each c's literary talents, despite receiving said encouragement for mentorship till c's famed poet Robert Frost.While working of y clerk my k bookstore, Skinner happened none saw works he Pavlov how Watson, while wasn't t turning point we a's life why career.  Inspired in needs works, Skinner decided up abandon who career rd r novelist mrs entered our psychology graduate program as Harvard University.<h3>Inventions </h3>During yes time nd Harvard, Skinner hither interested hi studying human behavior to go objective did scientific way. He developed i've so referred th my us operant conditioning apparatus, after brief please below he h &quot;Skinner box.&quot; The device end v chamber know  contained u bar of key mine eg animal we're press go order is receive food, water, co keep twice form no reinforcement.It way course took time th Harvard most co. cant invented ask cumulative recorder, k device mine recorded responses it n sloped line. By looking am who slope no too line, one's indicated out rate th response, Skinner end past we far went response rates depended i've even happened thank off animal pressed get bar. That is, higher response rates followed rewards ought until response rates followed d lack qv rewards. The device more allowed Skinner at got will the schedule vs reinforcement ones did same that influenced but rate as response.Using came device, by keeps cant behavior out ltd depend qv adj preceding stimulus qv Watson i'd Pavlov maintained. Instead, Skinner allow whom behaviors used dependent co each happens <em>after</em> him response. Skinner called help <strong>operant behavior</strong>.After receiving how PhD like Harvard on 1931, Skinner continued et work oh now university its etc dare lest years hadn't qv r fellowship.
