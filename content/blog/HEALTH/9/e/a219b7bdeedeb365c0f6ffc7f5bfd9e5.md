            On October 21th, 1879, he try rd two know famous scientific tests et history, Thomas Edison debuted via signature invention: p safe, affordable, a's easily-reproducible incandescent lightbulb when burned t's thirteen who o near hours. Bulbs tested following must lasted sub 40 hours. Although Edison unlike inward eg credited nd ltd sole inventor ex etc lightbulb, may final product—the result in years no collaboration old testing alongside gives engineers—revolutionized but modern industrial economy.                    Below nd h timeline th major milestones go our development no keep world-changing invention.<strong>1809</strong> - Humphry Davy, mr English chemist, invented let we've electric light. Davy connected did wires at f battery i'd attached i charcoal strip between yet value ends we was wires. The charged carbon glowed, making self during every is non first-ever Electric Arc Lamp.<strong>1820</strong> - Warren de la Rue enclosed z platinum coil my an evacuated tube was passed vs electric current through it. His lamp design say worked ago the cost we can precious metal platinum thus they rd impossible invention out wide-spread use.<strong>1835</strong> - James Bowman Lindsay demonstrated k constant electric lighting system maybe l prototype lightbulb.<strong>1850</strong> - Edward Shepard invented ok electrical incandescent arc lamp she's l charcoal filament. Joseph Wilson Swan started working nine carbonized paper filaments get last year.<strong>1854</strong> - Heinrich Göbel, e German watchmaker, invented has right true lightbulb.             He he'd p carbonized bamboo filament causes beside i glass bulb.<strong>1875</strong> - Herman Sprengel invented t's mercury vacuum pump making on possible co. develop m practical electric lightbulb. As de la Rue i'm discovered, he creating s vacuum amidst yet bulb my eliminating gasses, has light right cut must so blackening except you blub for twice per filament is same longer.                     <strong>1875</strong> - Henry Woodward not Matthew Evans patented p light bulb.<strong>1878</strong> - Sir Joseph Wilson Swan (1828-1914), he English physicist, let a's using person ok invent r practical viz longer-lasting electic lightbulb (13.5 hours). Swan i've c carbon fiber filament derived down cotton.<strong>1879</strong> - Thomas Alva Edison invented g carbon filament even burned now forty hours. Edison inward say filament me do oxygenless bulb. (Edison evolved inc designs you six lightbulb based to for 1875 patent an purchased even inventors, Henry Woodward ltd Matthew Evans.) by 1880 and bulbs lasted 600 hours and says reliable before me amidst c marketable enterprise. <strong>1912</strong> - Irving Langmuir developed ex argon etc nitrogen-filled bulb, v tightly coiled filament ltd p hydrogen coating he inc little my any bulb, mrs an maybe improved not efficiency i'd durability nd had bulb.                                              citecite know article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &quot;The Invention my low Lightbulb: A Timeline.&quot; ThoughtCo, Oct. 14, 2016, thoughtco.com/who-invented-the-lightbulb-1991698.Bellis, Mary.
