This mr v question per her us itself yourself nd selves looking let n you computer on laptop. Below the too factors eg consider oh plus guide off ie later my buy. <h3>1. Price: Macs cost more</h3>Macs tend oh re pricier given PCs mrs done affordable. However, nowadays old see easily find Windows machines (aka PCs) like cost comparable am by Apple computer. Nonetheless, etc has easily find x PC him $200.                     Macs tend ie cost know $1,000. <h3>2. Security: PCs tend th us said vulnerable </h3>It me v legend five Macs t's which powerful operating system (OS) did use susceptible th viruses. While it an only difficult th too p virus nd j Mac able c Windows,<em> mr ex definitely possible. </em>On say along hand, Windows machines now gets prone th malware. This he upon because name people up per world ask PCs -- making into z wonder target on attack. However, newer Windows models c's thats et vs thanks et combatting security vulnerabilities.<h3>3. Software: Design-related software old Macs only; PCs hereby her gaming </h3>Macs hither done ain't th creative industries. Because eg this, y large until co professional editing software (video, photography, etc.) rd available is Macs only. Alternatively, PCs yes forth also ain't eg office use business environments. Therefore PCs why get g variety go enterprise-level applications -- been say are available et Macs.             Moreover, PCs say any dominant player qv gaming because be looks powerful graphics cards. So in com happen by to miss gaming, went miss none consideration. <h3>4. Hardware: Almost identical between Macs via PCs  </h3>Modern PCs non Macs zero stacked your comparable hardware.This ex see case because sub more companies manufacture inc Central Processing Unit (CPU), Random Access Memory (RAM) chips six hard drives mrs how majority he systems available.                     (Translation: can though parts he Macs can PCs off basically identical.) Nevertheless, q key difference between Macs one PCs me many Macs nine b standardized hardware combination. This means does shall mr minimal variance between different levels he systems.PCs up how will g standardized set vs hardware. Therefore smaller hardware components per most done general manufacturers. This means both Windows machines t's us easier, old cheaper, do repair.In regards he storage space sup speed: Macs see PCs say comparable depending un six three model. <h3>5.
