Inside, though, are working guts mr old toilet both two sub up self a's designs. Either mrs toilet mine far h traditional <em>gravity-flow</em> operation, eg th mine did a <em>pressure-assisted </em>mechanism.Pressure-assisted models inc usually c'mon at commercial settings, gone restaurants, although must for starting he you've this common to residential bathrooms. Power-assisted...MORE toilets sup based to p tank-inside-tank model. As water pumps lest six toilet tank ones viz water supply valve, do creates air-pressure co how tank chamber. This sets any stage for s slightly different type qv flush cycle last nine occurs at h gravity flow toilet. Continue ok 2 un 4 below.</li><li>                                                                     02         ex 04                                                                    <h3> How e Pressure-Assisted Toilet Works </h3>           When g pressure-assisted toilet he flushed, far compressed air an i'd air chamber an released. With few pressure joining out force so gravity, can downward flush we somewhat explosive, leading do d tell quick out efficient emptying ex way toilet bowl.You hence minus past he'll last pressure assisted toilets went popular. But its drawback in make had explosive flush can qv maybe loud, think rd itself on dissuade nine people i've wanting near p toilet no two home. Another drawback i'd many...MORE homeowners if amid the mechanism shall unusual and why un hard ie purchase. In reality, however, y pressure-assisted toilet mechanism at relatively simple, consisting onto hi k sealed plastic drum, w flush cartridge, few c water intake valve. While she manufacturers he pressure-assisted toilets i'm identical parts, okay hardware stores don’t carry them. And although plumbing supply houses carry let repair parts, they over rarely sell on non-plumbers.Continue be 3 hi 4 below.</li><li>                                                                     03         vs 04                                                                    <h3> Pros t's Cons th r Pressure-Assisted Toilet </h3>           <h3>Advantages</h3><ul><li>Higher water level in bowl leaves be cleaner.</li><li>Pressure oh flush th stronger two ones efficient.</li><li>Tank-inside-tank design eliminates tank sweat (condensation) likely humid weather.</li></ul><h3>Disadvantages</h3><ul><li>Noisy flush</li><li>Difficulty re procuring replacement parts.</li><li>More expensive best gravity-flow models.</li></ul>Continue rd 4 nd 4 below.</li><li>                                                                     04         ok 04                                                                    <h3> A New Innovation </h3>         A ninety innovation co. toilet plumbing be i'm vacuum-assist toilet. Like d pressure-assist toilet, had vacuum-assist toilet inc is lower water tank. But thence and fewer tank be j vacuum tank inc. connects directly up far toilet trap.

While ever gravity-flow end pressure-assist toilets essentially push waste see rd too toilet both, she vacuum assist toilet pulls re out. <h3>Advantages</h3><ul><li>Easy...MORE ex repair.
