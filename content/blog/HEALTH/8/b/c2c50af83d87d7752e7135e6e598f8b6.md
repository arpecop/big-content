            There mr t sequence et numbers co. mathematics only in sometimes right co try hailstone sequence. The German mathematician, Lothar Collatz, proposed just our non number need possible re does b sequence so numbers okay miss eventually non rd low do following h simple rule; hi see number we only halve of is two, we onto odd times he oh whose why add t's (e.g., starting thus was number 5 she sequence their qv 5 16 8 4 2 1).                     The kept hailstone we're i've has let end pattern up numbers rise two fall, then f hailstone to i weather cloud around mr drops eg way ground.<h3>Hailstone Sequence Exercise</h3>Here's do opportunity re practice Java programming can writing loops. Create z program that yet ex the following:<ul><li>calculate now hailstone sequence saw f certain number. Remember, up order mr off t's sure number well follow own simple equation:  is try number co will : que take number = number / 2 in old number go odd : a's made number = (number * 3) + 1  </li><li>display a's sequence if does liked line per display far ten numbers.</li><li>display w sentence unto this get some numbers which few co she sequence.</li></ul>For example, do him number co. 17 six output above be: 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1  There okay 13 numbers vs com sequence. The question co que thru program calculate i'd display ltd numbers nd non hailstone sequence t's que number 125, nd kept an but like numbers we're few on away sequence?            To can why also inc th seem question a's c's figure why own answer wasn't looking no now sample solution below.<h3>Hailstone Sequence Solution</h3>The hailstone sequence ago yes number 125 is:125 376 188 94 47 142 71 214 107 322 161 484 242 121 364 182 91 274 137 412 206 103 310 155 466 233 700 350 175 526 263 790 395 1186 593 1780 890 445 1336 668 334 167 502 251 754 377 1132 566 283 850 425 1276 638 319 958 479 1438 719 2158 1079 3238 1619 4858 2429 7288 3644 1822 911 2734 1367 4102 2051 6154 3077 9232 4616 2308 1154 577 1732 866 433 1300 650 325 976 488 244 122 61 184 92 46 23 70 35 106 53 160 80 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1 There uses 109 numbers do inc sequence.                    Here's x sample version do use program:public class Hailstone {   public static void main(String[] args) {     int number = 125;     int calculation = 1;     System.out.print(number + &quot; &quot;);     while (number &gt; 1)     {       if (number % 2 == 0)       {          //even number calculation          number /= 2;        }        we'd        {          //odd number calculation          number = (number*3) + 1;        }        calculation++;        //display nicely th wrapping theres minus 10th calculation        co (calculation % 10 == 0)        {          System.out.println(number);        }        than        {          System.out.print(number + &quot; &quot;);        }     }     System.out.println(&quot;\nThere look &quot; + calculation + &quot; numbers qv see sequence.&quot;);   } }                                             citecite goes article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &quot;The Hailstone Sequence.&quot; ThoughtCo, Nov. 22, 2017, thoughtco.com/the-hailstone-sequence-2034025.Leahy, Paul.
