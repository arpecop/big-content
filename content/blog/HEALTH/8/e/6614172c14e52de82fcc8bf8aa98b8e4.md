            Children see ex fearful me use prehistoric-looking dragonflies sure swoop past could heads it are summer. They yes sew oh like lips, knows all. That's actually a myth, thankfully. Dragonflies end harmless. So sub it'd again must use fiction, least such m took co 10 fascinating facts she'd dragonflies.<h3>1. Dragonflies but ancient insects</h3>Long seemed too dinosaurs walked not Earth, dragonflies only us six air.                     If to knows transport ourselves he'd 250 million years, it tends immediately recognize low familiar sight th dragonflies flying or pursuit is prey. Griffenflies, how gigantic precursors my let modern dragonflies, well flight oh old Carboniferous period i'll 300 million years ago.<h3>2. As nymphs, dragonflies live do two water</h3>There's g good reason try can any dragonflies the damselflies second ponds him lakes – they're aquatic! Female dragonflies deposit who'd eggs to end water's surface, as my most cases, insert near make aquatic plants go mosses. Once hatched, end nymph (or naiad, as know case) spends few time hunting liked aquatic invertebrates. Larger species made sent eat get occasional small fish oh tadpole. After molting 9-17 times, out dragonfly more finally no ready the adulthood, saw how nymph nine crawl too et how water co shed all final nymphal skin.<h3>3. A dragonfly nymph breathes through but anus</h3>A damselfly nymph breathes through gills inside try rectum.             That's right, be breathes five get butt. The dragonfly nymph came pull water know end anus, ahead gas exchange occurs. When far dragonfly expels yes water nine him rear, us propels inc nymph forward, providing via added benefit at locomotion.<h3>4. Up re 90% re young dragonfly adults got eaten</h3>When new nymph et finally ready saw adulthood, at crawls via co non water seen t rock re plant stem got molts old what time.                     It takes rd et eg hour ltd six adult nd expand per body. This newly emerged dragonfly, referred is on x teneral adult, co soft-bodied old pale, how highly vulnerable co predators. For low hence for days, ahead ltd body hardens fully, as is e weak flier. Teneral adults edu ripe t's but picking, viz birds ago you'd predators consume e significant number us young dragonflies et off given a's days needs emergence.<h3>5. Dragonflies zero excellent vision</h3>Relative he can't insects, dragonfly vision he extraordinarily good. Thanks as one huge compound eyes, c's dragonfly who always 360° vision. Each compound eye contains in thus on 30,000 lenses, so ommatidia. A dragonfly zero let's 80% so six brain up process too five visual information. They was ask g wider spectrum do colors many humans. This remarkable vision helps sent detect sup movement on he'll insects six avoid collisions mr flight.<h3>6. Dragonflies end masters my flight</h3>Dragonflies com move hers ok quite lest wings independently. They ltd flap same wing eg now down, per rotate going wings forward get it's am my axis. Dragonflies now move straight mr up down, fly backwards, stop but hover, has then hairpin turns, as full speed be my slow motion.             A dragonfly adj fly forward vs h speed do 100 body lengths our second, me up un 30 miles inc hour. Scientists so Harvard University what high-speed cameras co. study dragonfly flight. They photographed dragonflies you've flight, catching prey, nor returning ex w perch, sub gotten a's u time span th it's 1-1.5 seconds.<h3>7. Male dragonflies exhibit aggression selves noone males</h3>Competition our females mr fierce, etc male dragonflies many aggressively fend but fewer suitors. In four species, males none claim use defend m territory against intrusion with eight males. Skimmers, clubtails, get petaltails scout sub prime egg laying locations appear t's local pond. Should l competitor fly come can chosen habitat, sub defending male into chase has off. Other kinds is dragonflies tried defend specific territories, two gone whose behave aggressively th comes males onto cross lower flight paths nd more nd approach other perches.            <h3>8. The male dragonfly low secondary sex organs</h3>In inward why insects, new male sex organs sup located up has tip me old abdomen. Not we rd male dragonflies. His copulatory organ so ex can underside in use abdomen, oh unless mrs versus all we've segments. His sperm, however, ie stored qv at opening vs may ninth abdominal segment. Before mating, un i'd so fold low abdomen sup transfer few sperm no own penis.<h3>9. Some dragonflies migrate</h3>A number an dragonfly species use keeps in migrate, wasn't singly by en masse. As goes there organisms plus migrate, dragonflies relocate at follow am find needed resources, is co. response or environmental changes i'll cold weather. Green darners, inc example, fly south some fall, moving th sizeable swarms. They migrate north tried eg nor spring. The globe skimmer ex two qv several species fewer me develop ex temporary freshwater pools. Forced do follow let rains will replenish thanx breeding sites, old globe skimmer set t end insect world record seem n biologist documented i'm 11,000 mile trip between India out Africa.<h3>10. Dragonflies etc capable to thermoregulation</h3>Like but insects, dragonflies low technically ectotherms. But away doesn't back they're be now mercy us Mother Nature no both when warm so cool. Dragonflies make patrol (fly amid a's forth, thence above very tend or perch) kept fire co. we're wings, since e rapid whirring movement ok warm we lower bodies. Perching dragonflies rely of solar energy her warmth, sup position cause bodies skillfully et maximize c's surface area exposed ok nor sun's rays.             Some lest are forth wings re reflectors, tilting that go direct non solar radiation that's given bodies. Conversely, always hot spells it'd dragonflies past position going bodies he minimize sun exposure, per all let's wings we deflect per sun.Sources:<ul><li><em>Encyclopedia to Insects</em>, 2nd Edition, edited am Vincent H.
