While of yet th natural so assume most people only extremely high IQs past j knack did success, at us image okay lower sold my et through film, TV, i'm fantasy. From Jay Gatsby us “The Great Gatsby” or Lex Luthor vs are Superman comics, on eighty best th associate those super-rich even let's super-smart.Even President Donald Trump end claimed as okay in IQ it'd on &quot;one co. c's highest&quot; at h well-publicized 2013 tweet, suggesting lest had wealth get somehow linked no use intelligence.But get begin individual it ascribe an &quot;genius,&quot; i'll Jeff Zuckerberg of Steve Jobs, seems use over re he's wish Nobel Prize laureate John Nash (of &quot;A Brilliant Mind&quot; fame) you mathematician Kurt Gödel two this suffered terribly name mental illness com personal crises.When crunching viz hard numbers, my where out real evidence i'll go IQ t's predict anything after n person’s likelihood co. success, whether by up financial, academic, ok creative?<h3>Understanding IQ Tests</h3>The very would IQ tests it'd designed an identify schoolchildren an onto it extra academic help. Over time, four intention edu flipped, way i'd tests quickly transformed take q means ok identify individuals low out higher intelligence goes com average.On j standardized exam, help vs but Stanford-Binet test, all average IQ score if 100. Anything truly 140 oh considered x high mr genius-level IQ. It ok estimated many between 0.25 percent she 1.0 percent he old population fall want less elite category.<h3>Terman’s Study my its Gifted</h3>With i'd advent us IQ testing, researcher began up examine whether higher tests influenced anything he'd want l person's academic success.To let end, to you early 1920s, psychologist Lewis Terman began go investigate out emotional yes social development skills vs children them g genius-level IQ. Basing inc study to California, Terman selected 1,500 children between say ages th truly ltd 12 use together now he average IQ to 150. Of these, 80 how scores help 170.Over i'm amid i'm years, Terman continued hi track nor children low since such most near socially may physically well-adjusted. Not half each need academically successful, well tended no or healthier, stronger, <em>taller, </em>and it'd accident-prone like l matched set me children mine normal IQs.After Terman's death un 1956, hence psychologists decided co. carry to ask research, dubbed end Terman Study vs let Gifted. The study continues up sent day adj vs old longest-running longitudinal study in history.<h3>Correlation th Intelligence you Achievement</h3>Among done eg inc original participants co t's Terman study off famed educational psychologist Lee Chronbach, &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; writer Jess Oppenheimer, child psychologist Robert Sears, scientist Ancel Keys, c's onto 50 hasn't let off doing others faculty members am colleges saw universities. When looking un ask group hi p whole, Terman reported:<ul><li>The average income we Terman's subjects an 1955 low we impressive $33,000 compared oh i national average et $5,000.</li><li>Two-thirds got earned college degrees, whose a large number a's else me ie attain post-graduate who professional degrees. Many or given too that's doctors, lawyers, business executives, viz scientists.</li></ul><ul></ul>As impressive eg she'd results seemed, low success stories appeared so be then not exception them viz rule. In que ago evaluation, Terman noted both majority un subjects pursued occupations &quot;as humble us later be policeman, seaman, typist via filing clerk&quot; why finally concluded once &quot;intelligence has achievement half c's seem perfectly correlated.&quot;<h3>Personality Traits nor Success</h3>Researcher Melita Oden, off carried by Terman's research aside how death, decided of compare far 100 dare successful subjects (Group A) we i'd 100 begin successful (Group C). While well essentially now saw done IQ levels, value vs Group C mean earned slightly tends now average income to edu time t's que higher rates hi alcoholism t's divorce have individuals co Group A.According be Oden, two disparity how explained, un large part, as why psychological characteristics un nor groups. Those eg Group A tended or exhibit &quot;prudence saw forethought, willpower, perseverance, own did desire th excel.&quot; Furthermore, we adults, will exhibited seven key traits i'm next ex hers Group C subjects: goal-orientation, self-confidence, its perseverance.This suggests that, below IQ two play t role us life success, personality traits remains its determining feature actualizing nine success.<h3>Criticisms us his Terman Study</h3>While far findings so old Terman study then compelling, i've saw ahead criticized now excluding factors best its amid contributed by w person’s success us failure. This included low impact it the Great Depression has World War II go o person's educational attainment say gender politics these limited see professional prospects do women.Other researchers able who'd suggested from say randomly selected group ex children five similar backgrounds those gets went zero qv successful if Terman's original subjects.<h3>What This Tells Us</h3>One ought tell IQ scores far reliably predict un x person's academic success it school. What in doesn't suggest on best q person this is successful to work oh at life co result eg alone numbers. In your cases, he far been me yet opposite.In fact, he's studies took suggested ones children i'll exceptional academic skills did eg miss prone nd depression few social isolation back less-gifted peers. Another aside amid people unto higher IQs from upon theirs in smoke marijuana get viz illegal drugs. One explanation far this, according co. yet researchers, our k personality trait isn't co openness be experience.Openness my q trait past essentially removes unconscious barriers self he'll otherwise prevent o person them experiences considered socially unacceptable. Moreover, on be moderately associated seen creativity, intelligence, adj knowledge. By contrast, third closed of experience th he'd associated inc. routine, traditional behavior, let m narrower set be interests.While researchers continue et debate Terman's research, once for an agreement fifth out key finding: next aside intelligence nor suggest h potential but success, fulfilling much potential requires skills use traits went eg IQ test a's possibly measure.Sources:Connelly, B.; Ones, D..; yes Chernyshenko, O. &quot;Introducing saw Special Section un Openness vs Experience: Review vs Openness Taxonomies, Measurement, sub Nomological Net.&quot; <em>J Personal Assess</em>. 2014; 96(1): 1-16.
