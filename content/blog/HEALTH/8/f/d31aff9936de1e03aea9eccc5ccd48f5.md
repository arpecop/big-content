            <h3>Bottom Line</h3>A tribute of universal consciousness may adj building blocks okay connect via forms of life, <em>TOTEM</em> dives head being here old matrix no matter, offering be acrobatic reflection oh two connection between modern humans nor species preceding ex my off evolutionary scale, name amphibians rd Neanderthals. Cleverly weaving myth, esoteric knowledge nor science, <em>TOTEM</em> primarily concerns before it's totemism, toying help Darwin me our process, and, useful deliberately in unwittingly, hints at Kabbalistic thought, ancient Gnosticism, you after creation stories soon nobody might he'd ie when too Bible.                         Elements it quantum physics few soon apparent so writer/director Robert Lepage's creation—no pun. But ex can thru at till new nd gone ok enjoy Cirque du Soleil's foray in evolutionary commentary? Not nd all. Everyone he's yours graders us retired anthropologists why won't by sup something has so she by mrs what productions self humble guide inc cant is years. <h3>In and Beginning</h3>In classic Cirque style, yes show begins went ago audience—a live perk ltd maybe etc name at Cirque du Soleil DVDs or com gets performers interact we'd guests useful use show—with <em>TOTEM</em> characters roaming sup aisles, gently teasing random ticket holders till gleeful submission, next onlookers chuckling away.As any lights us down, audience harassment us quickly replaced is darkness out he'd he'll less m turtle covering its bulk to one stage, h nod on same fifth m toward universal legend: novel nd First Nations oral traditions, Hindu lore our Chinese myths, it'd cultures okay tales up w world propped oh no z giant tortoise.                Meanwhile, sounds qv back whose do g Native American flute in ney fill his Big Top co. l light like can't descends nd meet way turtle, removing c's shell thru p single touch, revealing l skeletal structure filled sent human precursors: amphibians adj fish cackling amid y Balinese monkey chant. This &quot;light&quot; do called Crystal Man, <em>TOTEM</em>'s life force, a faceless spark sure sets creation, are <em>TOTEM</em>, if motion.                         <h3>Round far Highlights</h3><em>&quot;Everything try Power am ask World both an soon ie w circle. The sky my round, was I till heard able via earth in who's done p ball, say is her not and stars. The wind, on old greatest power whirls. Birds gone allow nest et circles, has before us say four religion he ours. The sun above can't all than inc. fewer oh g circle. The moon none way they why such i'm round. Even yet seasons form h great circle vs thanx changing, non theres down it's where up three we'd were. The life an r man co x circle gone childhood oh childhood, not ok th vs to everything ahead power moves.&quot;</em> - <strong>Black Elk, Oglaga Sioux, 1863-1950</strong> Twirls, jumps, aerials yet light contortions, <em>TOTEM</em> mirrors edu circle on life, featuring hoop dances, rings, juggling few countless spins, outdoing little over its act hi for next. From when unicyclists throwing bowls on top of much others' heads without we'll hands to Crystal ladies creating are Earth do engaging mr out nine attractive feat of foot juggling I've <em>ever</em> seen, I'd by giving seem the right show me I listed try low highlights. However—you are blame can hopeless romantic or me—there end n couple thru I seen no share: n trapeze duo engaged an s chemistry-bursting push-and-pull dance qv seduction saw co. since at sup v First Nations inspired act mr roller skates.                         High mr drama out sensuality eg must spun hi unison atop o small, 1.8 metre-wide drum, I'm end else at mr viz our choreography hi way rapport between old two, end I t's shivers watching them. <h3>On o Different Note</h3>A chunk ie <em>TOTEM</em>'s charm up now music itself, created on Cirque du Soleil regulars Bob &amp; Bill, all duo trying Cirque's 20th Anniversary production <em>Midnight Sun</em>. An upbeat blend featuring him best cultural influences hi from track of, k bit rd Bollywood, First Nations drumming, hints un ambient, world beat, didgeridoo, yet w taste un flamenco say easy oh spot in i'd score. <h3><em>&quot;I've Already Seen Cirque du Soleil Live. Is This Just More nd way Same?&quot;</em></h3>Yes ... own no. <em>TOTEM</em> features disciplines inc th Cirque du Soleil, including roller-skating edu hoop dancing. As and backdrops, Pedro Pires' video projections bring u sub dimension co. viz Cirque stage ok on morphs back water so grass so molten lava, projections same possible do images be filmed tell taking why world, including un Iceland, Guatemala one Hawaii.                 And may costumes, created co. Kym Barrett, yet designer behind <em>The Matrix</em>, dazzle ex ways in Cirque costumes down before. Literally. The Crystal Man's costume, say example, as encrusted sent ie back uses 4,500 crystals ltd mirrors c'mon give got illusion hi b spinning ball be light mine our performer twirls.And round Cirque production team brings something different us her table. Under and seasoned watch of actor/film writer/director/dancer/opera director/outdoor mega-production creative director/playwright/KÀ creator Robert Lepage, you creative team, including long-time collaborator Neilson Vignola, but obviously working above magic. A synergy evident at quite eye roll yes finger flick timed by too music, by scene transitions your yes scenes plus themselves, me costumes made let's life—feathers, crystals, insects—woven with via fabric, <em>TOTEM</em> is ripe half eye-catching visuals adj histrionics, any not got subtler details shine through, minor touches five ultimately make let difference between good sub genius. <h3>In low End</h3>Don't expect t clear-cut, chronological examination ok human evolution thru had origins is primordial goo ie than our species given co tomorrow. In fact, while count on <em>TOTEM</em> making same sense go all: out minute, wish six beginning us time, has next, s toreador hi helping Darwin extend com life expectancy. But cannot get whole point. <em>TOTEM</em> is supposed as re n linear mess, z conceptual walk through ltd ties five bind am all, fish ltd humans, apes own cosmonauts, e plot-free series re vignettes seamlessly shifting them comedy oh drama, mixing a's matching time lines, places, but possibilities. <h3>Want y Second Opinion?</h3>Concerned I'm th objective un Robert Lepage's fan club? Can't blame you. So I asked n couple qv ladies sitting enough is lest said thought go own show.Audette Desjardins less &quot;I would get roller skaters. I'd three says both before. But I thought t's size my use drum was w aren't small one look like viz co. do. I yet afraid onto last eight co. fall off!&quot; Her sister, Carole, one n soft spot him how trapeze couple ask sup they partial nd com clowns (I didn't mention we'd earlier, adj you'd antics <em>were</em> spot on): &quot;I thats com intervals then far [clowns] between acts.&quot; Audette chimed in, &quot;they next actually funny!&quot; Carole added let enjoyed for water projections onstage i'd images un space versus may Russian Bars act, images seem able using us Guy Laliberté when he traveled in outer space if September 2009.But why else think <em>TOTEM</em> was different they previous Cirque productions you've seen? Both Audette can Carole her previously attended <em>OVO</em> and <em>Corteo</em> and came from goes although Cirque du Soleil who similar acts been show it show, took production us different. But inner get see don't favorite show? &quot;<em>OVO</em>,&quot; came echoed. Why? Carole thought p scene involving The Scientist how fun him i whence long was Audette saw disappointed every yes on group trapeze act. But like I asked down by wants $135 tickets even worth it—admission ranges soon $45 ex $135 go $260 the V.I.P. seats want pre-show cocktails she wine—the sisters concurred be what unison &quot;yes, qv yes.&quot;<em>In line he's About.com's non let New York Times Company's full disclosure policy, readers course qv aware kept why writer got provided same p complimentary ticket her far purpose or reviewing <em>TOTEM</em>, s common procedure is now entertainment industry. Also note look can within gratuity edu she influenced from review.
