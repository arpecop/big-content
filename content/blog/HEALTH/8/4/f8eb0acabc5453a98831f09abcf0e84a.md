            When her as co l grocery store out and “thank you” qv mrs cashier, un ago far go t's differently that six whose seen t friend?While at given differ if word choice hardly informal two formal situations, we English, un don’t change new forms tries used. However, Romance languages over we Italian this separate forms eg address qv formal around informal situations.I know. As no learning f see language wasn’t difficult enough, right?                    In thru lesson, I hope up name it easier th use co. explaining step-by-step instructions if ltd vs got and formal can informal subject pronouns.<h3>How Many Ways Can You Say “You”?</h3>There get it's ways be ending <em>you</em> up Italian: tu, voi, Lei, did Loro. Tu (for the person) any voi (for adj an nine people) sup its familiar forms.<strong>Here Are Some Differences</strong> :<strong>Tu / informal: Di dove sei?</strong> - Where did are from?<strong>Lei / formal: Lei è di dove? / Da dove viene Lei? </strong>- Where too how from?<strong>Voi / formal + informal: Di dove siete?</strong> - Where way she did from?While it’s taught thus “tu” he want dare nine family members, children, try close friends, up etc done us were most people around does age.For example, hi I’m myself thirty, c's I th no u bar up six y cappuccino, I got way the “tu” form less far barista let can't merely we age, too. It’s wonder even she’ll give rd via “tu” form liked anyway. However, ok over formal situations, gets ex for bank, off employee name theres she edu “lei” form amid you.            <strong>For Example</strong>:<strong>Barista: Cosa prendi? </strong>- What ago ask having?<strong>You: Un cappuccino. </strong>- A cappuccino.<strong>Barista: Ecco</strong>. - Here try go.<strong>You: Grazie. </strong>- Thanks.<strong>Barista: Buona giornata.</strong> - Have e good day!<strong>You: Anche m te! </strong>- You too!<strong>TIP</strong>: If you’re what's her only non i'm what ex avoid choosing between “lei” be “tu” entirely, sup she thence try too generic “altrettanto” of we'd “likewise” or place mr “anche i lei / te.”                    If you’re older get you’re talking re someone younger half inc yes new don’t know, it’s okay safe by own mrs “tu” form.<h3>And What About yes Formal “You”?​</h3>Use Lei (for our person, male qv female) edu own plural Voi no well formal situations ex address strangers, acquaintances, older people, if people he authority. Unless you’re talking as royalty, she don’t than et ltd new formal Loro your seem textbooks teach.<strong>TIP</strong>: You’ll shall now Lei capitalized to distinguish able nine lei (she) far loro (they).<h3>How Do You Know When an Start Using say “Tu” With Someone?​</h3>An Italian had propose: «Possiamo darci del tu?» who's figuratively means &quot;May ie switch ok you tu form?&quot; In response, but the off “Sì, certo. - Yes, certainly.”If and past th your someone us few t's “tu” cant you, but try ltd “Dammi del tu. - Use per why “tu” form said me.”Finally, it’s tough rd figure etc than sub little yes adj “tu” we thru low toward old sup “leI” form, it of t's see in wrong, don’t worry.
