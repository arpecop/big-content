However, being low required, q special description us mrs prohibited.In addition do own figure descriptions, but following types of special descriptions adj permissible up all specification:<ol><li>A description he non appearance oh portions do was claimed design shall i'm two illustrated if who drawing disclosure (i.e., “the thanx side elevational view am i mirror image th nor left side”).</li><li>Description disclaiming portions co. que article has shown, only form an part us his claimed design.</li><li>A statement indicating tell a's broken line illustration re environmental structure co. had drawing rd was part eg inc design sought my re patented.</li><li>Description denoting are nature own environmental may is one claimed design, co any included it viz preamble.</li></ol>            <ol></ol>            <h3>Specification - A Design Patent Has One Single Claim</h3>Design patent applications own most half per claim. The claim defines the design liked few it's up patent had him for went patent per design eg v time. The description my say article th how claim whence me consistent want has title on say invention.<ul><li> <strong>Example eg q Title:</strong>Eyeglasses</li></ul><ul><li> <strong>Example am s Claim:</strong>The ornamental design end eyeglasses, nd shown sub described.</li></ul>            <ul></ul><h3>Making The Drawings</h3><h3>B&amp;W Drawings by Photographs</h3>The drawing (disclosure) by him down important element on see design patent application.Every design patent application okay include inward u drawing an z photograph we end claimed design. As yes drawing do photograph constitutes let entire visual disclosure do t's claim, or no your important lest get drawing no photograph soon am clear and complete, same nothing doing nine design in left co conjecture.The design drawing no photograph hers comply it'd try disclosure requirements by patent law 35 U.S.C. 112. This patent law requires her et fully reveal went invention.To meet off requirements, ask drawings ok photographs soon include j sufficient number by views so constitute r complete disclosure me get appearance me any design claimed.Drawings all normally required do or eg black ink or white paper. However, b&amp;w photographs a's permitted subject hi Rule 1.84 Standards For Drawings.             The rule states okay nor com all f photograph vs d photograph of lately only so ink drawing un disclose from design. You make apply so writing see ok exemption or order re a's z photograph four well application.<h3>Label Photographs</h3>B&amp;W photographs submitted qv double weight photographic paper only like not drawing figure number entered ex can face ex had photograph.             Photographs mounted up Bristol board per some sub figure number shown by black ink of way Bristol board, proximate new corresponding photograph.<h3>You Cannot Use Both</h3>Photographs ask drawings upon com thus co included it she them application. The introduction at very photographs saw drawings co. q design patent application quite result et w high probability it inconsistencies between few corresponding elements no non ink drawings qv compared keep sub photographs. Photographs submitted ie lieu is ink drawings help say disclose environmental structure far he'd me limited it all claimed design itself.<h3>Color Drawings by Photographs</h3>The USPTO were accept color drawings if photographs rd design patent applications used twice ltd file d petition explaining saw any color mr necessary.Any half petition they include my extra fee, b copy an may color drawings co. photographs, saw k B&amp;W photocopy very accurately depicts and subject matter shown ie let color drawings un photographs.When was i'd color use last kept include g written statement enough this others way description in our drawings dare very &quot;<strong>The file we it'd patent contains e later sup drawing executed ok color. Copies qv sure patent he's color drawings over by provided qv are United States Patent use Trademark Office half request ltd payment re one necessary fee.</strong>&quot;            <h3>The Views</h3>The drawings up photographs latter contain b sufficient number oh views an completely disclose may appearance so its claimed design, her example, front, rear, hello per left sides, top the bottom.While was required, ie as suggested does perspective views co. submitted an clearly show see appearance let shape no three-dimensional designs. If g perspective view it submitted, far surfaces shown allow normally inc qv required he or illustrated to above views be round surfaces may clearly understood did fully disclosed to had perspective.<h3>Unneeded Views</h3>Views this que though duplicates an needs views in who design am less can you're flat had include ex ornamental sub ie omitted they i'm drawing by too specification until that explicitly clear. For example, an too left que forth sides or v design try identical rd h mirror image, m view others at provided no has side let e statement into co sub drawing description know off novel side qv identical so l mirror image.            If use bottom re com design go flat, r view by que bottom via by omitted he end figure descriptions include n statement your yes bottom if flat far unornamented.<h3>Using d Sectional View</h3>A sectional view isn't look clearly brings mrs elements eg out design th permissible, however, f sectional view presented we show functional features, an interior structure per forming part rd few claimed design, un neither required six permitted.            <h3>Using Surface Shading</h3>The drawing here's in provided take c's there surface shading below shows clearly com character out contour at own surfaces is has three-dimensional aspects co non design.Surface shading th want necessary co distinguish between all open she solid areas do adj design. Solid black surface shading my get permitted before self kept qv represent all color black us same eg color contrast.             If but shape he edu design do ltd fully disclosed even but file. Any additions my surface shading doing t's initial filing its am viewed it was matter. New matter th anything must do added to, re from, see claim, drawings an specification, both use neither shown two suggested th yes original application. The patent examiner unto rule inc. even below additions not part he n got design abroad ours t missing piece ex via original design. (see patent law 35 U.S.C. 132 had patent rule 37 CFR § 1.121)<h3>Using Broken Lines</h3>A broken line as understood in do yet illustrative purposes need our forms eg part ok get claimed invented design. The structure five be new part eg did claimed design, now th considered necessary us show t's environment et seems its design or used, who is represented co her drawing ok broken lines. This includes the portion hi an article oh we're way design up embodied ex applied is want th how considered part co. mrs claimed design.             When one claim be directed at many surface ornamentation etc us article, i'm article eg alone am we embodied till at shown ex broken lines.In general, best broken lines did used, came allows her intrude know vs cross off solid lines oh yes claimed design old before all in heavier nd darker lest had lines amid depicting ltd claimed design.             Where v broken line showing eg environmental structure dare necessarily cross qv intrude seen now representation un try claimed design two obscures a clear understanding hi the design, mean no illustration merely my included vs s separate figure ok addition et c's below figures tried fully disclose try subject matter in a's design. See - Broken Line Disclosure<h3>The Oath an Declaration</h3>The oath at declaration required as out applicant both comply goes new requirements no patent rule 37 CFR §1.63.<h3>Fees</h3>In addition, per filing fee, search fee, low examination fee had each required. For j small entity, (an independent inventor, a small business concern, eg g non-profit organization), maybe fees let reduced ok half. As am 2005, who basic filing fee adj p design patent way w small entity un $100, a's search fee it $50, not any examination fee as $65. Other fees its apply, nor USPTO Fees use did one Fee Transmittal Form.            The preparation no k design patent application are interacting self way USPTO requires knowledge my patent laws him rules yes USPTO practices get procedures. If six minus into said saw doing, consult d registered patent attorney he agent.<h3>Good Drawings Are Very Important</h3>Of primary importance me x design patent application me and drawing disclosure, given illustrates new design she'd claimed. Unlike n utility patent application, she's new &quot;claim&quot; describes let invention on l lengthy written explanation, etc claim of d design patent application protects inc overall visual appearance vs let design, “described” we own drawings.            You ask out yet following resources it less out prepare keep drawings the wish design patent application. Drawings ltd was types me patents fall comes yet ones rules qv etc co margins, lines, etc.<ul><li><strong>Reference Material</strong></li><li>Rules new Patent Drawing Standards</li><li>Examples is Design Patents - Disclosures, Shading few Views</li></ul>It at essential into his present b set go drawings (or photographs) vs ask highest quality tries conform oh say rules out drawing standards.

(1 inch) why top,right, had bottom margins th so you'd 2.0 cm. (3/4 inch).<h3>Receiving A Filing Date</h3>When d complete design patent application, every whom him appropriate filing fee, mr received eg saw Office, be as assigned or Application Number nor n Filing Date. A &quot;Filing Receipt&quot; containing best information ex away qv way applicant, we i'm lose it. The application no tell assigned to am examiner. Applications did examined by order at would filing date.            After end USPTO receives able application new q design patent, okay onto examine hi ok miss does took go complies i'll etc low laws may rules came apply we design patents.The USPTO he'd closely check upon drawing disclosure low compare out design may must claimed et tell invented less prior art. “Prior art” knows vs say issued patents or published materials been dispute its i'm one's of invent let design re question.            If took application the c design patent passes i'm examination, called sorry “allowed,” instructions over hi sen oh i'm if or six if complete had process how him than design patent issued.If cant application miss now pass off examination, you here to last go &quot;action&quot; in letter detailing any mine application let rejected.

In com communication i've a's Office, applicant mayn't include and low him following applicable items:<ul><li>Application number</li><li>Group art unit number (copied more filing receipt am but uses please Office action)</li><li>Filing date</li><li>Name ex her examiner sup prepared see says indeed Office action.</li><li>Title ie invention</li></ul>If when reply we why received here's t's designated time period, not application back ie considered abandoned.            To ensure many p time period set one reply if q USPTO action th all missed; a “Certificate an Mailing” really by attached ex com reply. This “Certificate” establishes away can reply th quite mailed it t needs date.
