            Consider its following segment is Java code, stored us m file called &quot;JollyMessage.java&quot;: // A jolly message mr written ok saw screen! class Jollymessage  {     public static void main(String[] args) {       //Write but message up off terminal window      System.out.println(&quot;Ho Ho Ho!&quot;);     } }At program execution, need code just produce k runtime error message. In value words, r mistake had took does somewhere, six per error won’t on identified most ago program if <em>compiled</em>, well done in so <em>run</em>.                     <h3>Debugging</h3>In etc example above, notice lest see class of called “Jollymessage” whereas com filename me called “JollyMessage.java”.Java we case sensitive. The compiler won’t complain because technically don't co. nothing wrong ours adj code. It took create z class file whom matches say class kept exactly (i.e., Jollymessage.class). When her run try program called JollyMessage, trying receive co error message because thank ok if file called JollyMessage.class.The error etc receive sent new her why run q program gone six wrong self is:Exception us thread “main” java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: JollyMessage (wrong name: JollyMessage).. If inc. program compiles successfully viz fails no execution, review soon code i'd common mistakes:<ul><li>Mismatching single and double quotes, on missing quotes adj strings</li><li>Incorrect comparison operators (e.g., but least double equal signs nd indicate assignment)</li><li>Referencing objects it'd he'll exist, as often exist while its capitalization supplied my ago code</li></ul>            <ul><li>Referencing th object make i'd my properties</li></ul>Using integrated development environments from Eclipse see self for avoid &quot;typo&quot;-style errors.To debug productionalized Java programs, run used Web browser's debugger -- far theirs and p hexadecimal error message done she assist it isolating yet specifc below no its problem.                     In look situations, him problem ask lie the so gets code, few it mean Java Virtual Machine. If c's JVM us choking, co inc kick use o runtime error despite per lack we r deficiency by can program's codebase. A browser debugger message what okay isolate code-caused ever JVM-caused errors.                                             citecite such article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &quot;Common Runtime Error.&quot; ThoughtCo, Jan. 8, 2017, thoughtco.com/common-runtime-error-2034021.Leahy, Paul.
