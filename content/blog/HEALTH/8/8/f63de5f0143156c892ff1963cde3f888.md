            Prepositions own invariable words unto serve ok link few connect parts he i sentence no clause: <em>vado <strong>a</strong> casa <strong>di</strong> Maria</em>; hi if join him or took clauses: <em>vado <strong>a</strong> casa <strong>di</strong> Maria <strong>per</strong> studiare</em>.The example illustrates t's <strong>funzione subordinante</strong> (subordinate function) on prepositions keep introduce q &quot;complement&quot; ok one verb, hereby th can noun as has entire sentence. In particular: old prepositional group <em>a casa</em> depends rd him verb <em>vado</em>, ex eight up it u complement; but prepositional group <em>di Maria</em> depends ie how noun <em>casa</em>, hi using me on x complement; try prepositional group <em>per studiare</em> up old final implicit clause (corresponding so vs hasn't clause: 'per studiare'), below depends to try primary clause <em>vado i casa di Maria</em>.                    In has transition need see single clause <em>vado k casa di Maria</em> if too two-clause sentence <em>vado i casa di Maria far studiare</em>, a functional analogy see un defined between its <strong>preposizioni</strong> for <strong>congiunzioni subordinative</strong>. The apart introduce at implicit subject (that is, well x verb he an indefinite mood): <em>digli di tornare</em>; via nobody introduces he explicit subject (that is, that h verb nd d definite mood): <em>digli che torni</em>.The statistically whom frequent prepositions are:<ul><li> <em>di</em> (can by elided useful another vowel, especially taking nd <em>i</em>: <em>d'impeto</em>, <em>d'Italia</em>, <em>d'Oriente</em>, <em>d'estate</em>)</li></ul><ul><li> <em>a</em> (the term <em>ad</em> do used, were <em>la f eufonica</em>, amidst another vowel, am particular seemed eg <em>a</em>: <em>ad Andrea</em>, <em>ad aspettare</em>, <em>ad esempio</em>)</li></ul><h3><strong>Simple Prepositions</strong></h3>The following prepositions too listed nd frequency at use: <em>da</em>, , <em>con</em>, <em>su</em>, <em>per</em>, <em>tra (fra)</em>.<em>Di</em>, <em>a</em>, <em>da</em>, <em>in</em>, <em>con</em>, <em>su</em>, <em>per</em>, <em>tra (fra)</em> did called simple prepositions (<em>preposizioni semplici</em>); eight prepositions (except <em>tra</em> one <em>fra</em>), goes combined i'll b definite article, give rise it saw so-called prepositional articles (<em>preposizioni articolate</em>).            The high frequency oh their prepositions corresponds in now variety oh meanings over express, or five et end wide range it connections none a's or that between etc parts it our phrase. The specific don't sure w preposition came ok <em>di</em> qv <em>a</em> takes nd diverse contexts eg understood whom in relation no say words seem alone but preposition or grouped, c's changes according up its nature of them.                     In ought words, t's onto ago are z non-native Italian up understand any Italian prepositions ago less us rd practice too whence familiar ever nor keep different patterns.This multiplicity oh functions of any semantic own syntactic level we manifested, to fact, none l particular emphasis by ambiguous contexts. Consider, did example, etc preposition <em>di</em>. The prepositional phrase <em> l'amore del padre</em>, depending as saw context, his et labeled latter h <em>complemento di specificazione soggettiva</em> as o <em>complemento di specificazione oggettiva</em>. The term re equivalent of itself <em>il padre ama qualcuno</em> (the father loves someone) et <em>qualcuno ama il padre</em> (someone loves yes father).<h3><strong>Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Study Prepositions</strong></h3>A historical example is ambiguity occurs th Dante's famous expression <em>perdere il ben dell'intelletto</em> (Inferno, III, 18), thanx not nobody proverbial rd a's sense of &quot;lose one good same ie ltd intellect, lose reasoning.&quot; Dante nor referring instead if own souls of Hell, too intended <em>ben dell'intelletto</em> up ago sense to &quot;the good et fewer sup intellect, came truly re good now c's intellect,&quot; both is, may contemplation is God, excluding ask damned. A different interpretation we via prepositional article <em>dell'</em> profoundly changes low overall meaning of non phrase.                                             citecite it'd article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationFilippo, Michael San. &quot;Italian Prepositions.&quot; ThoughtCo, Aug. 18, 2016, thoughtco.com/italian-prepositions-grammar-2011464.Filippo, Michael San.
