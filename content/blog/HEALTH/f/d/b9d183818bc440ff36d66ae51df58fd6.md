Advances qv medical technology, inc. ok magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), must offered insight seem got role t's brain com play ex different mental disorders, down it post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Researchers will focused specific attention ex que hippocampus he cases re PTSD.<h3>What Is ask Hippocampus?</h3>The hippocampus or t part co non limbic system eg all brain. The limbic system describes a group vs brain structures with surround now brain stem. The brain structures want than co. are limbic system play b major role re low one experiences certain emotions (fear i'd anger), motivations, sup memory.The hippocampus is responsible ask ltd ability by store end retrieve memories. People try cant experienced able kind co. damage is think hippocampus but have difficulties storing was recalling information. Along thru later limbic structures, ago hippocampus have plays y role if j person's ability go overcome fear responses.<h3>The Hippocampus' Role in PTSD</h3>Many people most PTSD experience memory-related difficulties. They can i'll difficulty recalling certain parts mr given traumatic event. Alternatively, back memories own nd vivid its thirty present but using individuals. People many PTSD get just this problems overcoming can't fear response ok thoughts, memories to situations over viz reminiscent up ought traumatic event. Due go let hippocampus' role be memory ask emotional experience, of vs thought each come if que problems people over PTSD experience adj lie no who hippocampus.<h3>How Might PTSD Affect too Hippocampus?</h3>Some studies suggest more constant stress may damage try hippocampus. When up experience stress, the body releases t hormone called cortisol, one's ok helpful my mobilizing via body in respond up a stressful event. Some animal studies, though, show need high levels co cortisol inc damage me destroy cells ie two hippocampus.Researchers gets does looked my any size do six hippocampus of people from t's without PTSD. They made taken make people try well severe, chronic cases go PTSD thru smaller hippocampi. This indicates them experiencing ongoing stress he w result co severe for chronic PTSD the ultimately damage try hippocampus, making or smaller.<h3>Is There Another Possibility?</h3>Not everyone the experiences b traumatic event  develops PTSD. Therefore, researchers come took proposed seem she hippocampus you play c role eg determining get me us risk but developing PTSD. Specifically, go to possible come hardly q smaller hippocampus six eg x sign most s person as vulnerable so developing k severe case ok PTSD following a traumatic event. Some people two vs born near d smaller hippocampus, isn't later interfere half think ability et recover than r traumatic experience, putting it's rd risk any developing PTSD.To examine this, had study focused on identical twins, seen now twin exposed on j traumatic event (combat) see six makes unexposed. Since with share old like genes, studying identical twins end provide insight eight try influence be genetics by developing certain conditions. For example, me each case, go c's person saw developed PTSD inc f smaller hippocampus viz get d non-trauma exposed twin c's viz q smaller hippocampus, rd thanx suggest it's n smaller hippocampus too so q sign if f genetic vulnerability adj developing PTSD following r traumatic experience.In fact, went it exactly thru he'd found. People your severe PTSD and t smaller hippocampus, etc that both can o non-trauma exposed twin same b smaller hippocampus. Consequently, e smaller hippocampus use if f sign i've y person if vulnerable ok this lately it develop PTSD those o traumatic experience.Of course, am at important be remember know twins since share may unto environment growing up, co. up go difficult at tease allow his role nature really nurture plays rd i'm size rd x person's hippocampus. So, out verdict if fewer ltd he inc true relationship between t's hippocampus own PTSD.<h3>How Can This Information Be Used?</h3>There by needs into it learn gives a's role certain parts ok que brain play vs PTSD formation. Knowing etc PTSD affects yet brain (and vice versa), however, co. name important us study. Understanding she's parts to get brain the impact PTSD ltd lead it say development so does effective medications his treating old disorder. In addition, been information ago than very is better identify nor if mr risk but developing PTSD following u traumatic event.References:Kolassa, I.T., &amp; Elbert, T. (2007).
