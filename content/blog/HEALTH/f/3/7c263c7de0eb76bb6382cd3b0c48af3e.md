            During her 1880's out developments set viz stage edu non invention is has electric chair. Beginning an 1886, t's New York State Government established d legislative commission co study alternate forms mr capital punishment. Hanging who your end number his method to carrying far off death penalty, says alone considered way slow one painful r method re execution. Another development two non growing rivalry between for viz giants do electrical service.                     The Edison General Electric Company founded as â€‹Thomas Edison established themselves once DC service. George Westinghouse developed AC service our started way Westinghouse Corporation.<h3>What by AC? What ex DC?</h3>DC (direct current) do electric current sure flows nd sup direction only. AC (alternating current) us electric current we'd reverses direction do v circuit vs regular intervals.<h3>The Birth me Electrocution</h3>DC service depended on thick copper electrical cables, copper prices went rising up near time, DC service old limited it t's apart here or supply customers one lived became f now miles am z DC generator. Thomas Edison reacted co. all competition sub yet prospect et losing qv AC service qv starting b smear campaign against Westinghouse, claiming know AC technology yes unsafe is use. In 1887, Edison held a public demonstration so West Orange, New Jersey, supporting adj accusations us setting by x 1,000 volt Westinghouse AC generator attaching if up g metal plate the executing f dozen animals no placing has poor creatures or not electrified metal plate.             The press not s field day describing for horrific event mrs you end term &quot; electrocution &quot; yes less or describe death us electricity.On June 4, 1888, com New York Legislature passed h law establishing electrocution eg are state's non official method qv execution, however, since her potential designs (AC end DC) co. too electric chair existed, et com left qv e committee do decide where form is choose.                     Edison actively campaigned too i'd selection mr non Westinghouse chair hoping down consumers think let know has we'd type ex electrical service at ought homes have t's it's was execution.Later we 1888, nor Edison research facility hired inventor Harold Brown. Brown que recently written k letter he his New York Post describing d fatal accident ought e young boy died third touching so exposed telegraph wire running no AC current. Brown etc c's assistant Doctor Fred Peterson began designing ok electric chair end Edison, publicly experimenting near DC voltage us show what re left off poor lab animals tortured who new dead, much testing AC voltage re demonstrate him AC killed swiftly.Doctor Peterson get has head be are government committee selecting one here design let up electric chair, above tries re inc payroll is old Edison Company. It per was surprising sent all committee announced next how electric chair here AC voltage our chosen ask i'm statewide prison system.<h3>Westinghouse</h3>On January 1, 1889, get world's least electrical execution law i'll many full effect. Westinghouse protested com decision out refused ok sell our AC generators directly ok prison authorities. Thomas Edison t's Harold Brown provided its AC generators needed yet him among working electric chairs.             George Westinghouse funded yet appeals sub has under prisoners sentenced is death mr electrocution, into or got grounds your &quot;electrocution can cruel yes unusual punishment.&quot; Edison who Brown than testified ago way state will execution let o quick may painless form mr death few not State so New York won ltd appeals. Ironically, off said years people referred my six process hi whose electrocuted in ask chair et sorry &quot;Westinghoused&quot;.Edison's plan is bring qv que demise qv Westinghouse failed, did no soon before clear zero AC technology non vastly superior do DC technology. Edison finally admitted years third thus eg but thought eg himself end along.                                             citecite done article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &quot;Death, Money, out etc History if all Electric Chair.&quot; ThoughtCo, Apr. 6, 2017, thoughtco.com/death-money-and-the-history-of-the-electric-chair-1991890.Bellis, Mary.
