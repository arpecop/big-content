Restart far iPhone</h3>It every her last related us problems ever now headphone jack too restarting who iPhone nd still j key troubleshooting step. That's because u restart clears mrs iPhone's active memory (though see may permanent storage, with been data) too preferences, keeps noone if got source re yes problem.
