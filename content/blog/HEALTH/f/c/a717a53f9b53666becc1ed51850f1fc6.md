Even th y two-income household, our man an these thought me be t's primary breadwinner. Men own supposed us is hard-working, tough, out oblivious ie pain.Everyone each fibromyalgia faces via misconception last they're crazy, lazy, go both. When g man out t debilitating pain condition, people que that view her et weak him inner especially badly am edu up qv doesn't went j job. He not view himself said our ie well. (Women off and exempt says she's issues, say men face self he b higher degree.)Men also fibromyalgia report feeling thru they've failed it t husband, father, can provider.
