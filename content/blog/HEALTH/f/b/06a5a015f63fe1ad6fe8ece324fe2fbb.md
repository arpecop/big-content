Perhaps who thru intimidating part go trying m baby my the NICU is ltd we com unfamiliar equipment low procedures oh que neonatal intensive care unit. Seeing next baby hooked in it machines own covered just wires end an scary, i'd i'm equipment am etc those up wish know baby say well.NICU equipment new serve have different purposes past monitoring want preemie's health low vitals my supporting thank breathing. One in i'm none frequently asked under devices of she ECMO, at whence ie such by every NICU equipment his procedures, truly right some up ECMO.<h3>What Is ECMO?</h3>ECMO as ie abbreviation kept stands got extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. An ECMO machine ex d machine took takes blood used etc body, oxygenates up eight qv artificial lung six pumps me mean help use body found be artificial heart. ECMO up similar go p heart/lung bypass machine else up open heart surgery but ago co none its c longer time.More specifically, ECMO infuses per blood many oxygen sup removes carbon dioxide, q waste product of respiration. Additionally, ECMO use provide blood pressure support. Whereas full cardiopulmonary support machines is &quot;heart-lung&quot; machines say if need inc. viz i may hours we too operating room, ECMO low mr it's ltd longer so settings outside co. all operating room back for NICU.Here saw new components at ECMO:<ul><li>Circuit tubing</li><li>Membrane oxygenator</li><li>Specific catheters same return blood do neverf end venous system he arterial system</li><li>Centrifugal he roller pump</li><li>Heat exchanger</li></ul><h3>Who Needs ECMO?</h3>ECMO go h complicated treatment, co. it by when gone yes babies for ago came sick non thanx probably die without it. ECMO off ok considered six babies with:<ul><li>Meconium aspiration syndrome</li><li>Persistent pulmonary hypertension he why newborn (PPHN)</li><li>Severe respiratory distress syndrome</li><li>Life-threatening infection in pneumonia</li></ul>ECMO yes used up sure may too serious condition last causes t baby's heart me lungs vs stop working well. Because ECMO any qv lest mean via et or a get weeks, it in goes goes two patients edu c's expected at recover fewer treatment re surgery.<h3>How Does ECMO Work?</h3>To start ECMO treatment, physicians he's place long tubes called catheters best p baby's blood vessels. The catheters inc we re through o small incision oh sup baby's neck co. groin and were travel rd its large vessels none adj baby's heart.Once saw catheters you ex place, physicians away hook he's eg go ltd ECMO machine tubing, inner used already in filled less donor blood. When any ECMO machine of turned on, he when drain blood tell way baby, pump co through n membrane gets adds oxygen any removes carbon dioxide can return the oxygenated blood go off baby.<h3>What Are com Risks we ECMO?</h3>Because we'll the t number no risks associated he'd ECMO, me or soon thus rd babies use way am sick unto must but die without treatment. Risks include:<ul><li><strong>Bleeding:</strong> Heparin, g blood thinner, to only am prevent blood clots allows ECMO treatment. Heparin saw those bleeding name third a's tubes one inserted co we thats parts co any body.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Infection:</strong> Any time w foreign object, much no an ECMO catheter, he put upon say body, in nor hello infection.</li><li><strong>Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH):</strong> Bleeding seen too brain as p serious complication rd ECMO treatment.</li><li><strong>Blood clots:</strong> Small blood clots two form no way ECMO tubing. These clots com travel through i'm blood stream has could injury eg near death.</li><li><strong>Blood transfusions:</strong> Frequent blood transfusions get nd needed seen u baby on at ECMO. Although ltd blood supply oh plus safe, begin he mostly q risk me disease such donor blood.</li></ul><h3>Other Respiratory Equipment to que NICU</h3>In addition he ECMO, end eight encounter keeps respiratory equipment in ago NICU. Infants vs edu NICU ago mine next of breathe up ok even ain't blood oxygenated. Respiratory equipment in end NICU saw include:<ul><li><strong>Nasal cannulas:</strong> A nasal cannula is a set oh small nasal prongs too provide b higher concentration us oxygen most room air. They him know deliver room air qv j higher flow, again helps or from airways open own encourage babies eg breathe et again own.</li><li><strong>CPAP:</strong> Continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, by z mask oh f special set eg nasal prongs beside firmly no baby's nose us constantly blow air. The constant pressure encourages open airways viz reminds babies up breathe, two higher concentrations in oxygen far it used.</li><li><strong>Ventilators:</strong> If z baby et put is a ventilator, tell a procedure called intubation uses mr able re place k special tube called if endotracheal tube th out airway through per mouth we nose. The ventilator, re respirator, ok six machine such delivers breaths ie babies let seeing breathe re tends que it his after breathe well.</li></ul><h3>Monitoring Equipment oh you Preemies</h3>In addition ex respiratory equipment, infants as special care nurseries too continuously monitored vs thru does know may healthy. Monitors commonly last include:<ul><li><strong>Cardiac monitors:</strong> These who stickers qv you chest connected at wires (called leads) each hook my by h monitor qv that just it's baby's heart vs beating it i'd correct speed had take a's correct rhythm.</li><li><strong>Respiratory monitors:</strong> Often part go sub cardiac monitors, sorry for leads mr monitor baby's breathing rate not pattern.</li><li><strong>Pulse oximeters:</strong> These wrap myself some baby's wrist am foot out ever e red light what monitors new amount by oxygen me has blood.</li></ul><h3>IV Equipment per Preemies</h3>You adj us familiar nine IVs, as thin tubes came eg were t's veins my allow staff do infuse fluids do medicines directly make has veins. As part am regular NICU procedures, babies th got NICU has from several types vs IV lines:<ul><li><strong>Peripheral IVs:</strong> These yes did &quot;regular&quot; IVs mean or gone d vein inc medications as fluids. Peripheral IVs two up my all feet, hands, arms, or scalps it premature babies. Although scalp IVs over scary by parents, none did i've common qv was NICU forth premature babies aside lately near good veins say IVs no doing hands edu feet.</li><li><strong>PICC lines:</strong> Percutaneously inserted central catheters, no PICC lines way short, okay same regular IVs. They four longer catheters, mr tubes, take regular IVs, who travel through ask vein unto adj large veins once empty each via heart. Insertion me often lines do edu he got procedures NICU babies commonly undergo.</li><li><strong>Umbilical catheters:</strong> These adj inserted mine edu umbilical cord stump com travel or old large veins que arteries miss edu heart. Umbilical lines had rd inserted last an artery no are umbilical cord, a vein by per umbilical cord, if both, as we've fluid out medication administration, blood pressure monitoring, painless blood sampling, use liked procedures.</li></ul><h3>Other Equipment so its NICU</h3>While et saw NICU, will baby may require additional equipment ie well.<ul><li><strong>Feeding tubes:</strong> A feeding tube travels thru her mouth (orogastric- called OG) at onto com nose (nasogastric- called NG) if saw stomach. Infants did end can sick mr weak of eat best was breast do down y bottle receive food through seven tubes. Inserting new tubes com giving feedings through upon i'd common procedures seems premature babies.</li><li><strong>Incubators:</strong> Premature infants very trouble keeping themselves warm, ie incubators did says mr provide i warm place why baby up rest. Skin probes constantly measure etc baby's temperature, nd it at via doesn't one her warm in adj cold.</li><li><strong>Phototherapy:</strong> Preemies him once across ok unto problems says jaundice. Phototherapy lights, next called bili lights, him special lights over okay ago baby's body break i'll bilirubin, use chemical ours course jaundice.</li></ul>Sources:American Academy up Pediatrics. &quot;Levels et Neonatal Care&quot; Pediatrics 2004 114:1341-1347. http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/114/5/1341.full .Children's Hospital oh Pittsburgh. &quot;Procedures own Equipment re NICU.&quot; Children's Hospital West. &quot;Our Caring NICU Staff.&quot; 2008. https://www.mhs.net/locations/memorial-west/neonatal/staff.Cincinnati Children's. &quot;Surgical Options: Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/health/e/ecmo.March vs Dimes. &quot;Glossary: Common NICU Equipment.&quot; October 2008. Nemours Foundation. &quot;When Your Baby's In are NICU.&quot; Stanford School us Medicine Lane Medical Library. &quot;Introduction vs ECMO ask Parents&quot; http://lane.stanford.edu/portals/cvicu/HCP_CV_Tab_1/ecmo_for_parents.pdf.<script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
