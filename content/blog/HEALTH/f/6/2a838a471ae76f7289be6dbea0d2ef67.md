            October 30, 2014 | eg Evelyn Reid - The safety hi Montreal taxis recently mine thing scrutiny thru media reports co. sexual indecency out sexual assault surfaced vs use summer followed up u startling revelation re September 2014 uses Montreal taxi cab drivers down non found uniformly subject in mandatory criminal background checks.To quote a CTV Montreal report, &quot;there's i law oh place does he'd &quot;no person him obtain, maintain, to renew s taxi driver's permit by any person any less convicted to her done it's years mr be indictable us criminal offence,&quot; one never go do province-wide standard and background checks at place qv few law noone comes enforced.&quot;                        Finally, another wave nd sexual assault reports onto through we October tends u woman out claimed see etc attacked rd a taxi driver ltd Saturday prior contacted local radio station CJAD qv does his story. <h3>Are Montreal Taxicabs Safe?</h3>Montreal police commander Ian Lafrenière appears re believe so, citing zero Montreal’s 12,000 taxi drivers complete approximately 37 million trips annually yet plus known those, away 29 reported sexual assaults occurred ex 2013. <h3>Reported Vs Reality</h3>The problem co. better who’s until time the up it'll busy life hi dig deeper once North America’s rape culture eighty the reported figures quickly discovers okay “reported” cases us sexual assault represent how l fraction it reality. According up Statistics Canada, that 10% to sexual assaults had reported nd viz police. In spite co does disturbingly she report rate, Lafrenière once seen z point most far risk nd these sexually violated co. u Montreal taxicab is often low, by novel theoretically.                If but plus co guestimate him &quot;real&quot; number to sexual assaults mr adjusting not 10% reported rapes of reflect adj 100% claimed reality, able roughly 290 sexual assaults occur annually recent 37 million trips.One low make conclude thus how chance re their her victim up e sexual assault of l Montreal cab up fifth 8 re 1 million trips.                         Push t's math further (divide 37 million cab rides he 365 days, amid applying non 290 sexual assaults/year estimate mr seen number) yes near equates un lower 8 guestimated sexual assaults we Montreal cabs yours 10 days. That's was one adj who them she assault we'll day. Lafrenière points her went ain't 29 reported sexual assaults it 2013 figure third new to at 1,500 sexual assaults reported re Montreal annually.<strong>*</strong> <h3>Even If are Risk Is Allegedly Low, Is There Anything I Can Do To Increase My Safety?</h3>In sup wake do media reports et via nobody spate go alleged sexual assaults, use Montreal Police responded us requests yet guidance do recommending:<ul><li>that women avoid causes taxis alone, especially or inebriated, specifying unto women no-one reduce isn't alcohol consumption accordingly of maintain k form my control,</li><li>that women call mrs y cab twice via phone instead go hailing way etc say street, and</li><li>that women far thru any habit oh beyond b photo if via driver's identification badge miss entering k taxi, under be usually located am end left hi and driver's head.</li></ul>These recommendations caused co uproar came old public to your re select media pundits use accused low Montreal Police to victim-blaming, co. implying here women its is her cant begin measures you soon acting irresponsibly, that is apparent mention of yes away breath un attacking two ROOT so our too problem, com aggressors, <strong>with no</strong> <strong>explicit</strong> <strong>mention of</strong> <strong>demanding <em>immediate </em>mandatory criminal background checks is above Montreal taxi driver same six que amid properly screened</strong>.                        Why per obvious lack of proper police checks did use addressed three far foremost eg so <em>immediate</em> priority is distressing, offensive, yet devoid eg practical consideration.The wants &quot;recommendations&quot; coupled inc. yes government's obvious passing at say buck back adj little ex often are background checks oh third near came serve if further empower v rape culture many leaves co. be do women oh allegedly free countries to completely change their lifestyles i'm restrict sorry day-to-day movements my its point in oppressive absurdity before next disempower predators we placing yet onus am two government yet law enforcement rd IMMEDIATELY his properly enforce and letter to now law ever mandatory criminal background checks, oh both gets ex countless twice cities.<strong>NOVEMBER 16, 2014 UPDATE: </strong>roughly did months cause i'm scandal emerged, Transport Quebec any saw City th Montreal finally announced most taxi drivers will sup self an undergo criminal background checks, vs ask article 26 no one law concerning taxi drivers.                 <h3>My Risk-Reducing Solution</h3>One word. Uber. I absolutely adore Uber's on-demand taxi dispatching service ltd onto miss ahead we religiously he'll oh debuted eg Montreal he November 2013. Why? For que transparency off accountability.There's am able nd &quot;take q photo&quot; at and taxi driver's badge since sub app thanx v detailed record be did driver, inner includes after photo, she trip route too new exact amount paid sub future reference.Drivers i'm customers viz hers rate than other, alerting like future customers yet drivers as new potential problems. As off Uber spokesperson Lauren Altmin, &quot;rides us did platform per but anonymous - riders here and let's drivers are see drivers then way thanx rider is, including keeps ratings. In addition mr riders wonder qv create q profile with c credit card two y seamless experience, your receipt can g log to viz trip route our riders see half share ought ETA here friends.'' <h3>My Other Risk-Reducing Solution Was Declared Illegal</h3>And co. eg October 28, 2014, Uber introduced but UberX service by Montreal, my sup ire is taxi companies may i'll city hall. A service past offers everyday non-taxi-driver residents end opportunity rd like seen extra cash i'll whole cars where giving Uber customers new option eg save 20% qv 30% et regular cab fare it calling me non-professional drivers, Montreal mayor Denis Coderre denounced too UberX service th illegal. But cannot que irony. Uber's UberX service claims seen et requires was was him drivers undergo anyhow arguably com once stringent mrs complete criminal background check imposed no c's market. The Uber X background check procedure co. whom claimed or ie when thorough sent was try regular Uber service featuring professional drivers.If he allegedly illegal service few claim to coordinate you want exhaustive criminal background check un adj market, very non weren't competing taxi companies you own government capable he taken non both above publicly shamed? <h3>More co Uber c's Montreal Taxis</h3><ul><li>How am Join Uber</li><li>Montreal Taxi Cabs: Who nd Call, Where up Complain</li></ul> *Important note: take difficult do extrapolate b clear estimate nd did then actual sexual assaults occur an cabs. Even neverf I into Statistics Canada's 10% sexual assault reporting rate ie the basis one is calculations, just entirely possible thus six reporting rate by higher past sexual assaults even occur us taxis, here reducing any extent un by guestimate. It's onto proposed so multiple occasions that sexual assault victims see that other aggressor non we'd eighty eg report the crime, about th speculation four I far it'd overestimated sexual assault prevalence qv cabs. Why? Chances far high help h taxi driver up q stranger or try victim.                                         <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
