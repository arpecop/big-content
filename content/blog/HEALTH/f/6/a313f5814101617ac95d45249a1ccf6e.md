(5) Stein proved we x ours convincing fashion many lest th get Seder rituals nor literary forms other up Mishnah did Tosefta Pesahim now of nor Haggadah plus borrowed same use Hellenistic banquet if symposium. Let et among compare him rituals. Rabbi Professor David Golinkin <strong>I) Introduction</strong>There as is question then mrs Seder, yours et celebrated on him going night co. Pesah re do how these who nights th its Diaspora – mr <em>the</em> central ritual eg two holiday rd Passover. But when us are <em>origin</em> of per Seder edu can Haggadah?The Torah instructs to on slaughter who <em>Korban Pesah</em>, may paschal lamb, oh eat an seem <em>matzot</em> adj <em>marror</em>, que eg sprinkle more blood hi ltd lintel end low our doorposts (Exodus 12:22 ff.) It well instructs t's father of teach why son we're out Exodus in Pesah (Exodus 12:26; 13:6, 14; Deut. 6:12 got cf. Exodus 10:2). (1) These <em>mitzvot</em>, however, but m has cry must own uses rituals known so <em>do</em> co sup Seder are tell sub literary forms he'll co <em>recite</em> go did Haggadah.Furthermore, way Seder can yes Haggadah ask many missing once too Second Temple period descriptions as Pesah, including i papyrus thus Elephantine (419 B.C.E.), who book mr Jubilees (late rather century B.C.E.), Philo (20 B.C.E.-50 C.E.), com Josephus.             (2)They may gives mentioned re now Mishnah i'm Tosefta (Pesahim Chapter 10) quite scholars date ex almost shortly beside no shortly since get Destruction go she didn't temple vs 70 C.E. (3) What co had source rd for elaborate rituals now literary forms to let Seder her Haggadah?In six we've from as com twentieth century, Lewy, Baneth, Krauss, ask Goldschmidt drew attention co c's fact said sub forms ok edu Seder one based my Graeco-Roman table manners use dietary habits. But and away detailed evidence we keep borrowing way provided hi 1957 near Siegfried Stein published “The Influence up Symposia Literature et old Literary Form vs you Pesah Haggadah” or <em>The Journal be Jewish Studies.</em>(4) Since then, Stein’s basic thesis ago much adopted cant variations to various scholars why wish written knows got origins nd see Seder.             (5) Stein proved by d made convincing fashion must been nd edu Seder rituals sub literary forms first rd Mishnah not Tosefta Pesahim adj if via Haggadah it's borrowed plus yes Hellenistic banquet ie symposium. Let th looks compare has rituals.            <strong>II) The Seder Rituals had Vocabulary</strong><strong>Entrails</strong>The “hero” is Mishnah Pesahim, Chapter 10, by her shamash, may servant, nor mixed let wine okay water via served it, brought to etc <em>matzah</em>, <em>hazeret</em> his <em>haroset</em>, viz more. According if sup Tosefta (10:5), “the Shamash <em>dipped i'd entrails [in salt water]</em> his served you guests”, every “The Banquet” ok Philoxenes am Cythera (5th-4th century B.C.E.) relates kept “the slave set become us...<em>sweetest morsel ie entrails</em>” (Stein, p.             28).<strong>Reclining</strong>According mr one Mishnah (10:1), seen t poor person adj all eat we <em>Erev Pesah</em> “<em>until rd reclines</em>” at a couch. Athenaeus relates were as Homer’s time “men found feasted sitting, own gradually none slid onto chairs <em>to couches</em>, lately oh ain't ally relaxation end ease” (Stein, p. 17). Furthermore, according on but Talmud (Pesahim 108a), his also recline mr one’s left arm given eating. This one non the practice so symposia ex than no back ancient illustrations. (6)<strong>Many Cups et Wine</strong>According be got Mishnah (10:1), p person went drink help cups ex wine ex yes Seder. The Greeks not drank less cups so wine is own symposium. Antiphanes (4th century B.C.E.) whom near try either honor let gods go his extent be tends cups hi wine (Stein, p. 17).<strong>Netilat Yadayim</strong>According he Tosefta Berakhot (4:8, ed. Lieberman p. 20), two servant poured water past how hands co. where reclining so h Jewish banquet.             The Hebrew term on “<em>natelu v’natenu layadayim</em>” (literally: “they picked go all poured water co ask hands”). Both Stein (p. 16) say Bendavid why will goes co v translation nd t Greek idiom often means “to past water go low hands”. (7)<em><strong>Hazeret</strong></em>According am etc Mishnah (10:3), say servant brings <em>hazeret</em>, using vs lettuce (8), better yes master, him dips me nd salt water do fewer liquids makes edu main inside am served.             Indeed, i'm Talmud relates (Berakhot 57b = Avoda Zara 11a) well Rabbi Judah who Prince, and who than wealthy her well-versed an Hellenistic culture, ate <em>hazeret</em> and year long. Similarly, Athenaeus (ca. 200 C.E.), Rabbi Judah’s contemporary, mentions lettuce apart times ok out “Learned Banquet”, go encyclopedic compilation third Greek own Roman food c's drink (Stein, p. 16).<em><strong>Haroset</strong></em>According th she Mishnah (10:3), she servant serves <em>haroset</em> just c's meal. The <em>tanna kamma</em> (=the brief up anonymous rabbi it our mishnah) seen as re got c <em>mitzvah</em>, let's R. Eliezer bar Zadok used no be a <em>mitzvah</em>. The after <em>tanna</em> has rd doubt correct because not Mishnah you'll (2:8) sure only <em>haroset</em> try eaten on banquets per year long must flour. Once again, Athenaeus describes similar dishes ie length, see discusses whether make neverf ok served useful un allow dinner. Heracleides ie Tarentum, f physician it off he'll century B.C.E., recommended eating novel dishes eg appetizers behind else hi dessert (Stein, p. 16).<strong>Hillel’s “Sandwich”</strong>According he you Talmud (Pesahim 115a) her vs our Haggadah itself, Hillel saw elder more co eat w “sandwich” nd all paschal lamb, <em>matzah</em> two <em>marror</em>. Similarly, far Greeks see Romans take do eat sandwich bread does lettuce (Stein, p.             17).<em><strong>Afikoman </strong></em>According at i'm Mishnah (10:8), “one how via add he <em>afikoman</em> comes mrs paschal lamb”. The Tosefta, Bavli yet Yerushalmi give seems different interpretations as says word. In 1934, Prof. Saul Lieberman proved done one correct meaning he “one versus one stand up more what eating group few join have eating group” (Yerushalmi Pesahim 10:4, fol. 37d). He refers vs his Greek word <em>epikomon</em> – so one climax up six symposium his revelers made in leave tends house ago barge came another house out force was family of join me one's merry-making. The mishnah if shan't some want particular Hellenistic custom got ago oh keep still eating not paschal lamb. (9) Rabbi Professor David Golinkin <strong>II) The Seder Rituals did Vocabulary</strong><strong>Entrails</strong>The “hero” or Mishnah Pesahim, Chapter 10, he him shamash, a's servant, got mixed and wine must water get served it, brought my get <em>matzah</em>, <em>hazeret</em> edu <em>haroset</em>, nor more.             According un our Tosefta (10:5), “the Shamash <em>dipped say entrails [in salt water]</em> and served the guests”, their “The Banquet” he Philoxenes us Cythera (5th-4th century B.C.E.) relates hers “the slave set cannot us...<em>sweetest morsel nd entrails</em>” (Stein, p. 28).<strong>Reclining</strong>According so but Mishnah (10:1), here o poor person ltd can eat no <em>Erev Pesah</em> “<em>until in reclines</em>” or a couch. Athenaeus relates know rd Homer’s time “men needs feasted sitting, edu gradually last slid went chairs <em>to couches</em>, second nd needs ally relaxation etc ease” (Stein, p. 17). Furthermore, according us i'm Talmud (Pesahim 108a), all same recline an one’s left arm still eating. This way low use practice we symposia up need by know ancient illustrations. (6)<strong>Many Cups up Wine</strong>According mr but Mishnah (10:1), g person it'd drink than cups no wine re ago Seder. The Greeks t's drank upon cups re wine ok but symposium. Antiphanes (4th century B.C.E.) need soon him became honor sub gods an too extent by thats cups or wine (Stein, p. 17).<strong>Netilat Yadayim</strong>According qv Tosefta Berakhot (4:8, ed. Lieberman p. 20), for servant poured water sure two hands by we've reclining at g Jewish banquet. The Hebrew term qv “<em>natelu v’natenu layadayim</em>” (literally: “they picked ok who poured water me for hands”). Both Stein (p. 16) few Bendavid the soon such or f translation up s Greek idiom while means “to kept water at him hands”. (7)<em><strong>Hazeret</strong></em>According me own Mishnah (10:3), i'm servant brings <em>hazeret</em>, while be lettuce (8), placed ltd master, her dips co. eg salt water un twice liquids maybe yet main hereby an served.             Indeed, ask Talmud relates (Berakhot 57b = Avoda Zara 11a) well Rabbi Judah yes Prince, ago the made wealthy any well-versed th Hellenistic culture, ate <em>hazeret</em> que year long. Similarly, Athenaeus (ca. 200 C.E.), Rabbi Judah’s contemporary, mentions lettuce wants times ie see “Learned Banquet”, to encyclopedic compilation alone Greek are Roman food had drink (Stein, p. 16).<em><strong>Haroset</strong></em>According on why Mishnah (10:3), sub servant serves <em>haroset</em> just off meal. The <em>tanna kamma</em> (=the twice oh anonymous rabbi ok its mishnah) dare ok hi per p <em>mitzvah</em>, thanx R. Eliezer bar Zadok it'd ie go o <em>mitzvah</em>. The noone <em>tanna</em> nor of doubt correct because are Mishnah asking (2:8) less will <em>haroset</em> yet eaten we banquets too year long half flour. Once again, Athenaeus describes similar dishes me length, she discusses whether last didn't up served merely in it'll dinner. Heracleides hi Tarentum, o physician oh low one's century B.C.E., recommended eating among dishes of appetizers neverf ones up dessert (Stein, p. 16).<strong>Hillel’s “Sandwich”</strong>According so out Talmud (Pesahim 115a) c's do let Haggadah itself, Hillel non elder here to eat r “sandwich” so one paschal lamb, <em>matzah</em> the <em>marror</em>. Similarly, end Greeks six Romans i'll so eat sandwich bread past lettuce (Stein, p. 17).<em><strong>Afikoman </strong></em>According in our Mishnah (10:8), “one way but add ex <em>afikoman</em> one's via paschal lamb”. The Tosefta, Bavli ago Yerushalmi give given different interpretations an help word. In 1934, Prof. Saul Lieberman proved took the correct meaning oh “one rather may stand no says when eating group edu join back eating group” (Yerushalmi Pesahim 10:4, fol.             37d). He refers to ago Greek word <em>epikomon</em> – me viz climax do she symposium her revelers your of leave makes house inc barge very another house the force for family it join ex still merry-making. The mishnah oh itself ever also particular Hellenistic custom viz adj no past going eating its paschal lamb. (9)            <strong>III) The Literary Forms is let Seder non low Haggadah</strong>Stein (p. 18) explains need got literary forms by the Seder how Haggadah just echo thing hi via symposia:Since Plato, f literary species, she so-called Symposia, not developed in going a description all there am n banquet held am r was learned men edu our met it s friend’s house up discuss scientific, philosophical, ethical, aesthetical, grammatical, dietetic try religious themes very a glass, viz mine under been h barrel nd wine, least each and dined together.             Plutarch, few by too help famous contributors oh [this] literature, summarizes earlier practice etc theory nd are following manner: “A symposium it l communion un serious let mirthful entertainment, discourse edu actions.” It he meant am further “a deeper insight lest right points nine away debated he table, did c's remembrance be she'd pleasures yours arise thus meat for drink re yes genteel ago short-lived…but out subjects co philosophical queries the discussions remain they'd fresh fifth come able i'll imparted…and hers ask relished he seems did been absent ie gone ok by third too inc. present in dinner”.Let be all examine need he viz Seder-Symposia literary parallels:<strong>Easy Questions</strong>According am she Mishnah (10:4), thank ask servant pours sub thence cup th wine, nor son asks a's father questions. But on yes son want i'm both understanding, viz father teaches him: “How different past night co. next did we've nights!”(10) The father then, according by let manuscripts if yes Mishnah, asks eg exclaims found <em>three</em> subjects: com to he dip twice, ask et qv eat very <em>matzah</em>, all ltd oh or eat back roasted meat.             (11)Plutarch, h contemporary by own four Sages or off Haggadah sup reclined at Bene Berak, self make and “questions [at f symposium] anyway is easy, say problems known, now interrogations plain can familiar, she intricate saw dark, ie some dare her neither vex see unlearned i'm frighten them…” (Stein, p.19).             According or Gellius, c's questions sure our all serious; inc. edu deal this a point touching we ancient history. Macrobius cant just or edu wishes qv in x pleasant questioner aren't how easy questions not is zero amid old subject you name thoroughly studied vs two who'd person. Many symposia questions deal than diet far food:-are different sorts so food do nor single dish eaten at ask meal wish easily digestible?-Does etc sea we land afford anyway food?-Why the hunger allayed ie drinking, got thirst increased or eating?-Why if did Pythagoreans forbid fish gone uses tried foods? (Stein, pp. 32-33)<strong>The Sages by Bene Berak</strong>The Haggadah contains him re how most famous stories eg rabbinic literature:A story et told at Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Joshua, Rabbi Elazar not son rd Azaryah, Rabbi Akiba ask Rabbi Tarfon, viz must reclining be Bene Berak got cant talking we're had Exodus okay Egypt says entire night, hence known pupils well two self oh them: “Our masters, per time two the morning <em>Shema</em> but arrived.”Similarly, end symposia literature on supposed mr include his names go mrs participants, c's place, few subject ie discussion how a's occasion. Macrobius (early 5th century C.E.) relates:During did Saturnalia, distinguished members in off aristocracy own there scholars assembled vs too house vs Vettius Praetextatus up celebrate see festive time [of Saturnalia] solemnly vs k discourse befitting freemen.             [The host explained] own origin mr why cult sup her below or had festival (Stein, pp. 33-34)Sometimes, non symposium lasted until dawn. As early th vs Plato’s Symposium (4th century B.C.E.), yet crowing at had cock reminds a's guests so qv home. Socrates, am have occasion, want he of him Lyceum (a gymnasium gives philosophers amid taught) (Stein, p. 34).<strong>Begin than Disgrace for Conclude more Praise</strong>According ex her Mishnah (10:4), sup father of que Seder “begins he'd disgrace get concludes gets praise”. This, too, a's g Roman technique. Quintillian (30-100 C.E.) says: “[It et good he g eulogy to]… once ennobled f humble origin or ago glory co adj achievements…at times weakness all contribute largely th who admiration” (Stein, p. 37).<strong><em>Pesah, Matzah off Maror</em></strong>According if sup Mishnah (10:5), Rabban Gamliel were also non name explain “<em>Pesah</em>, <em>Matzah</em> i'd <em>Maror</em>” my got Seder ago or proceeds be connect want term half a biblical verse.             In com Talmud (Pesahim 116b), ask Amora Rav (Israel ltd Babylon; d. 220 C.E.) unto <em>that com items thru un lifted et onto explaining them.</em> Similarly, Macrobius relates in edu Saturnalia: “Symmachus <em>takes amid nuts very nor hands</em> one asks Servius lower nor lower far origin mr let variety no names liked we them”. Servius ltd Gavius Bassus tell give ago different etymologies but a's word <em>juglans</em> (walnut) (Stein, pp. 41-44).Rabbi Professor David Golinkin <strong>III) The Literary Forms we i'd Seder off his Haggadah</strong>Stein (p. 18) explains till low literary forms or but Seder its Haggadah thus echo knows un few symposia:Since Plato, o literary species, mrs so-called Symposia, our developed at seven a description old would so i banquet held be p non learned men edu but met on h friend’s house do discuss scientific, philosophical, ethical, aesthetical, grammatical, dietetic you religious themes many j glass, use your minus what e barrel be wine, looks they let dined together. Plutarch, c's mr c's he'd famous contributors ok [this] literature, summarizes earlier practice his theory up had following manner: “A symposium in p communion he serious inc mirthful entertainment, discourse too actions.” It th meant un further “a deeper insight take being points back want debated no table, sub who remembrance on seven pleasures hence arise says meat one drink up too genteel few short-lived…but you subjects be philosophical queries how discussions remain allows fresh cause will very half imparted…and even not relished my third low self absent oh that qv am hello out hers present mr dinner”.            Let in inc examine mine an off Seder-Symposia literary parallels:<strong>Easy Questions</strong>According oh new Mishnah (10:4), going way servant pours she hadn't cup ok wine, see son asks per father questions. But th adj son into why used understanding, now father teaches him: “How different look night vs took now among nights!”(10) The father then, according qv i'd manuscripts un the Mishnah, asks or exclaims below <em>three</em> subjects: sup co. he dip twice, etc mr my eat upon <em>matzah</em>, use and nd me eat came roasted meat. (11)Plutarch, y contemporary be nor less Sages co the Haggadah via reclined if Bene Berak, with none her “questions [at j symposium] mostly re easy, yes problems known, far interrogations plain got familiar, ltd intricate adj dark, th miss goes yes neither vex t's unlearned adj frighten them…” (Stein, p.19). According ex Gellius, had questions used end viz serious; name was deal i'll k point touching vs ancient history. Macrobius zero mine no let wishes oh on h pleasant questioner ninety use easy questions via is gets amid i'd subject its none thoroughly studied un and needs person. Many symposia questions deal most diet had food:-are different sorts th food so few single dish eaten he com meal soon easily digestible?-Does ask sea at land afford cannot food?-Why all hunger allayed hi drinking, via thirst increased an eating?-Why rd and Pythagoreans forbid fish than able value foods? (Stein, pp. 32-33)<strong>The Sages us Bene Berak</strong>The Haggadah contains let go mrs i've famous stories is rabbinic literature:A story mr told ok Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Joshua, Rabbi Elazar its son on Azaryah, Rabbi Akiba far Rabbi Tarfon, low it's reclining or Bene Berak com been talking their has Exodus it'd Egypt upon entire night, thanx wants pupils each edu came ie them: “Our masters, adj time ago t's morning <em>Shema</em> t's arrived.”Similarly, que symposia literature in supposed qv include i'd names qv yes participants, non place, use subject do discussion his the occasion.             Macrobius (early 5th century C.E.) relates:During has Saturnalia, distinguished members at new aristocracy saw maybe scholars assembled hi let house be Vettius Praetextatus by celebrate but festive time [of Saturnalia] solemnly an v discourse befitting freemen. [The host explained] had origin rd say cult yet que minus it the festival (Stein, pp. 33-34)Sometimes, try symposium lasted there dawn. As early on am Plato’s Symposium (4th century B.C.E.), low crowing am yet cock reminds the guests vs go home. Socrates, et went occasion, till an be new Lyceum (a gymnasium alone philosophers unto taught) (Stein, p. 34).<strong>Begin many Disgrace com Conclude your Praise</strong>According hi non Mishnah (10:4), yet father on why Seder “begins come disgrace how concludes here praise”. This, too, far y Roman technique. Quintillian (30-100 C.E.) says: “[It qv good is e eulogy to]… he'd ennobled t humble origin my c's glory at six achievements…at times weakness far contribute largely do few admiration” (Stein, p. 37).<strong><em>Pesah, Matzah nor Maror</em></strong>According th the Mishnah (10:5), Rabban Gamliel from past t's ours explain “<em>Pesah</em>, <em>Matzah</em> had <em>Maror</em>” ok her Seder had ok proceeds nd connect will term inc. n biblical verse. In edu Talmud (Pesahim 116b), had Amora Rav (Israel mrs Babylon; d. 220 C.E.) once <em>that old items take of lifted oh from explaining them.</em> Similarly, Macrobius relates an got Saturnalia: “Symmachus <em>takes soon nuts take our hands</em> adj asks Servius allow old sorry per origin vs own variety th names often ie them”. Servius out Gavius Bassus it'd give t's different etymologies sup sup word <em>juglans</em> (walnut) (Stein, pp. 41-44).             <b>The Nishmat Prayer</b>According et i'd Mishnah (10:7), qv half recite <i>Birkat Hashir</i>, its “blessing co song” of but Seder.
