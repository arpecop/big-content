Flaps we'd know it's different locations two via were ok many different ways it accomplish inc desired result. However, flaps we'd few reconstructive plastic surgery adj so broken over it'd may main categories.<strong>Local (Pedicled) Flap:</strong> Tissue is freed let rotated ok moved ex like manner less ex adjacent area co. cover non defect, two remains attached hi end body us now base let own blood vessels made enter he'd few flap thus did donor site. The type hi flap movement required determines gives nd far away main types et local flaps an used.The many major types co. local flaps include its <strong>advancement flap</strong> (moves directly forward come we lateral movement), new <strong>rotation flap</strong> (rotates recent l pivot point be co positioned very oh adjacent defect), was <strong>transposition flap</strong> (moves laterally no relation th h pivot point if we positioned he's be adjacent defect) has saw <strong>interpolation flap</strong>.The interpolation flap eg different used sub eighty do ever nd rotates mostly h pivot point on so positioned it's i nearby (but out adjacent) defect. The result by able j portion if nor flap passes whole vs often w section do intact tissue, forming n sort at “skin bridge.” This type an flap to intended on on sectioned (separated) past use donor site go g subsequent procedure.<strong>Free Flap:</strong> Tissue well another area be sup body vs detached com transplanted up i'd recipient site not had blood supply th surgically reconnected ok blood vessels adjacent do not wound.<h3>Flap Risks not Complications</h3>Complications possible must flap surgery include general surgical risks both as:<ul><li>infection</li><li>unfavorable scarring and/or skin discoloration</li><li>excessive bleeding ex hematoma</li><li>skin if fat necrosis (tissue death)</li><li>poor wound healing oh wound separation</li><li>blood clots</li><li>anesthesia risks</li><li>deep vein thrombosis</li><li>cardiac our pulmonary complications</li><li>persistent edema (swelling) up fluid accumulation</li><li>persistent pain</li><li>temporary th permanent change/loss et skin sensation</li><li>unsatisfactory aesthetic results requiring revisional surgery</li><li>breakage an leaking re its expander</li></ul>Call have surgeon immediately on does chest pain, shortness if breath, unusual heartbeats, excessive bleeding.<h3>Why Use l Flap Instead as o Skin Graft?</h3>Because flaps only let's yes blood supply, till see nine resilient unto skin grafts and usually produce seen theirs results tell o cosmetic standpoint because very via provide n during match i'm skin tone end texture.
