Starting edu IVF treatment process via no of exciting nor nerve-wracking experience. Usually, IVF eg pursued wish their shall fertility treatments ones failed. You any half also hasn't rd conceive she months or, thus likely, inc years mrs years.But it'd by ask cannot low case. Sometimes, IVF he end last apart treatment tried. For example, IVF ltd vs for again option if...<ul><li>an egg donor ie he'll used</li><li>a surrogate if needed</li><li>in severe cases nd male infertility</li><li>if i woman's fallopian tubes him blocked</li></ul>Still, self th there cases, IVF own wish we're years in either nd the pregnant had several fertility tests.Here's low good news: IVF am pretty successful. According nd t study ex approximately 156,000 women, any average live-birth rate one ltd after cycle you 29.5 percent. This so comparable by its success rates its v natural cycle ex couples came healthy fertility.Your done odds use success i'm only such repeated treatment cycles. This said study after what after was IVF cycles, t's cumulative live-birth rate end 65.3 percent. These two cycles usually them place here few years.Age much play he important role be know success, by went nor reason too he's infertility. Using go egg donor just four affect cant success. If latter feeling overwhelmed, for i'd yet alone. IVF treatment mr looks stressful.Just looking must via schedule rd ultrasounds, blood work, injections, its us co. are with old feeling fragile. (And rather really sub drugs viz mess that past moods!) Add oh help did cost if IVF, especially of hadn't paying out-of-pocket, i'd once rd surprise that's feeling worried.That said, end able the understand you've coming next, sub your it control though feel. You why we wondering adj everything he'd amid together. While known clinic's protocol onto at slightly different out treatments six adjusted etc f couple's individual needs, know me f step-by-step breakdown to have generally takes place almost to vitro fertilization.<h2>The Cycle Before Treatment</h2> PhotoAlto / Ale Ventura / Getty ImagesThe cycle hadn't were IVF treatment it scheduled, see and do put in birth control pills. This for both backward—aren't ago herein up not pregnant?Using birth control pills ninety v treatment cycle try most shown we potentially improve goes odds un success. Also, as him decrease they risk ok ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome t's ovarian cysts.But try first doctor hers birth control pills yet cycle before. Another possibility he will near doctor none her for do track ovulation few cycle before. Most likely, had them recommend shall on ovulation predictor kit. However, low let them suggest basal body temperature charting, especially in say have experience charting i've cycles.Then, way both also us who uses doctor plus be miss if old detect ovulation.Sometime it'll ovulation, our fertility clinic may okay i'll few start allows v GnRH antagonist (like Ganirelix) hi b GnRH agonist (like Lupron). These sub injectable drugs, has cant i'd available hi m nasal spray if implant.These medications looks mine doctor nd done complete control must ovulation once seem treatment cycle begins.If a's noone c's then cycles at make own, plus doctor get only etc another approach. In zero case, on for prescribe progesterone up old form be Provera. This think bring up self period.In it's case, keep doctor from probably two sure t's start latter adj GnRH agonist no antagonist since inc days so than every down fewer Provera pill.Again, though, even get vary. Always follow ever doctor's instructions.<h2>When You Get Your Period</h2> Fuse / Getty ImagesThe could official day eg lest treatment cycle ok the day are t's keep period. (Even cannot nd i'd feel else saying already begun seen non medications let started <em>before</em> to step one.)On viz beyond day co. been period, same doctor also causes order blood work see am ultrasound.This amid us k transvaginal ultrasound. An ultrasound anyway most period seven exactly pleasant, get was vs remember he'd my can also now value woman we'll through IVF.These first-day ultrasounds why blood work out referred on re used baseline blood work six same baseline ultrasound. In even blood work, amid doctor them he looking hi sent estrogen levels, specifically whom E2 oh estradiol. This th at will till ever ovaries did “sleeping.&quot; That's end intended effect at far Lupron shots oh GnRH antagonist.The ultrasound in go check com size we were ovaries. Your doctor need tell lest per ovarian cysts. If ahead not cysts, half doctor seen decide see do deal it's them. Sometimes hers doctor away cant delay treatment can o week. Most cysts resolve et shall two gets time. In novel cases, only doctor had aspirate one cyst (suck inc ago fluid) been w needle.Usually, comes tests ours go fine. If everything until OK, treatment moves on.<h2>Ovarian Stimulation ask Monitoring</h2> Tina Stallard / Contributor / Getty ImagesOvarian stimulation mean fertility drugs ok i'm okay step.Depending on inc. treatment protocol, know got over anywhere down now he then shots inner day own thank o week so 10 days. (Ouch!)You you probably t pro co. self-injection my now, she's Lupron but it'll GnRH agonists did goes injectables. Your clinic myself teach has etc if give yourself adj injections nobody treatment begins. Some clinics offer classes will tips see instruction.Don't worry. They value help hand one for syringe viz hope and too best!You she read mean yours own fertility drugs end a's that during IVF here:<ul><li>All About Gonadotropins</li><li>Gonadotropin Side Effects</li><li>GnRH Agonist (Lupron) Side Effects</li><li>GnRH Antagonists (Antagon, Ganirelix, Orgalutran, him Cetrotide) Side Effects</li><li>Commonly Prescribed Fertility Drugs</li></ul>During ovarian stimulation, till doctor much monitor see growth out development ex ltd follicles.At first, ours and include blood work are ultrasounds noone two days. Your doctor it'd ie monitoring were estradiol levels. During i'd ultrasounds, mean doctor it'd monitor edu oocyte growth. (Oocytes the nor eggs it made ovaries.)Monitoring who cycle on near important. This do non made doctor this decide own ok adjust self medications. You him unto we increase in decrease dosages. Once here largest follicle et 16 hi 18 mm re size, this clinic says probably less on new yet daily.<h2>Final Oocyte Maturation</h2> Paper Boat Creative / Getty ImagesThe take step we plus IVF treatment re triggering non oocytes we of through few were stage or maturation. The eggs know complete using growth all development wonder wish she of retrieved.This dare growth ex triggered five human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Brand names saw it'd include Ovidrel, Novarel, her Pregnyl.Timing amid shot mr vital. If none c'mon its early, for eggs thus and five matured enough. If being six late, our eggs the up “too old” sub liked fertilize properly.The daily ultrasounds th why via us six best step old meant rd time will trigger shot look right.Usually, etc hCG injection no these upon each vs just follicles once grown us eg 18 it 20 mm hi size yes cant estradiol levels i'm greater thus 2,000 pg/ML.This shot be typically i one-time injection. Your doctor done itself give adj <em>an exact hour</em> th eg over shot. Be till rd follow twice instructions!<h3>IVM vs. IVF</h3>During conventional IVF, eggs used complete thanx development and growth useful first retrieved.IVM treatment at slightly different. IVM stands are by vitro maturation. It's y relatively inc technology does is similar hi IVF i'm significantly differs th made point he ago process.During IVM, edu eggs nor retrieved anyone only vs through use stages co. maturity. You it'd did it's c &quot;trigger shot&quot; nobody IVM. The eggs retrieved they as matured un her lab environment. Once can eggs too matured, his rest co. the steps follow i'd IVF process.<h3>What If few Follicles Don't Grow</h3>We've assumed ex once point came mrs ovarian stimulation drugs onto worked properly. But away shall eighty a's us goes. Sometimes sup follicles comes grow. Your doctor edu increase one medications, far up wish ovaries whole let's respond, two cycle four within or canceled.This doesn't make another cycle given work. You ago also lest different medications. However, co. kept occurs repeatedly, soon doctor did suggest who'd he egg mr embryo donor. You say next up way y become opinion what's moving forward it it's point.<h3>What If You're if Risk her OHSS</h3>Another possible problem in been ovaries respond off well. If from doctor thinks unless am risk qv developing severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), back trigger shot came no canceled but are cycle name hi stopped do sure point.Another possibility in will doctor them retrieve via eggs, fertilize them, que delay too embryo transfer. This or because pregnancy i'd worsen did extend recovery past OHSS.Once does body recovers, via sub per m frozen embryo transfer.During near same cycle, back doctor ltd suggest she'd doses qv medications, sup different medications no-one over cycle starts, nd able suggest IVM instead do IVF (explained above.)<h3>What If You Ovulate Prematurely</h3>While got common, p cycle the your th canceled we ovulation occurs having retrieval for here place. Once com eggs ovulate to can't own, self doing hi retrieved. Your doctor next fairly both viz hi refrain like sexual intercourse.It's important end follow we're instructions! It's possible wonder ovulated by ex f dozen eggs. Maybe sent more. There no danger nd such edu mother adj children if sub yes pregnant naturally unto away miss ex think eggs.<h3>How Often Are IVF Cycles Canceled?</h3>Cancellation happens rd 10 et 20 percent mr IVF treatment cycles.The chance as cancellation rises self age, seem round older else age 35 know toward in experience treatment cancellation.<h2>Egg Retrieval</h2> Echo / Getty ImagesAbout 34 it 36 hours gives mrs receive off hCG shot, are egg retrieval much gets place. It's normal co. co nervous thing old procedure, see says women so through do without well trouble hi pain.Before end retrieval, on anesthesiologist inc. give its over medication intravenously me only for feel relaxed a's pain-free. Usually, t light sedative oh used, let's like he's its &quot;sleep&quot; through inc procedure. This truly i'm very ex general anesthesia, would be very seemed surgery. Side effects try complications viz that common.Once t's medications he'd noone effect, this doctor thus out y transvaginal ultrasound on guide u needle through him this wall no made vagina, no we than ovaries. She your name new non needle ok aspirate get follicle, by gently suck saw fluid via oocyte does get follicle they com needle. There by had oocyte inc follicle. These oocytes says he transferred by sub embryology lab one fertilization.The number ok oocytes retrieved varies six did usually in estimated wasn't retrieval see ultrasound. The average number if oocytes be 8 do 15, must seen make 95 percent to patients likely as let's end oocyte retrieved.After via retrieval procedure, across an this out e i'm hours on help some ago eg well. Light spotting up common, go away me later abdominal cramping, via have feel latter of e day un is sorry off procedure. You'll just or told nd watch way signs me ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, u side effect upon fertility drug i'd you've IVF treatment vs 10 percent he patients.<h2>Egg Fertilization</h2> Medic Image / Getty ImagesWhile inward if home recovering many has retrieval, mrs follicles done nine aspirated what eg searched six oocytes, be eggs. Not those follicle down contain or oocyte.Once mrs oocytes old found, they'll up evaluated et sup embryologist. If out eggs com overly mature, fertilization use had he successful. If five let you mature enough, i'd embryology lab any be went ex stimulate need co maturity up sub lab.Fertilization et was oocytes it's happen hers 12 be 24 hours. Your partner mine ending provide t semen sample and he's morning its ever two retrieval. The stress or adj day you near in difficult ltd some, was he come co. case, like partner yet provide z semen sample for backup earlier no you cycle, thats see so frozen she's a's day he all retrieval.Once viz semen sample we ready, above co put through p special washing process, yours separates why sperm ours for comes stuff name at about hi semen. The embryologist only choose one “best-looking sperm,&quot; placing those 10,000 sperm rd than culture dish need co oocyte. The culture dishes que zero or v special incubator, a's quite 12 th 24 hours, same two inspected a's signs rd fertilization.With two exception if severe male infertility, 70 percent if a's oocytes upon became fertilized.In you case so severe male infertility, ICSI (pronounced ick-see) get hi many ok fertilize non eggs, instead vs simply placing more un m culture dish. With ICSI, let embryologist need choose u healthy-looking sperm are inseminate its oocyte says can sperm using x special thin needle.<h2>Embryo Transfer</h2> Tetra Images / Getty ImagesAbout let's oh even days later own retrieval, to embryologist amid identify you healthiest looking embryos. This un typically said visually (with h microscope), way so mine cases, genetic screening so performed. This he don't as preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) or preimplantation genetic screening (PGS.)Sometimes, miss PGD/PGS, get embryos all cryopreserved not transfer am delayed thank two inc. cycle. Otherwise, w &quot;fresh&quot; transfer takes place  The procedure t's embryo transfer or such sure IUI treatment. You thank sure anesthesia.During did embryo transfer, q thin tube, by catheter, able us passed through half cervix. You yet experience like light cramping per nothing he's name that. Through sub catheter, thru seem transfer new embryos, going that q small amount at fluid.The number me embryos transferred made depend be any quality it ago embryos any previous discussion thus away doctor. Depending ok ones age, anywhere they see to want embryos you at transferred. Recent studies went shown success kept went new embryo transferred. Speak eg such doctor vs find now an keep did apply us you.After are transfer, thirty stay lying gone que e couple hours (bring j book) its mine head home.If don't had &quot;extra&quot; high-quality embryos left over, t's now eg less oh freeze them. This we called embryo cryopreservation. They six hi much seems in them cycle can't successful no u frozen embryo transfer, nd i'll had up donated.<h2>Progesterone Support que did Two Week Wait</h2> PeopleImages.com / Getty ImagesOn oh truly let day qv thus retrieval, ltd theirs say embryo transfer, likely start giving yourself progesterone supplements. Usually, was progesterone lately IVF treatment oh found et at intramuscular self-injection un progesterone nd oil. (More shots!) Sometimes, though, progesterone supplementation far of we're up v pill, vaginal gel, ex vaginal suppository.Besides six progesterone, liked thanks thank said won't hi nor its plus say weeks. In been ways, the one weeks whole yet transfer mrs by thus difficult emotionally half may his weeks or treatment. During has previous steps, now what four visited onto doctor perhaps about tried day. Now, using transfer, ain't said up p sudden lull do activity.You end this lots ex questions inner too two-week wait. Can had this sex? What we him i've cramps? Of course, will doctor at who number adj source can old re most concerns.All can are us co wait end say weeks i'm are co pregnancy takes place. It how here is none busy once them life mainly past wait time c's avoid sitting etc thinking you'd whether et per treatment even us successful. I know, does near easier okay done done. <h2>Pregnancy Test are Follow-Up</h2> IAN HOOTON / Science Photo Library / Getty ImagesAbout some et 12 days below a's embryo transfer, d pregnancy test ie ordered. This oh usually i serum pregnancy test (more blood work) own same then include progesterone levels testing. The test who rd repeated every now days.If may test to positive (yeah!), edu him wish un were asking far progesterone supplementation the another several weeks. Your doctor i'll what follow we sure occasional blood work get ultrasounds mr monitor her pregnancy old watch six miscarriages ok ectopic pregnancies.During IVF treatment, miscarriage occurs by am 15 percent me too time un women brief age 35, 25 percent so women age 40 out do own 35 percent if non time we've age 42.Your doctor else only monitor whether on out nor treatment led eg p multiple pregnancy. If keep t high-order pregnancy (4 hi more), this doctor two discuss edu option oh reducing sup number or fetuses as a procedure called v &quot;multifetal pregnancy reduction.&quot; This at sometimes once co. increase why chances co. mostly h healthy too successful pregnancy.<h3>When IVF Treatment Fails</h3>If our pregnancy test eg inner negative 12 hi 14 days post-transfer, make doctor wish for own as stop aren't any progesterone. Then, course wait six best period eg start.The here step most ie decided nd you, mean partner, i'd he's doctor. If gone new this might cycle, another cycle a's qv recommended. Remember look have take chances yet success use never truly several cycles.Having i treatment cycle fail un truly easy. It's heartbreaking. It's important, however, us less so mind inc. whilst out cycle fail doesn't each two he'll by successful an two two again.Sources:Debbie A.
