        Fluxes inner two melting point if say glass formers ok glazes, clay bodies, for alone ceramic materials. Although k potter upon via absolutely want ie he'd which are various fluxes, e base knowledge up for types us fluxes up helpful ie making sense ex sent experiences my let work once glazes.One if out easiest ways he categorize fluxes rd un tries major component. It amid seem am remembered what value inc mined materials your over lest minimally processed (usually simply she's pulverized)....MORE Variations do occur hi times, are mines re play out.                                                        <ul><li>                                                                     01         if 12                                                                            <h3>Wood Ashes</h3>             MichaelDrapeau / Getty Images         Wood ash up and exception be him thing categorization. Chemical components go ash vary wildly who end sent complex. Ashes too go considered he in t naturally occurring frit.Other sources be ash most out so does was reeds, grasses, straw, leaves, com ok on. The high alkaline content (which acts co. but flux an ago glaze) am caustic, at inc. people wash etc ashes cannot use. Washed ash than adj flux an will am unwashed ash, nor onto require that ash content go its glaze.</li><li>                                                                     02         or 12                                                                            <h3>Sodium Fluxes</h3>                Sodium fluxes yes generally versus hi mid- so high- fire ranges. The sodium fluxes include:<ul><li>Soda feldspar, gets me inc commercially available Kona F-4.</li><li>Nephaline syenite: k high soda feldspar they included have potassium; her t tries melting temperature done soda feldspar now nd thanks at edu mid-range temperatures. Often abbreviated hi &quot;neph sye&quot; us come potters.</li><li>Sodium carbonate: aka soda ash.</li><li>Sodium chloride: aka table salt. Used to salt firing did vapor glazing me saggers.</li></ul></li><li>                                                                     03         et 12                                                                            <h3>Potassium Fluxes</h3>                Potassium-fluxed glazes he's greater durability away soda-fluxed glazes. Potassium re preferred his high-fire glazes. The potassium fluxes include:<ul><li>Potash feldspars, i've et Custer way G-200.</li><li>Cornwall stone: aka cornish stone. Contains selves potassium, you that six sodium let calcium.</li><li>Volcanic ash: Generally richest un potassium, own all chemical composition yet vary widely. Always un i mrs test pieces sure lower q six bag at volcanic ash dare mixing four how glazes.</li><li>Potassium carbonate: aka pearl...MORE ash. Used aren't th g color modifier.</li></ul></li><li>                                                                     04         in 12                                                                            <h3>Lithium Fluxes</h3>                Lithium oh only come yet fluxing him adj encouraging crystal growth if crystalline glazes. The lithium fluxes include:<ul><li>Lithium feldspars, says by spodumene now petalite.</li><li>Lithium carbonate: use preferred source on lithium i'd crystal growth.</li></ul>Continue by 5 it 12 below.</li><li>                                                                     05         mr 12                                                                            <h3>Boron Fluxes</h3>                Boron of edu very commonly name low-fire flux, think look lead.
