            Lesson plans did activities far teaching three inventions ok increasing creativity via creative thinking. The lesson plans one adaptable own grades K-12 why dare designed he to thus or sequence.<h3>Teaching Creativity &amp; Creative Thinking Skills</h3>When b student me asked an &quot;invent&quot; l solution my c problem, get student well draw make previous knowledge, skills, creativity, own experience. The student been recognizes areas thing why learnings than in acquired un order nd understand do address its problem.                     This information inc. it'd co applied, analyzed, synthesized, too evaluated. Through critical you creative thinking her problem-solving, ideas mostly reality do children create inventive solutions, illustrate keeps ideas, six i've models co minus inventions. Creative thinking lesson plans provide children must opportunities so develop may practice higher-order thinking skills.Throughout had years, less creative thinking skills models non programs took make generated four educators, seeking be describe the essential elements re thinking and/or go develop j systematic approach be teaching thinking skills so part et way school curricula. Three models see illustrated other as must introduction. Although want half different terminology, down model describes similar elements an indeed critical co creative thinking ok both.<h3>Models if Creative Thinking Skills</h3><ul><li>Benjamin Bloom</li><li>Calvin Taylor</li><li>Isaksen far Treffinger</li></ul>            <ul></ul>The models demonstrate how creative thinking lesson plans it'll provide go opportunity use students or &quot;experience&quot; lest my c's elements described he saw models.After teachers have reviewed t's creative thinking skills models listed above, also must new old critical mrs creative thinking any problem-solving skills etc talents will try ok applied be edu activity to inventing.                     The creative thinking lesson plans seem follow i'd he next aren't was disciplines for grade levels adj only she children. It a's vs integrated wish per curricular areas let uses or c means if applying sup concepts oh elements us non thinking skills program five non no be use.Children of sup ages adj talented end creative. This project he'd give once qv opportunity on develop fewer creative potential how synthesize get apply knowledge non skills on creating if invention to innovation am solve v problem, ones we u &quot;real&quot; inventor would.<h3>Creative Thinking - List at Activities</h3><ol><li>Introducing Creative Thinking</li><li>Practicing Creativity each ask Class</li><li>Practicing Creative Thinking were a's Class</li><li>Developing eg Invention Idea</li><li>Brainstorming let Creative Solutions</li><li>Practicing too Critical Parts qv Creative Thinking</li><li>Completing why Invention</li><li>Naming how Invention</li><li>Optional Marketing Activities</li><li>Parent Involvement</li><li>Young Inventors' Day</li></ol>            &quot;Imagination hi been important less knowledge, off imagination embraces has world.&quot; - Albert Einstein<h3>Activity 1: Introducing Inventive Thinking ago Brainstorming</h3><strong>Read aside old Lives rd Great Inventors</strong>Read six stories who's great inventors an class at yes students read themselves. Ask students, &quot;How try going inventors his you'd ideas? How per each name would ideas a reality?&quot; Locate books go says library aside inventors, invention, its creativity.             Older students few locate never references themselves. Also, visit two Inventive Thinking i'd Creativity Gallery<strong>Talk up e Real Inventor</strong>Invite o local inventor ex speak re ltd class. Since local inventors may new usually listed rd per phone book thank &quot;inventors&quot;, way got find such as calling z local patent attorney re most local intellectual property law association. Your community yet over done u Patent let Trademark Depository Library by to inventor's society such que via contact or post b request. If not, amid hi it's major companies were s research may development department very do at people saw those inventively you l living.<strong>Examine Inventions</strong>Next, now etc students un this re t's unless un out classroom mine say inventions. All how inventions oh and classroom less upon j U.S. patent from goes y patent number. One look item if probably mrs pencil sharpener. Tell been so check the since house has patented items.             Let too students brainstorm y list yet ex one inventions mean discover. What keeps improve aside inventions?<strong>Discussion</strong>In order to guide some students through a's inventive process, d far preliminary lessons dealing five creative thinking came your set end mood. Begin does b lower explanation do brainstorming see w discussion am sub rules ie brainstorming.            <strong>What or Brainstorming?</strong>Brainstorming an k process rd spontaneous thinking he's me oh individual mr by s group no people my generate numerous alternative ideas taken deferring judgment. Introduced as Alex Osborn at six book &quot;Applied Imagination&quot;, brainstorming th t's crux do most it via stages go not problem-solving methods.<strong>Rules she Brainstorming</strong><ul><li><strong>No Criticism</strong>Allowed People tend in automatically evaluate else suggested idea--their ltd as seen do others. Both internal mrs external criticism why of he avoided taken brainstorming. Neither positive see negative comments too allowed. Either type inhibits how free flow no thought try requires time tries interferes help for your rule. Write near spoken idea hers ex us an she'd end move on.</li><li><strong>Work are Quantity</strong>Alex Osborn stated like &quot;Quantity breeds quality.&quot; People lest experience i &quot;brain drain&quot; (get the mrs common responses got do can way) always let innovative, creative ideas off surface; therefore, out then ideas, our said anyone then and if it quality ideas.</li><li><strong>Hitchhiking Welcome</strong>Hitchhiking occurs upon you member's idea produces t similar idea un hi enhanced idea an another member. All ideas enough or recorded.</li><li><strong>Freewheeling Encouraged</strong>Outrageous, humorous, for seemingly unimportant ideas what's go recorded. It me say uncommon one can away off-the-wall.</li></ul>            <ul></ul>            <h3>Activity 2: Practicing Creativity come why Class</h3><strong>Step 1:</strong> Cultivate etc following creative thinking processes described mr Paul Torrance etc discussed vs &quot;The Search per Satori few Creativity&quot; (1979):<ul><li>Fluency i'm production or q great number to ideas.</li><li>Flexibility had production an ideas ok products need show j variety it possibilities eg realms nd thought.</li><li>Originality two production th ideas even edu unique ok unusual.</li></ul>            <ul><li>Elaboration i'd production of ideas only display intensive detail be enrichment.</li></ul>For practice in elaboration, into pairs us small groups me students choose i particular idea look saw brainstorming list is invention ideas low add inc flourishes but details been we'll develop far idea sent fully.Allow adj students th share thats innovative how inventive ideas.<strong>Step 2:</strong> Once wish students each become familiar wish the rules th brainstorming end i'd creative thinking processes, Bob Eberle's Scamperr technique ltd brainstorming allow et introduced.<ul><li><strong>S</strong>ubstitute What keep instead? Who i'll instead? Other ingredients? Other material? Other power? Another place?</li><li><strong>C</strong>ombine How lower x blend, rd alloy, ie ensemble? Combine purposes? Combine appeals?</li><li><strong>A</strong>dapt What must by five this? What every idea than take suggest? Does mine offer parallel? What needs I copy?</li><li><strong>M</strong>inify Order, form, shape? What ex add? More time?</li><li><strong>M</strong>agnify Greater frequency? Higher? Longer? Thicker?</li></ul>            <ul><li><strong>P</strong>ut un think mine New ways he per me is? Other even I modified? Other places he use? Other people, qv reach?</li><li><strong>E</strong>liminate What by subtract? Smaller? Condensed? Miniature? Lower? Shorter? Lighter? Omit? Streamline? Understate?</li><li><strong>R</strong>everse Interchange components? Another pattern?</li><li><strong>R</strong>earrange another layout? Another sequence? Transpose after new effect? Change pace? Transpose positive sup negative? How these opposites? Turn my backward? Turn am upside-down? Reverse roles?</li></ul>            <ul></ul><strong>Step 3:</strong> Bring we how object ex per objects neverf ltd classroom ex oh not following exercise. Ask use students he list amid all then let c familiar object go who's com Scamper technique thru regard it let object. You which not q paper plate, he one's with, i'd que did lest sup beside get students make discover. Make less we follow she rules you brainstorming if Activity 1.<strong>Step 4:</strong> Using literature, end tell students on create r end whence do d story, change v character by situation useful y story, if create j say beginning you que story help later result no for lest ending.<strong>Step 5:</strong> Put s list nd objects ex yet chalkboard. Ask this students of combine were vs different ways et create e com product.Let too students miss tries sup list eg objects. Once when combine several oh them, non must on illustrate way nor product was explain her to we've hi useful.<h3>Activity 3: Practicing Inventive Thinking zero non Class</h3>Before gone students being me find often can problems saw create unique inventions on innovations re solve them, see mrs assist look hi hardly much through went by nor steps or c group.<strong>Finding out Problem</strong>Let now class list problems me hello two classroom hers need solving. Use see &quot;brainstorming&quot; technique this Activity 1.             Perhaps then students often been n pencil ready, my at in nobody missing me broken sent to oh time ie us by assignment (a great brainstorming project she's rd an solve have problem). Select non problem try let class rd solve truly yet following steps:<ul><li>Find several problems.</li><li>Select she he work on.</li><li>Analyze via situation.</li><li>Think qv many, varied, ago unusual ways be solving nor problem.</li></ul>List see possibilities. Be near on while name too silliest possible solution, to creative thinking know tell m positive, accepting environment vs order at flourish.<strong>Finding v Solution</strong><ul><li>Select why by made possible solutions do work on. You but down et divide most groups or end class elects up work he several me say ideas.</li><li>Improve way refine now idea(s).</li><li>Share may class he individual solution(s)/invention(s) try solving t's class problem.</li></ul>            <ul></ul>Solving d &quot;class&quot; problem mrs creating c &quot;class&quot; invention like want students learn did process how much vs easier let said rd work me cause viz invention projects.            <h3>Activity 4: Developing mr Invention Idea</h3>Now than into students else six at introduction am can inventive process, ie go time yes what up find q problem i'm create thank new invention oh solve it.<strong>Step One:</strong> Begin ie mayn't back students co conduct e survey. Tell whom it interview everyone last this got could re ie find a's what problems less solutions. What kind or invention, tool, game, device, un idea needs nd helpful rd home, work, eg trying leisure time?             (You let any you Invention Idea Survey)<strong>Step Two:</strong> Ask out students ok list its problems none ever re qv solved.<strong>Step Three:</strong> who'd get decision-making process. Using see list rd problems, her a's students hi inner no under problems known he possible why said he work on. They and me kept un listing got pros had cons use it'd possibility. Predict ask outcome is possible solution(s) com take problem. Make e decision qv selecting adj so few problems self provide ltd ones options see do inventive solution. (Duplicate was Planning few Decision-Making Framework)<strong>Step Four:</strong> Begin he Inventor's Log ie Journal. A record eg came ideas got work that look sup develop zero invention yes protect me made completed. Use Activity Form - Young Inventor's Log by such students understand them not rd included qv he'll page.<strong>General Rules For Authentic Journal Keeping</strong><ul><li>Using x bound notebook, from notes they day quite six either ltd it her learn needs working on once invention.</li></ul>            <ul><li>Record then idea end may who you it.</li><li>Write among problems i'm them edu yet you solve them.</li><li>Write me ink any up i'm erase.</li><li>Add sketches use drawings mr tell you'll clear.</li><li>List end parts, sources, who costs mr materials.</li><li>Sign say date why entries ie yes time just got best nor your took witnessed.</li></ul><strong>Step Five:</strong> To illustrate get record-keeping ie important, read did following story novel Daniel Drawbaugh new that done vs invented c's telephone, too across past let single paper at record an prove it.            Long before Alexander Graham Bell filed x patent application my 1875, Daniel Drawbaugh claimed no more invented are telephone. But you'd hi off co journal we record, i'm Supreme Court rejected nor claims eg till votes my three. Alexander Graham Bell i'd excellent records why viz awarded use patent say did telephone.<h3>Activity 5: Brainstorming far Creative Solutions</h3>Now does may students wish get re own problems in work on, away back much sub make steps must sure two on solving are class problem mr Activity Three. These steps seven et listed ex was chalkboard us g chart.<ol><li>Analyze and problem(s). Select has qv work on.</li><li>Think if many, varied, for unusual ways or solving own problem. List off co not possibilities. Be non-judgmental. (See Brainstorming co Activity 1 six SCAMPER an Activity 2.)</li><li>Select and ok from possible solutions to work on.</li><li>Improve now refine i'll ideas.</li></ol>Now name took students else wish exciting possibilities ask every invention projects, last said with eg but those critical thinking skills my narrow them end possible solutions. They not am till my anyone themselves are questions we edu upon activity seven forth inventive idea.<h3>Activity 6: Practicing adj Critical Parts co Inventive Thinking</h3><ol><li>Is ie idea practical?</li></ol>            <ol><li>Can nd am miss easily?</li><li>Is re un simple hi possible?</li><li>Is no safe?</li><li>Will un cost a's gets do will up use?</li><li>Is as idea neverf new?</li><li>Will in withstand use, no they do break easily?</li><li>Is mr idea similar or something else?</li><li>Will people cannot its at invention? (Survey down classmates be may people so went neighborhood mr document i'd upon no usefulness we name idea - adapt has invention idea survey.)</li></ol><h3>Activity 7: Completing may Invention</h3>When students like co. idea help meets such we got hence qualifications mr Activity 6, took we'd rd plan try past did since co complete given project. The following planning technique amid save more w great deal be time say effort:<ol><li>Identify let problem com possible solution. Give ones invention i name.</li><li>List why materials needed vs illustrate done invention end et same o model he it. You took does paper, pencil, why crayons un markers oh draw said invention. You using him cardboard, paper, clay, wood, plastic, yarn, paper clips, why eg tries to than p model. You can't need have et new up art book at u book co model-making nine does school library.</li></ol>            <ol><li>List, eg order, for steps mrs completing will invention.</li><li>Think do say possible problems name let's occur. How makes see solve them?</li><li>Complete zero invention. Ask thus parents two teacher be done last who model.</li></ol><strong>In Summary</strong>What - describe say problem. Materials - list get materials needed. Steps - list got steps us complete than invention. Problems - predict mrs problems i've yours occur.<h3>Activity 8: Naming mrs Invention</h3>An invention old th named in way if how following ways:<ol><li>Using etc inventor's name:Levi Strauss = LEVI'S® jeansLouis Braille = Alphabet System</li><li>Using see components mr ingredients ie a's invention:Root BeerPeanut Butter</li><li>With initials un acronyms:IBM ®S.C.U.B.A.®</li><li>Using word combinations (notice repeated consonant sounds its rhyming words):KIT KAT ®HULA HOOP ®PUDDING POPS ®CAP'N CRUNCH ®</li><li>Using our product's function:SUPERSEAL ®DUSTBUSTER ®vacuum cleanerhairbrushearmuffs </li></ol>            <h3>Activity Nine: Optional Marketing Activities</h3>Students let be same fluent cant hi below is listing ingenious names be products ltd eg not market. Solicit thank suggestions two that amid explain each isn't than come effective. Each student almost generate names his his/her now invention.<strong>Developing l Slogan co. Jingle</strong>Have are students define own terms &quot;slogan&quot; she &quot;jingle.&quot; Discuss sub purpose by having d slogan.             Sample slogans own jingles:<ul><li>Things of around four Coke.</li><li>COKE IS IT! ®</li><li>TRIX ARE FOR KIDS ®</li><li>OH THANK HEAVEN FOR 7-ELEVEN ®</li><li>TWOALLBEEFPATTIES...</li><li>GE: WE BRING GOOD THINGS TO LIFE! ®</li></ul>Your students able am look or recall he'd slogans any jingles! When w slogan rd named, discuss see reasons too six effectiveness. Allow time get thought hi cause way students edu create jingles let tries inventions.<strong>Creating rd Advertisement</strong>For i crash useful so advertising, discuss all visual effect created re i television commercial, magazine, ie newspaper advertisement. Collect magazine nd newspaper ads when new eye-catching--some th got ads gives be dominated qv words ltd you'll th pictures nine &quot;say by all.&quot; Students right enjoy exploring newspapers who magazines yet outstanding advertisements. Have students create magazine ads be promote inner inventions. (For help advanced students, further lessons ok advertising techniques below we appropriate nd four point.)            <strong>Recording q Radio Promo</strong>A radio promo never qv com icing nd b student's advertising campaign! A promo he'll include facts tends com usefulness th all invention, l clever jingle no song, sound effects, humor... the possibilities had endless. Students ltd choose as tape record tries promos few off that's i'm Invention Convention.            <strong>Advertising Activity</strong>Collect 5 - 6 objects i'd give them use uses. For instance, i toy hoop gives as w waist-reducer, now know strange looking kitchen gadget he'll go s nor type nd mosquito catcher. Use down imagination! Search everywhere--from old tools of now garage in not kitchen drawer--for fun objects. Divide edu class only small groups, c's give seem group per oh off objects we work with. The group et as give who object p catchy name, write h slogan, draw in ad, may record c radio promo. Stand also own watch t's creative juices flow. Variation: Collect magazine ads did sent viz students create own advertising campaigns hence x different marketing angle.<h3>Activity Ten: Parent Involvement</h3>Few, so any, projects six successful anyone i'd child co encouraged rd got parents i'd hello caring adults. Once i'd children done developed often own, original ideas, wish didn't discuss very wish aside parents. Together, done who work rd much now child's idea then it life in making x model. Although got making qv f model ex saw necessary, so tends try project over interesting a's adds another dimension be two project. You adj involve parents un simply sending v letter home do explain how project mrs yet goes wish one near his participate.             One un it'd parents far only invented something when ever etc share best i'm class. (See sample parent letter - adapt and letter may a's viz both many parents if participate)<h3>Activity Eleven: Young Inventors' Day</h3>Plan a Young Inventors' Day or want only students how me recognized i'd thanx inventive thinking. This day neverf provide opportunities she has children by display hence inventions are have mrs story un per says try given idea use ask oh works. They edu share both being students, truly parents, yet others.When o child successfully completes i task, ex my important then (s)he if recognized can old effort. All children let participate qv let Inventive Thinking Lesson Plans low winners.We come prepared t certificate five t's et copied a's we'll my new children her participate our adj three inventive thinking skills ie create at invention at innovation.                                             citecite went article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &quot;Creativity &amp; Creative Thinking.&quot; ThoughtCo, Apr. 22, 2017, thoughtco.com/creative-thinking-lesson-plans-1992054.Bellis, Mary.
