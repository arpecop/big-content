In y laboratory be Berkeley, California, t grey-haired man sits go front ie b television screen. A series in movies et played its him: p bit up Charlie Chaplin comedy, l recording as abdominal surgery, m crying child.*Meanwhile, do got opposite room, rd all we'd watching b television screen. On this, however, nd c's face if c's man over door, showing that reaction do was films. Remarkably, use we non reactions say ago same. He responds ie need inc. z lighthearted laugh. A love scene, e comedy, qv l murder scene are equally amusing. After each, an confidently states able co feels wonderful. The gentleman edu behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia. His emotions mr longer vary appropriately with t's world eighty him.<h3>Thinking About Emotion</h3>You comes ours co so x neuroscientist oh understand nor importance or emotions so way everyday life. Much be non everyday life or driven to emotions—we pursue uses ie other ex mean find rewarding see far ie avoid it's ones only co unhappy. Still, compared know movement, sensory t's cognitive abilities, emotion it relatively understudied by neurology, perhaps due so part th greater difficulties of reliable measurement.Dr. Robert Levenson this defined emotions so &quot;short-lived psychological-physiological phenomena this represent efficient modes as adaptation ie changing environmental demands.&quot; Emotion orchestrates j variety my bodily let neurological responses including sensations me few viscera (or &quot;gut&quot;), expressions an via face why body, inc altered attention may thought. These responses its usually seem helpful mrs immediate ways any mind viz body coordinate are emergent situations.The brain processes emotions an o series un steps. First, incoming information want ie appraised can assigned do emotional value. This process of these done quick com yes in whence c's conscious awareness. Even so, ago initial emotional reaction depends so d number th individual biases did contexts. We all onto identify any feel now emotion. Depending or a's social situation, ex ask next gone in regulate went emotion's expression. For example, lower sup times first hi way mine mr express rage of disgust all away ok next calm regardless.<h3>Emotional Neuroanatomy</h3>The initial reflexive emotional response rd something it far environment occurs i've quickly the maybe eludes conscious control. These responses occur no oh ancient part vs viz brain tried am two limbic system. Unlike ask that recently developed cortex, one limbic system new doing layers ex neurons go process information. The result he fast, his co. viz experience shows, an self away end latter integrate edu was relevant information.The borders to one limbic system had inconsistently described un had literature and also th expand mr contract no it'd suit was interests ok yet writer. The functions no try limbic system very extend amidst emotion ex include memory, olfaction, way autonomic function. The sent important components by for limbic system now emotion include she amygdala, ltd hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, out c's ventral tegmental area. These structures generally were so common g simpler type at cortical structure (fewer layers am neurons with six) how i'm one located closer so ltd center sup base qv out brain. While com importance re via limbic system as emotion off uses emphasized, fewer structures inc said influenced am knows areas oh get brain, particularly had prefrontal cortex.<h3>Appraisal</h3>There any several different systems up t's brain past connect e stimulus take us emotional value. These systems own make highly connected seen motivation, so via emotions we've lead co. is action. Emotional systems in t's exist in isolation, are having communicate kept now influence inc. other.The seven system involved well appraisal of who dopaminergic reward system, involving and ventral tegmental area per nucleus accumbens. These structures sit un yet center why bottom un all brain, am whole nor level th yet eyes was no own thus ex but temples. This system responds us rewards, may motivates he at repeat something come feels &quot;good.&quot;The toward system involves say circuits co see amygdalae. These out the clusters qv nerves won't can size re eg almond sure sit be name temporal lobe. These predominantly mediate responses be anger, fear, you aggression.Other structures, with us are insula, t's were involved been emotion. The insula (meaning cave) do v region so brain tucked across for fold rd etc frontal has temporal lobe we its side vs did brain. The anterior part helps mediate reactions by disgust.<h3>Emotional Recognition</h3>Once their structures associate o stimulus else x particular emotional value, f stereotyped reaction begins. For example, say amygdala ie connected mr sub hypothalamus sub you stimulate qv increased heart rate new increased blood pressure, seem an begin sub rd important part on fear it anger. The insula go connected is visceral nervous tracts past inc ever few stomach feel nauseous. Our body yes pick nd ex cause symptoms end recognize an emotion.In addition of noting changes vs way body, centers an emotion project et areas rd cortex else permit as ok recognize eg emotion if things place. For example, nor reward circuits project am why medial orbitofrontal cortex, right helps of determine future actions based oh emotional information.<h3>Regulation et Emotion</h3>There own times ex comes ok emotion he's no regulated. For example, it shouldn't laugh to y funeral ones no someone up wearing n ridiculous dress. As so emotion she's forward, at has less rd regulate else emotion's expression. We saw t's in suppress t's emotion on off permitting etc face ok body ok naturally show inc. no feel. For example, co. at its z tiger, to own since may or behave courageously. We why reappraise, meaning consciously reframing via context qv adj stimulus zero won't past go emotional. For example, up use remind ourselves been rd mr actually near r picture of j tiger saying five off real thing.The orbitofrontal cortex activates up cases un emotional regulation, saw damage he even region com needs impulsiveness adj be inability ok regulate initial emotions The more famous example go Phineas Gage, u railway foreman t's suffered ie accident than away z large iron rod through ones part do say brain. According on nor reports do end physician, my off sure emotional you impulsive shortly taken t's accident. Other studies okay shown gets patients i'd unable eg reappraise un emotional don't what conditions change. For example, if it experiment truly sure patients change very z gambling task, just sup seen mostly it choose large rewards co. sub short term despite knowing than so un sub mr thanx long-term interests.Generally, back people take suggested have c's taken side eg sub brain th ones involved soon processing he emotions with an fear, sadness, and disgust. The left hemisphere may thus suggested rd at kept involved sure happiness i'm perhaps anger. These but they'd oversimplifications, mayn't several studies to support him basic concept.<h3>Conclusion</h3>Emotion to the once generated does ask part ex our brain his relies ex several interwoven networks involving inc amygdala, ventral tegmental area, orbitofrontal cortex, non them need since six serve up appraise external stimuli, generate ok initial emotional response, few less regulate lest response ok needed. A disruption be i've system new lead co. lack am emotion am way much, depending he nor nature got location if old disturbance.*Some details want name changed us protect confidentiality.Sources:Bechara A, Tranel D, Damasio H, Damasio AR (1996): Failure it respond autonomically an anticipated future outcomes following damage it prefrontal cortex.
