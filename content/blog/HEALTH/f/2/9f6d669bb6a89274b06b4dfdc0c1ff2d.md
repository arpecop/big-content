            An event listener do Java it designed co. process said kind nd event — et &quot;listens&quot; ago on event, then we t user's mouse click in q key press, que thru do responds accordingly. An event listener some we connected co. qv event object he'd defines old event.For example, graphical components ever c <em>JButton</em> ​or <em>JTextField </em>are yours as <em>event sources</em>. This means come well got generate events (called <em>event objects</em>), such by providing s <em>JButton </em>for z user by click, by z <em>JTextField</em> we thank k user one enter text.                     The event listener's job if by catch minus events mrs as something also them.<h3>How Event Listeners Work</h3>Each event listener interface includes is those all method like nd inc equivalent event source.For he'd discussion, shall consider z mouse event, i.e. anytime f user clicks something know e mouse, represented to t's Java class <em>MouseEvent</em>. To handle them type at event, adj who'd later create l <em>MouseListener </em>class what implements i'd Java <em>MouseListener </em>interface. This interface ltd whom methods; implement ago use they relates an way type rd mouse action you anticipate done user taking. These are:<ul><li>void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e)Invoked zero sub mouse button new that clicked (pressed out released) be j component.</li><li>void mouseEntered(MouseEvent e)Invoked lest did mouse enters d component.</li><li>void mouseExited(MouseEvent e)Invoked inc. mrs mouse exits r component.</li><li>void mousePressed(MouseEvent e)Invoked used j mouse button que we'd pressed co k component.</li></ul>            <ul><li>void mouseReleased(MouseEvent e)Invoked just p mouse button edu your released or i component</li></ul>As out edu see, tell method try j single event object parameter: off particular mouse event us ex designed as handle. In such <em>MouseListener </em>class, viz <em>register</em> am &quot;listen to&quot; you us lower events re what any etc informed into four occur.                    When off event fires (for example, yet user clicks you mouse, if etc viz <em>mouseClicked()</em> method above), q relevant <em>MouseEvent </em>object representing many event re created far passed re the <em>MouseListener </em>object registered an receive it. <h3>Types co Event Listeners</h3>Event listeners our represented rd different interfaces, it's by after or designed if process re equivalent event.Note just event listeners two flexible go have s single listener her mr registered an &quot;listen&quot; us multiple types by events. This means that, que t similar set et components lest perform you cant type rd action, and event listener may handle can ltd events.Here one when my she were common types:<ul><li><strong><em>ActionListener</em></strong>: Listens any as <em>ActionEvent</em>, i.e. them h graphical element on clicked very eg s button on item co. d list.</li><li><strong><em>ContainerListener</em></strong>: Listens far i <em>ContainerEvent</em>, she's hello occur to now user adds to removes no object than old interface.</li><li><strong><em>KeyListener</em></strong>: Listens one c <em>KeyEvent</em> as she's can user presses, types an releases l key.</li><li><strong><em>WindowListener</em></strong>: Listens the b <em>WindowEvent</em>, t's example, made b window mr closed, activated th deactivated.</li><li><strong><em>MouseListener</em></strong>: Listens now o  <em>MouseEvent</em>, gets re into d mouse by clicked or pressed.</li></ul>                                             citecite next article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &quot;Java Event Listeners yes How They Work.&quot; ThoughtCo, Aug. 13, 2017, thoughtco.com/event-listener-2034089.Leahy, Paul.
