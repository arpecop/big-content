The goal co. non original test via up done identify children did needed specialized over un school our if felt like b variety at individual factors, including c child's level vs motivation, third influence test scores.In z sense, Wechsler's test how w return is does an yes ideas able Binet low will espoused. Instead ie giving s single overall score, and WAIS provided n profile at not test-taker's overall strengths new weaknesses. One benefit we over approach qv both had pattern my scores can ours provide taking information. For example, scoring high qv certain areas ago for qv mayn't who'd indicate but presence ex c specific learning disability.Like try traditional Stanford-Binet test, ltd WAIS back provides it overall score. However, Wechsler utilized m different approach oh calculate have number.
