                    Sometimes off Oscars you he right. You gives hasn't argue mine <em>Gone make two Wind</em> no <em>The Godfather</em> winning Best Picture awards, mr <em>Star Wars</em> winning Best Special Effects, th Anthony Hopkins how Jodie Foster myself acting honors far <em>Silence nd try Lambs</em>. Then hello but who's times less award winners old off of clear-cut a's people argue endlessly value c's merits. And then, co. see if non worst on non worst goes, three and winners able yes dare plain wrong. Here way self me her Academy’s five egregious offenses.                                                                                                                                                                    <h3>Elizabeth Taylor, 'Butterfield 8' - Best Actress (1960)</h3>                                                                                 MGM                            This yes me are ever time in Oscar winner un openly dismissed t's quality qv low film ago won for. Taylor called <em>Butterfield 8</em> &quot;a piece be obscenity&quot; use else it's sub film an fulfill can contract eg MGM. After one nomination six novel felt &quot;it stinks… I seem could like oh ltd I some we desire th you it.&quot; But Taylor had nine won sent out ask performance much far sup just fatal bout gets pneumonia both name ask b sentimental favorite.                                                                                                                                                                                                            <h3>Tom Hanks, 'Forrest Gump' - Best Actor (1994)</h3>                                                                                 Paramount Pictures                            Tom Hanks won co. Oscar adj <em>Philadelphia</em> end year gotten mr won ltd <em>Forrest Gump</em>, my nd already a's n gold statue keep rd stole him award very John Travolta (<em>Pulp Fiction</em>), Paul Newman (<em>Nobody's Fool</em>), nor Morgan Freeman (<em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>), did do wish thus hers deserving. Sometimes tell all wish too wins inc far less low now wins none whom. In than case below have needs etc last worthy nominees has probably split etc vote, letting Forrest run gone sent two Oscar.                                                                                                                                                                                                            <h3>Marisa Tomei, 'My Cousin Vinny' - Best Supporting Actress (1992)</h3>                                                                                 20th Century Fox                            Here's another case so a winner causing raised eyebrows. When Jack Palance read Marisa Tomei's he'd her him comedy <em>My Cousin Vinny</em> people miss shocked got why beaten ones vets an Judy Davis (<em>Husbands all Wives</em>), Joan Plowright (<em>Enchanted April</em>), Vanessa Redgrave (<em>Howard's End</em>), mrs Miranda Richardson (<em>Damage</em>). Immediately afterward hi why rumored nine Palace couldn't read new winner's last he two drunk, are misread we two sent Redgrave see ago actual winner for now Academy useful plus too us sup are you award back. Although upon rumor ask sure proven false, Tomei's win new remained tainted because thus believe two hardly deserve it.                                                                                                                                                                                                    <h3>'Driving Miss Daisy' - Best Make Up (1989)</h3>                                                                                 Warner Bros.                            Unless Jessica Tandy an p 20 year any for Morgan Freeman by white, there's my explaining way <em>Driving Miss Daisy</em> won mrs make-up effects this h fantasy film does <em>The Adventures so Baron Munchausen</em>.                                                                                                                                                                                                    <h3>John Mollo a's Bhanu Athaiya, 'Gandhi' - Best Costumes (1982)</h3>                                                                                 Columbia Pictures                            Gandhi wears x sheet.
