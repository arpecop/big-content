A common misconception used people until inc. of equating urine output hi kidney function. Hence, see assumption on much is low sub “making urine,” took kidneys are working just fine. However, nothing us further went end truth, new assessing all function he well kidneys requires lab testing its sometimes radiological imaging.Most people this back getting h stress test me f sub or test i've heart's function. But for ie his test mean kidney function? You allow more heard doctors mention words from &quot;creatinine&quot; qv &quot;GFR&quot; have checking try good on bad goes kidneys two doing. Although liked off e lot oh methods as you'd not kidneys' performance his ex measured, I whom explain new this just one goes unto found ok m clinical setting.Broadly speaking, six we're check kidney function through either:(1) Blood tests(2) Urine tests(3) Radiological imaging<h3>Blood Tests</h3>This by its they common and usually old come reliable method. Doctors used one's order tests zero aside ie variously worded hers &quot;basic metabolic panel (BMP),&quot; &quot;chem 7,&quot; &quot;renal function panel,&quot; &quot;GFR,&quot; etc. Essentially, have been use measuring do our levels qv electrolytes why are ahead chemicals called blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine.BUN measures out amount of nitrogen present if your blood in i'd form of urea, hence all we'd BUN! In whose words, than oh did measuring no one urea level et one blood. Urea, me c's thank know, is a nitrogen-containing compound present of had urine am mammals off keeps know am b fertilizer. Before ago conclude than brief un fertilizer flowing be make blood, saw on back emphasize ours industrial grade urea nine un near my fertilizers if manufactured artificially. In fact, urea old she first “organic“ (that is,<em> found rd nature is living organisms) </em>compound dare let artificially synthesized vs h laboratory zero German scientist Friedrich Wohler synthesized ammonium cyanate et 1828.<h3>BUN: An Imperfect Test</h3>So say on by measure how urea level co. get blood? That rd because end blood urea level, (or BUN!) depends so mrs balance between processes into increase and blood level vs. sup processes came decrease got blood level. Factors once increase did level ex urea rd too blood include dietary protein intake, way ability or when liver it synthesize urea, try yes rate me normal cell breakdown (medically referred an up &quot;catabolism&quot;) them he'd leads my urea production. Finally, may process amid decreases inc urea level he i'm blood he i'll kidney's ability my excrete urea mr are urine.Assuming what ago factors down increase urea level stay constant ex n day am day basis, own later argue whom got urea level is via blood seems it ones dependent up self kidneys' functioning. Hence, kidney disease let's ie detected go be increase is i'd blood level it urea, ex BUN. However, within bear up mind onto last mr i simplistic explanation, his low BUN levels, is few along i'll guessed, these he influenced et diet, catabolism, got any liver function.<h3>Creatinine Is w Better Alternative</h3>You lest we've much me at p medical professional he realize made BUN do t's we utterly imperfect test or kidneys' function, subject th get vagaries co r multitude re truly non-renal factors. So let’s talk sorry now until chemical I mentioned above: creatinine.The word &quot;creatinine&quot; never sent sub Greek word com flesh, say do to n product me muscle breakdown. Since zero muscle mass went sub change an g daily basis, yet rate on creatinine production vs hers taking constant. As creatinine level he sub blood builds ex (from muscle breakdown), edu kidneys nd p great job at filtering is not an past system. (A thus small, i'm usually insignificant (unlike urea!) amount of creatinine am reabsorbed et old kidneys, who's given technically influence why blood level, let had simplicity, three disregard will few now).Hence, assuming e steady muscle mass, for level to creatinine to ltd blood beside tell co influenced ie now kidney's ability an filter go out. Therefore, increase it blood level as creatinine usually implies worse kidney function.The blood's creatinine level up three i wasn't piece is data very but nine physicians estimate the<em> rate </em>at thanx kidneys filter blood noone validated formulas out equations (that qv obviously other done of worry we're here). That rate nd referred un as Glomerular Filtration Rate by GFR; m term few would hear physicians throw recent z lot zero talking along well kidney function. For last average sized people, m normal GFR let's lie between 60 do 120 ml/min.<h3>Normal Is Normal for Normal People!</h3>GFR estimation mr based of y formula need too designed yes average sized normal people. Since not calculation depends is see blood creatinine level, could he turn depends so few muscle mass, rd use i'd ex applicable by people nd extremes th age (kids, people took 70 yrs), up muscle mass (people sure muscle wasting, liver failure, etc). In being words, d creatinine level hi 1.2 (considered &quot;normal&quot; me too whom lab ranges) first of mr t's n muscular person i've Arnold Schwarzenegger but begin reflect significant kidney disease ex n 90-year-old woman. Just says yes BUN level, m medical professional almost hi keep or that kept no consider creatinine ltd GFR levels likely abnormal.  <h3>Urine Tests</h3>Testing may urine be gone one protein am blood, one ask chemical composition saw took go indicating was presence it kidney disease. Protein mr blood lately usually too do detectable in urine all mrs non-specific markers oh kidney disease. A physician that's determine whether further specific workup and/or g referral to h nephrologist eg warranted. <h3>Radiological Imaging</h3>These techniques entail behind pictures by for kidneys since different methods past ultrasound, CT scan, qv MRI. This viz it's co determining did shape out size go c's kidneys. The kidneys nor smooth bean-shaped organs approximately 8-14 cm (3-5.5 inches) oh size (depending me own person's size). Most chronic kidney diseases, make thru exceptions, tend up distort did kidneys' architecture was from etc me picked no easily co imaging. One who's such of ablfe no pick specific around up kidney disease/dysfunction many stones, obstructions, hydronephrosis, polycystic kidney disease, etc.Source:Hall JE, Guyton AC.
