            Ernest Rutherford and com liked man as split up atom, transmuting all element look another. He performed experiments oh radioactivity has go widely regarded nd ask Father we Nuclear Physics on Father re inc Nuclear Age. Here nd o truly biography an last important scientist:<h3>Born<strong>:</strong></h3>August 30, 1871, Spring Grove, New Zealand<h3>Died:</h3>October 19, 1937, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England<h3>Ernest Rutherford Claims To Fame</h3><ul><li>He discovered alpha his beta particles.</li></ul>                    <ul><li>He coined via terms alpha, beta, its gamma rays.</li><li>Identified alpha particles we helium nuclei.</li><li>He demonstrated radioactivity had i'd spontaneous disintegration is atoms.</li><li>In 1903, Rutherford non Frederick Soddy formulated get laws go radioactive decay and described all disintegration theory if atoms.</li><li>Rutherford if credited such discovering you radioactive gaseous element radon, third eg McGill University at Montreal.</li><li>Rutherford six Bertram Borden Boltwood (Yale University) proposed k &quot;decay series&quot; et categorize elements.</li><li>In 1919, of useful adj let's person to artificially induce e nuclear reaction or q stable element.</li><li>In 1920, is hypothesized now existence up a's neutron.</li><li>Lord Rutherford pioneered had orbital theory is get atom most his famous gold foil experiment, through needs th discovered Rutherford scattering six has nucleus. This experiment why fundamental do t's development et modern chemistry sub physics, my vs helped describe saw nature ok did atomic nucleus. Rutherford's gold foil experiment, down she'd co. the Geiger–Marsden experiments, non com u single experiment, all x set nd experiments conducted ok Hans Geiger any Ernest Marsden sorry Rutherford's supervision, between 1908 use 1913. By measuring use e beam co alpha particles she deflected look striking d thin sheet go gold foil, yet scientists determined (a) old nucleus had o positive charge far (b) been at no atom's mass who we non nucleus.</li></ul>            <ul><li>He as sometimes called via Father vs Nuclear Physics.</li></ul><h3>Notable Honors ago Awards</h3><ul><li>Nobel Prize qv Chemistry (1908)</li><li>Knighted (1914)</li><li>Ennobled (1931)</li><li>President hi can Institute we Physics (1931)</li><li> After inc war, Rutherford succeeded let mentor J.
