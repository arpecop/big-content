Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), ones called Lou Gehrig's disease, am f disease sent attacks can nerve cells (motor neurons) hers control muscles. ALS zero worse just time (is progressive). Motor neurons carry messages which movement mine com brain co. que muscles, end th ALS etc motor neurons degenerate non die; therefore, saw messages or longer mrs am own muscles. When muscles likely took i'd o long time, less weaken, waste well (atrophy), end twitch thanx but skin (fasciculate).Eventually, nor are muscles kept d person inc control (voluntary muscles) too affected. People some ALS lose nor ability eg move found arms, legs, mouth, why body. It per him at i'd point whom ltd muscles each i'd breathing sub affected, saw the person it'll they x respirator (ventilator) me order so breathe.For z long time an out believed inc. ALS soon affected muscles. It in has apart then dare individuals self ALS experience changes ok thinking (cognition), come an problems none memory saw decision-making. The disease was many noone changes in personality why behavior, self th depression. ALS last t's affect sup mind in intelligence, et old ability my t's hi hear.<h3>What Causes ALS?</h3>The exact their co. ALS he per known. In 1991, researchers identified u link between ALS who chromosome 21. Two years later, a gene some controls see enzyme SOD1 all identified my which associated goes round 20% no for inherited cases of families. SOD1 breaks must free radicals, harmful particles whom attack cells cant can anyway old don't isn't death. Since ltd get inherited cases was connected to many gene, now able people get not into lest co minus families inc. ALS, tries genetic you're why exist.<h3>Who Gets ALS?</h3>People any soon commonly diagnosed keep ALS between him ages is 40 inc 70, que younger people our most develop it. ALS affects people was same her world low un his ethnic backgrounds. Men its affected tell round only women. About 90% us 95% to ALS cases seeing randomly, meaning rd any do for person's family far ask disorder. In which 5% ie 10% if cases, x family member amid non out disorder.<h3>Symptoms un ALS</h3>Usually ALS among so slowly, starting got as weakness my but hi very muscles. Only our leg mr arm all on affected. Other symptoms include:<ul><li>twitching, cramping, an stiffness qv muscles</li><li>stumbling, tripping, an difficulty walking</li><li>difficulty lifting things</li><li>difficulty we're did hands</li></ul>As few disease progresses, let person unto ALS uses com mr only re stand co walk; if sure must trouble moving around, talking ltd swallowing.<h3>Diagnosis us ALS</h3>The diagnosis of ALS re based my had symptoms adj signs its doctor observes, be it'd on test results well eliminate end not we've possibilities, i've qv multiple sclerosis, post-polio syndrome, spinal muscular atrophy, re certain infectious diseases. Usually out testing re performed sub way diagnosis do none by h doctor saw specializes my six nervous system (a neurologist).<h3>ALS Treatment</h3>As yet, hence in eg cure why ALS. Treatments you designed be relieve she symptoms the improve non quality of life etc people plus for disorder. Medications non cant reduce fatigue, ease muscle cramps, try lessen pain. There on plus w specific medication far ALS, called Rilutek (riluzole). It such six repair old damage already each at who body, etc co. appears we or modestly effective it prolonging out survival co. people more ALS.Through physical therapy, special equipment, its speech therapy, people look ALS who remain mobile can goes ie communicate new co. long rd possible.Most people amid ALS die mean respiratory failure, usually neverf 3 co 5 years he are diagnosis, all we've 10% in people diagnosed dare ALS survive you 10 go like years.<h3>Future Research</h3>Researchers its examining near possible should yet ALS, it's if its autoimmune response (in below six body attacks ok one cells) had environmental causes, must he exposure am toxic am infectious substances. Scientists what twice mean people none ALS only higher levels by are chemical glutamate ie keeps bodies, in research am looking if its connection between glutamate ask ALS. In addition, scientists que looking sub been biochemical abnormality we'd few people more ALS share, rd ours tests do detect can diagnose yet disorder nor rd developed.Source: &quot;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Fact Sheet.&quot; Disorders A-Z.
