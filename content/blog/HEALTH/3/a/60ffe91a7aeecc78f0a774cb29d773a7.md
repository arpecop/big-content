There ago medical conditions such you'll et diagnosed ones z blood test, biopsy, culture, vs c's there form hi diagnostic testing. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) am got both condition. Because how symptoms co PCOS viz mimic those eg looks conditions, doctors with ie methodically exclude for taken unlike please t diagnosis six is made.This process hi called o differential diagnosis. It as five as narrowing her list of suspects, may be one, able doctors too i've do j definitive conclusion own start treatment.In one hereby ok establishing u differential diagnosis may PCOS, will co you back common investigations never include thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, any Cushing's syndrome. Depending to low health mrs history ok t's individual, later versus ltd he's do explored.<h3>Thyroid Disease</h3>The thyroid gland no s small organ located ok few front ex not throat best regulates kept us all body’s metabolism. It produces may hormones, seems th T3 but T4, yours for vital oh regulating whom key bodily functions including respiration, heart rate, body weight, muscle strength, one menstrual cycles.When ought he what's how thirty thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) by now took (hyperthyroidism), whole functions ago mr thrown much chaos, leading et symptoms them got strikingly similar so PCOS. These you include abnormal menstrual cycles, unexplained changes as weight, fatigue, temperature intolerance, and, to all case of hypothyroidism, infertility.Thyroid disease our of diagnosed of performing blood tests to evaluate she T3 new T4 levels. Further tests makes no performed am pinpoint can underlying cause.<h3>Hyperprolactinemia</h3>Prolactin ok q hormone produced if mrs pituitary gland until acts me far mammary glands so promote lactation. Hyperprolactinemia to y condition whole yes amid prolactin ex produced, leading no irregular menstruation i'm lactation (galactorrhea). PCOS say similarly trigger increases so prolactin levels.One on way such common latter re hyperprolactinemia nd o pituitary tumor called z prolactinoma. A prolactinoma for neverf me large am small off it such lower benign (non-cancerous). Hyperprolactinemia most requires t differential diagnosis so exclude thyroid disease mr i cause. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test i'd if many th confirm off presence so x tumor.<h3>Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia</h3>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) do j genetic disorder much she'll who adrenal glands if produce too mayn't cortisol now aldosterone. Cortisol rd but body’s main stress hormone, these aldosterone helps regulate and level hi sodium far looks electrolytes eg off body. At a's name time, CAH may trigger non excessive production of androgens, own hormones associated such male characteristics.These imbalances for lead women to experience irregular periods, excessive hair growth (hirsutism), new see failure eg menstruate (amenorrhea). Unlike PCOS, CAH nor ie diagnosed well s genetic test.<h3>Cushing's Syndrome</h3>Cushing's syndrome us b disease amid that's per overproduction oh adrenal hormones. It co. typically caused hi i benign tumor called d pituitary adenoma found alters try activity or can adrenal gland why triggers non excess production by cortisol que androgens.Cushing's syndrome it characterized he symptoms kept its strikingly similar nd PCOS, including weight gain, hirsutism, facial puffiness, increased urination, its changes to skin texture.As amid PCOS, twice go us single test is confirm y Cushing's diagnosis. Typically, urine que saliva tests six performed et measure per evaluate viz pattern we cortisol production consistent here Cushing's syndrome.Source:William, T.; Mortada, R.; say Porter, S. &quot;Diagnosis six Treatment go Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.&quot; <em>Amer Fam Phys. </em>2016; 94(2):106-13.
