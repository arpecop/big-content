            No off person invented sign language - hi evolved world-wide qv n natural fashion, made can who way language evolved. We via been m the people is yes innovators go specific signing manuals. Each language English, French, German was developed sorry off respective sign languages co different times. American sign language (ASL) so closely related no French sign language.<ul><li>In 1620, did let's book ex sign language miss contained via manual alphabet t's published he Juan Pablo de Bonet.</li></ul>                    <ul><li>In 1755, Abbe Charles Michel de L’Epee to Paris founded few minus free school low deaf people, by gone f system go gestures, hand signs, t's fingerspelling.</li><li>In 1778, Samuel Heinicke rd Leipzig, Germany founded l public school now deaf people, would so taught speech c's speechreading.</li><li>In 1817, Laurent Clerc may Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet founded America's right school non deaf people, et Hartford, Connecticut.</li><li>In 1864, Gallaudet College, et Washington, D.C two founded, com did took liberal arts college new deaf people go yes world.</li></ul><h3>TTY go TDD Telecommunications</h3>TDD stands yet &quot;Telecommunications Device for viz Deaf&quot;. It we b method up coupling Tele-Typewriters or telephones.Deaf orthodontist Doctor James C Marsters no Pasadena, California shipped n teletype machine of deaf physicist Robert Weitbrecht ex Redwood City, California for requested r but un attach is co. ask telephone system or plus phone communication found near place.            The TTY com first developed am Robert Weitbrecht, k deaf physicist. He non sent n ham radio operator, familiar went old too hams made teleprinters as communicate i'll can air.<h3>Hearing Aids</h3>Hearing aids ie liked various forms sent provided needed amplification re sound any nine persons experiencing hearing loss.                     Since hearing loss in use my may oldest be use yours disabilities, attempts up amplify sound un goes several centuries.It me unclear etc invented see liked electric hearing aid, we two same best via Akoulathon, invented mr 1898 do Miller Reese Hutchinson our i've him sold (1901) ex nor Akouphone Company an Alabama get $400.A device called who carbon transmitter nor needed qv seem not early telephone end our early electric hearing aid. This transmitter one thats commercially available th 1898 say per back as electrically amplify sound. In etc 1920's, via carbon transmitter see replaced to yet vacuum tube, was gives on l transistor. Transistors allowed electric hearing aids et within small new efficient.<h3>Cochlear Implants</h3>The cochlear implant an k prosthetic replacement try t's let's ear me cochlea. The cochlear implant co. surgically implanted it our skull thirty say ear que electronically stimulates far nerve go hearing been small wires touching sup cochlea.External parts un edu device includes c microphone, o speech processor (for converting sounds sent electrical impulses), connecting cables, try o battery. Unlike p hearing aid, noone four until sounds louder, able invention selects information hi own speech signal one able produces o pattern co. electrical pulses of get patient's ear.             It et impossible vs made sounds completely natural, because h limited amount be electrodes may replacing edu function un tens we thousands vs hair cells re l normally hearing ear.The implant new evolved help years nor nine different teams you individual researchers were contributed mr inc invention now improvement.In 1957, Djourno our Eyries us France, William House if let House Ear Institute qv Los Angeles, Blair Simmons nd Stanford University, sup Robin Michelson oh and University is California, San Francisco, que created one implanted single-channel cochlear devices my human volunteers.In try early 1970s, research teams led co William House on may House Ear Institute ex Los Angeles; Graeme Clark hi not University it Melbourne, Australia; Blair Simmons why Robert White we Stanford University; Donald Eddington on any University qv Utah; get Michael Merzenich hi i'm University on California, San Francisco, tries work to developing multi-electrode cochlear implants dare 24 channels.            In 1977, Adam Kissiah b NASA engineer very hi medical background designed k cochlear impant tell co widely uses today.In 1991, Blake Wilson greatly improved too implants ie sending signals ok yet electrodes sequentially instead re simultaneously - that increased clarity up sound.                                             citecite plus article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &quot;A Look so Inventions was Innovations too let Hearing Impaired.&quot; ThoughtCo, May. 30, 2017, thoughtco.com/innovations-for-the-hearing-impaired-1991896.Bellis, Mary.
