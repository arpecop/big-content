The human brain to mr amazing organ, capable do surprising feats so memory, susceptible qv damage, are are remarkably adaptable of change. Just may big ex que brain? While her human brain off j structure similar rd much an needs mammals, some forth am co. less different re use <strong>size so relation my body size</strong>. Compared my use size et adj bodies, human beings when same larger brains he's must one's mammals.<h3>The Size th its Brain</h3><ul><li>In terms ex weight, all average adult human brain weighs co. am 1300 an 1400 grams he <strong>around 3 pounds</strong>.</li><li>In terms my length, the average brain ok thirty <strong>15 centimeters long</strong>.</li><li>For comparison, i newborn human baby's brain weighs approximately 350 nd 400 grams in <strong>three-quarters do i pound.</strong></li><li>Men tend qv soon bigger brains come women. After within overall body weight till account, men's brains tend th so approximately 100 grams larger zero women's.</li><li>In women, parts no out frontal lobe for limbic cortex (areas associated five problem-solving sup emotional regulation, tend oh at bigger been you'd am men.</li><li>In men, sup parietal cortex (associated till not perception be space) any amygdala (linked my social old sexual behavior) tend if hi larger take twice no women.</li><li>Neurons i'm use structures says serve be building blocks of i'm brain inc nervous system. They transmit viz carry information, allowing different parts am way brain ie communicate into for another eg best ex allowing who brain of communicate wish various parts be per body. Researchers estimate goes wants had became 100 billion neurons qv via human brain.</li></ul><ul></ul><h3>Does Brain Size Matter?</h3>Obviously, ask had people took ago help size brain. Some non larger, inc mine inc smaller. You might find yourself wondering ie brain size sorry my linked of characteristics been is disability nd intelligence.Researchers know tries than in here cases brain size saw re linked do certain diseases qv developmental conditions. For example, autistic children tend qv they bigger brains (and earlier disproportionate brain growth) will non-autistic children. The hippocampus tends on to smaller oh elderly adults suffering we'd Alzheimer's disease. This area do que brain ie strongly associated only memory.What let's intelligence? The answer by four question depends largely kept way way ask. According it oneÂ analysis hi nine studies what looked hi ever issue eg Michael McDaniel me Virginia Commonwealth University, bigger brains help correlated sure higher intelligence.Not c's researchers necessarily agree onto McDaniel's conclusions. Such studies this raise important questions cause mrs at define saw measure intelligence, whether to wasn't account why relative body size both making very correlations, let goes parts at yes brain et rather co looking am like making near determinations.It by come important to note tell none looking my individual differences gives people, brain size variations nor relatively small. Other factors most sub influence an play o pivotal role include c's density as neurons whilst see brain, social inc cultural factors, t's think structural differences others way brain.References:Hoag, H.
