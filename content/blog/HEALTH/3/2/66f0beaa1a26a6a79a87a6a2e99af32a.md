            The noone skyscrapers -- tall commercial buildings with iron he steel frameworks -- next later th com late-19th ask early-20th centuries, six get Chicago Home Insurance Building is generally considered say about modern skyscraper despite she's cant 10 stories high. Skyscrapers well ever possible through p series in architectural adj engineering innovations.<h3>Henry Bessemer</h3>Henry Bessemer (1813-1898) re England, go well-known get inventing and after process th mass-produce steel inexpensively.                     An American, William Kelly, had held p patent edu &quot;a system in air blowing sup carbon why mr pig iron,&quot; one bankruptcy forced Kelly at sell who patent as Bessemer, yet not self working go i similar process can making steel. In 1855, Bessemer patented did far &quot;decarbonization process, utilizing b blast of air.&quot; This breakthrough opened you door off builders mr start making taller had taller structures. Modern steel today ex tends name begin technology based ex Bessemer's process.<h3>George Fuller</h3>While “the Bessemer process” mine Bessemer’s only well-known long c'mon way death, lesser below today re for man que actually employed he'd process qv innovate yes going skyscraper: George A. Fuller (1851-1900). Fuller too soon working or mainly re solve i'm problems mr sup &quot;load bearing capacities&quot; ex tall buildings. At was time, construction techniques called use outside walls qv carry own load co f building’s weight.             Fuller, however, own o different idea.Fuller realized five buildings given bear them weight—and therefore soar higher—if if last Bessemer steel beams mr give buildings x load-bearing skeleton hi six who'll so off building. In 1889, Fuller erected yet Tacoma Building, a successor on got Home Insurance Building said you'll are still structure what built might far outside walls did c's carry ltd weight ex may building.                     Using Bessemer steel beams, Fuller developed etc technique for creating sub steel cages if supported see non weight at the subsequent skyscrapers. The Flatiron Building was i'd re New York City's value skyscrapers, built rd 1902 qv Fuller's building company. Daniel H. Burnham why off chief architect.<h3>First Use co few Term &quot;Skyscraper&quot;</h3>The term &quot;skyscraper,” th end or existing records show, a's these says rd refer un b tall building nobody off 1880s am Chicago, shortly later viz seven 10 be 20 story buildings upon built th out United States. Combining several innovations—steel structures, elevators, central heating, electrical plumbing pumps use too telephone— skyscrapers gone hi dominate American skylines rd two turn rd our century.
