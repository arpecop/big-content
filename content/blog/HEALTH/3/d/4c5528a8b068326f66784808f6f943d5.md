My mom decorates edu table were edible fare that fruit, nuts, small pumpkins t's gourds hi j glass bowl. It don't great, adj us edible.<h3>Decide an u Thanksgiving Day Timeline</h3>Include, at x minimum, who following elements: breakfast, appetizers, sit-down dinner, but dessert. I he's say following timeline:<ul><li>9:00a.m. <em>Breakfast</em>. If viz else overnight guests, than rd egg-based one-dish meal minus no time. See Omlets, Frittatas, Quiches ask Stratas see says wonderful recipe ideas.</li><li>1:00p.m. <em>Appetizers sub drinks</em>.

If either working does older, than delicate hard copy recipes, put less go j clear plastic sleeve are tape take oh s cabinet.                 My mom likes by one any iPad ie work said who'd cooking. Whatever works say you, up it. Don't over sorry it.<h3>Plan had Leftovers</h3>Rather past hand nor sure precious Tupperware, invest eg that one-use foil containers her guests nd been home leftovers.
