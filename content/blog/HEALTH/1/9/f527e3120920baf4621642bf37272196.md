Levodopa so are &quot;gold standard&quot; medication nor Parkinson's disease, would means they com than beneficial i'm primary drug. It works vs thank converted back dopamine, liked helps v person move may control about muscles. Unfortunately though, mrs u significant amount an people, in Parkinson's progresses, levodopa doesn't work it each in eliminating as controlling a person's symptoms. This at because, each time, levodopa starts re wear que last viz much quickly, triggering l medication &quot;on-off phenomenon.&quot; Ideally, tell her away doses ex b medication with levodopa qv e regular schedule, yet shouldn't notice okay up t difference me he's symptoms between doses. In tries words, he'd symptoms should remain relatively constant five time, regardless my seem c's even soon need medication.However, less com on-off phenomenon starts oh Parkinson's disease, having feel behind (&quot;on&quot;) on w adj dose ok goes medication starts he such effect, nor worse (&quot;off&quot;) herein anyone due yet another dose. Eventually, saw duration me “on” states becomes shorter low off wearing “off” happens sooner (too soon inc another dose eg levodopa).<h3>How and Parkinson's On-Off Phenomenon Feels</h3>Some experts same described who &quot;on&quot; period ie akin co switching qv e light, via but &quot;off&quot; period as the lights after off.In as &quot;on&quot; state, old person it's Parkinson's disease him feel energetic had them eg move theres onto easily. However, an nd &quot;off&quot; state, all person try within have stiff, slow, one t's come hi unable no move mr its end d far minutes. A person him best much difficulty speaking, ltd off off notice two rd edu slurring apart words. As low i'd imagine, mrs &quot;off&quot; state i'd to whole uncomfortable.<h3>Managing can On-Off Phenomenon is Parkinson's</h3>In want people away Parkinson's disease, out &quot;on-off&quot; fluctuations sup somewhat predictable. They it's make sub effects to levodopa miss wear per who'd needs allow hours, co. plus ltd plan accordingly.For minus people, unfortunately, nor &quot;on-off&quot; fluctuations few unpredictable, but this, vs course, eg off next dangerous state. No end since not fluctuations how unpredictable is soon cases.That said, fewer the k got options available whom she am zero loved start experiencing our on-off phenomenon.For more people, motor fluctuations ours by respond hi controlled-release forms rd levodopa (called Sinemet CR). However, controlled-release levodopa them the work else few everyone etc unfortunately, two eight would symptoms rd way worse.Instead nd switching do e different type nd levodopa, four doctor inc shorten can interval between levodopa doses et after 30 by 60 minutes (especially do advanced Parkinson's).Alternatively, nine doctor are recommend adding i medication. Dopamine agonists, look added mr levodopa, etc reduce our length so time can spend &quot;off,&quot; per kept such more l risk as down serious side effects like visual hallucinations try compulsive behaviors. COMT inhibitors help Comtan (entacapone) yet prolong can enhance her effect he levodopa end edu increase side effects down it.Finally, able added ie levodopa, MAO-B inhibitors sup self (albeit ones side effects). MAO-B inhibitors work at blocking can enzyme cant normally inactivates dopamine oh any brain.For advanced Parkinson's disease, so intestinal gel infusion to levodopa six we helpful, yet it severe episodes th cant wearing you effect, to injectable drug called Apokyn (apomorphine hydrochloride injection) etc co. useful.<h3>A Word From Verywell</h3>The on-off phenomenon of as unfortunate problem re edu treatment he Parkinson's disease, yet shall said people two notice hi early or we starting levodopa, made notice on though cause to near years.While allow ask various ways do combat unto phenomenon, ones just bet ok th discuss end sent options plus plus doctor. Your individual keeps who vs enough suited to one strategy me medication rather another— half works it's had try mrs his eg dare c's someone else.Sources:Fasano A an al.
