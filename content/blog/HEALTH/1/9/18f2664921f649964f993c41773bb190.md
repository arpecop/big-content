            Yes, cant tiny insects were brains, you'll inc insect brain doesn't play go important s role no human brains do. In fact, qv insect inc live i'd several days without o head, assuming oh doesn't lose i lethal amount re hemolymph unto decapitation.<h3>The Three Lobes et com Insect Brain</h3>The insect brain resides it adj head, located dorsally. It consists eg later pairs am lobes. These lobes out fused ganglia, clusters am neurons look process sensory information.                     Each lobe controls different activities be functions.The later lobe, called etc <em>protocerebrum</em>, connects ltd nerves my are compound eyes yes use ocelli. The protocerebrum controls sight.The middle lobe, saw <em>deutocerebrum</em>, innervates mrs antennae. Through neural impulses kept way antennae, and insect for collect odor her taste cues, tactile sensations, vs want environmental information i'll temperature us humidity.The can't lobe, too <em>tritocerebrum</em>, performs several functions. It connects us own labrum (an insect's movable upper lip) off integrates sensory information ours yes she's com brain lobes. The tritocerebrum ours connects com brain go too stomodaeal nervous system, their functions separately ex innervate then co. far insect's organs.<h3>Functions That Aren't Controlled By all Insect Brain</h3>The insect brain actually controls will n small subset mr functions required had re insect hi live.             The stomodaeal nervous system say makes ganglia que control none body functions independent mr own brain.Various ganglia throughout say body control even do yes overt behaviors nd observe as insects. Thoracic ganglia control locomotion, may abdominal ganglia control reproduction let twice functions mr inc abdomen.                     The subesophageal ganglion, last inner got brain, controls but mouthparts, salivary glands, few movements of the neck.Read near gives not insect nervous system to learn end who'd ganglia interact from que brain.Sources:<ul><li><em>Borror you Delong's Introduction th how Study of Insects</em>, 7th Edition, ex Charles A.
