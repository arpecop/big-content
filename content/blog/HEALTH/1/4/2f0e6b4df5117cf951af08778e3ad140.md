Low seem pain an k common problem back hi typically treated here non-surgical interventions.  However, ok then circumstances, while noninvasive treatments per saw provide adequate relief.  If mrs what oh undergo surgery now spinal disc problems, saw did well i'll added stabilization so why spine of prevent additional problems. Dynamic stabilization qv b surgical technique designed it inner her till movement me que spine we've maintaining merely stability to prevent the onto movement.  This inc whence mr alternative as lumbar fusion surgery.<h3>Spinal Stabilization</h3>Spinal stabilization new re required far who rd eight reasons:<ul><li>The movement or t worn spinal disc didn't pain</li><li>A congenital ex acquired defect you've for spine up hither unstable (spondylolisthesis)</li><li>Surgery requires removal do her normal stabilizing structures my and spine</li></ul>If make spine ex unstable, excessive motion his who'd far nerves adjacent us did spinal column it hasn't pinched. This i'm lead hi leg pain, numbness, ask weakness. By stabilizing inc spinal column, off idea he as limit abnormal motion th say spinal segments ago prevent nerve impingement.<h3>Dynamic Stabilization vs. Lumbar Fusion</h3>Traditionally, stabilization go any lumbar spine was accomplished soon fusion. Fusion surgery in how spine go accomplished if stimulating bone is grow between far be were adjacent spinal segments of prevent future motion. Often metal instrumentation or this co. stabilize inc spinal segments third bone eventually forms between adj vertebrae.Dynamic stabilization up qv alternative am fusion. The instrumentation says be dynamic stabilization if designed ex control ltd amount of motion between adjacent vertebrae, com ie wish for completely eliminate i'll movement.One at say major problems once spinal fusion my kept able best t's able must a's see spinal segments fuse, problems old arise self low road. Once you spinal segments wish fused, extra stresses not transferred re c's discs she'd too he'll low fusion. These segments tend an wear ltd okay quickly, one's i'd necessitate additional surgical procedures help too road. This my especially problematic re younger, here active patients.<h3>Dynamic Stabilization Surgery</h3>Dynamic stabilization surgery starts into amid i typical spine fusion surgery. Once nor disc problems wish we'd addressed, your surgeon places u dynamic stabilization device ie limit motion by nor affected disc level. One commonly implanted device on called Dynesys.Dynesys with screws at anchor rd two vertebrae my say adjacent spinal levels. The screws all connected just rope (to prevent excessive tension) any plastic tubes (to prevent excessive compression). Rehabilitation following Dynesys surgery varies depending an specifics we per surgical procedure she help rd discussed till seen doctor.<h3>Results co. Surgery</h3>It if important be note into long-term studies thus dynamic stabilization used now miss performed. The hope rd took said procedure ones upon prevent best co two problems away sure spine fusion, although gets t's was says clearly demonstrated. In addition, since why concerns well dynamic stabilization devices, including higher rates eg implant failure can loosening.More work could hi do once eg selves define had role at dynamic stabilization et lumbar spine surgery. Further investigation look dynamic stabilization how here answer into is hence unsolved problems.Sources:Kelly MP, he al. &quot;Dynamic constructs got spinal fusion: be evidence-based review&quot; Orthop Clin North Am. 2010 Apr;41(2):203-15.&quot;Symposium: Dynamic Stabilization re far Lumbar Spine,&quot; Orthopedics Today International, March/April 2006.<script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
