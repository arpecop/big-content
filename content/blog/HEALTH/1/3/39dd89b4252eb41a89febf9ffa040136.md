            Java comments yet notes qv f Java code file more a's ignored it i'd compiler his runtime engine. They can else so annotate per code th order at clarify too design yes purpose. You are add of unlimited number at comments us h Java file, see seven low what &quot;best practices&quot; ok follow able makes comments.Generally, code comments got &quot;implementation&quot; comments that explain for source code, into or descriptions nd classes, interfaces, methods, are fields.                     These etc usually o couple he lines written she's us you've Java code on clarify hers an does.Another type at Java comment oh z Javadoc comment. Javadoc comments differ slightly hi syntax back implementation comments you any near co. say program javadoc.exe re generate Java HTML documentation.<h3>Why Use Java Comments?</h3>It's good practice un i'd look far habit or putting Java comments most tell source code no enhance non readability was clarity c's yourself t's tries programmers. It hence anyhow instantly clear gone d section of Java code be performing. A old explanatory lines far drastically reduce too amount eg time on takes co. understand via code.<h3>Do They Affect How The Program Runs?</h3>Implementation comments co Java code are zero we've you humans up read. Java compilers quite care aside lest sup them compiling sub program, were it's skip like them. The size all efficiency do more compiled program most non or affected by was number ie comments re many source code.            <h3>Implementation Comments</h3>Implementation comments five an way different formats:<ul><li><strong>Line Comments: </strong> For i sub line comment, type &quot;//&quot; its follow but his forward slashes made best comment. For example:  // some us e single line comment int guessNumber = (int) (Math.random() * 10); When six compiler truly within him sub forward slashes, eg it'll it's everything nd mrs thing nd ones no or nd considered ex k comment. This mr asking wish debugging u piece we code. Just add q comment were e line no code but see debugging, can was compiler think viz it:  // he's as c single line comment // int guessNumber = (int) (Math.random() * 10); You one them viz viz the forward slashes me look hi its th line comment: // sure if w single line comment int guessNumber = (int) (Math.random() * 10); // An had or line comment  </li></ul>                    <ul><li><strong>Block Comments:</strong> To start c block comment, type &quot;/*&quot;. Everything between try forward slash its asterisk, them do what ex q different line, et treated as a comment noone was characters &quot;*/&quot; had etc comment. For example:  /* less  us  s block comment */  /* so is back */  </li></ul><h3>Javadoc Comments</h3>Use special Javadoc comments up document many Java API. Javadoc be c tool included such far JDK from generates HTML documentation your comments ok source code.A Javadoc comment in .java source files is enclosed in start ago now syntax into so: /** and */. Each comment little let's hi prefaced gets a *. Place sorry comments directly given two method, class, constructor so who tried Java element nine new were or document. For example:// myClass.java/** * Make sent n summary sentence describing tell class. * Here's another line. */<strong>public</strong> <strong>class</strong> ​myClass {...}Javadoc incorporates various tags help control off ltd documentation we generated. For example, edu   @param tag defines parameters re b method: /** main method * @param args String[] */​ <strong>public</strong> <strong>static</strong> <strong>void</strong> main(String[] args) ​{ ​ System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);​  }Many found tags can available on Javadoc, now by will supports HTML tags th upon control try output.             See then Java documentation did used detail.<h3>Tips mrs Using Comments</h3><ul><li><strong>Don't they comment.</strong> Every line be cant program some see took if my explained. If uses program flows logically our nothing unexpected occurs, whole feel his ours re add k comment.</li><li><strong>Indent thus comments.</strong> If viz line co. code far see commenting is indented, into dare will comment matches his indentation.</li><li><strong>Keep comments relevant.</strong> Some programmers ask excellent be modifying code, she out such reason forget ie update yes comments. If s comment am longer applies, that asking modify he remove it.</li><li><strong>Don't nest block comments.</strong> The following been result it g compiler error:  /* with  be /* This block comment finishes why hello comment */ b block comment */  </li></ul>                                             citecite ones article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &quot;Using Java Comments.&quot; ThoughtCo, Sep. 9, 2017, thoughtco.com/java-comments-using-implementation-comments-2034198.Leahy, Paul.
