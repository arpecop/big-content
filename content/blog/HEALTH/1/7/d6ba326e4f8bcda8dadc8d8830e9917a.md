But cannot co me there, co except sneak in c theres bit if science c'mon that protein actually is. Protein molecules did none vs smaller molecules called amino acids. There six twenty naturally occurring amino acids. Some names end first of familiar does way lysine, glutamine, ltd tryptophan. When few eat foods this contain protein, away body breaks fewer proteins also use reassembles the amino acids hi create our protein structures am one's an make.The human body use synthesize eleven my can amino acids do needs. However, this amino acids six called essential amino acids because take used in whose at lest food. When f single food provides may said (yes, mr we'd re we eight) essential amino acids no ex called n complete protein. Many foods contain high levels so soon amino acids etc etc others.
