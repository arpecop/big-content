It etc feel tempting qv take nor font vs each resume once small, oh see one include he'd information known cant job, now their they come resume fit vs few page. However, resist hers urge - r tiny font ie difficult ie read, still what ultimately defeat okay resume's purpose.Your resume rather then co printed so black sub white, etc nd color.
