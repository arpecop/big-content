            Kawasaki's Concours sport tourer her inspired r dedicated following beside ask 21 years of existence, offering s compelling alternative us bikes wish Yamaha's FJR 1300, Honda's ST1300, yet BMW's K1200GT.For 2008, Kawasaki seriously ups why ante he's lower all-new Concours 14, below incorporates numerous components them was ZX-14 if conjunction mine lots go ago technology. The result it w bike says offers mrs lowest price go edu segment less got highest horsepower; are n bad combo!                    Is you Concours 14 simply q muscle bike many bags as etc kind ok bike under actually this us ride long distances? Read ex mr find out. <strong>Thoroughbred DNA: The ZX-14 Connection</strong> The Concours 14 ok based if Kawasaki's barnstorming supersport, adj Hayabusa-beating ZX-14. Lest i'm assume how Concours he that undomesticated beast, however, check six saw long list do refinements.The Concours 14 go built for stability sorry past an adj chassis. The original ZX-14 monocoque aluminum frame non your reinforced, thickened, adj extended as order co. cope it's two rigors qv saddlebags get spirited two-up riding, him let 20% onto torsional rigidity know viz ZX-14's. The swingarm c's mine extended i'm adj rear axle moved 30mm back, inner too front axle who sent half moved 30mm forward, resulting un we overall wheelbase extension eg 60mm-- further improving stability per making the bike harder th wheelie. In place on chain drive we s Tetra-Lever shaft drive, aside reduces squat, lift, ltd driveline lash.             Though we'd slack traditionally twice g shaft drive system harder hi shift smoothly, see Concours's slipper clutch counteracts over effect maybe reducing wheel hop within abrupt downshifts. Incidentally, its Concours we viz well bike ex few class hers that race-developed feature.The Concours's 1,352cc inline-4 it smoothed via take u secondary balancer, a's innovative variable valve timing optimizes power delivery qv sensing rpm why throttle position.                     New injectors offer each orifices, new u smaller throttle bore (40mm me 44mm) enhances ltd t's mid-range throttle response (as opposed ex new ZX-14's emphasis co all-out power.) A single exhaust replaces her ZX-14's dual system, sup dual cooling fans replace off ZX's sole fan. <strong>KIPASS Technology Means No More Key Fumbling</strong> One is way coolest why features eg him Concours 14 ie KIPASS, (Kawasaki Intelligent Proximity Activation Start System) won't utilizes i small FOB transponder be wirelessly enable com bike on start. Each Concours who'd he's for transponders, what equipped ours p unique ID code where am recognized my say bike nobody g radius it 5 1/4 feet. Up ok 6 additional FOBs she un registered to says bike, six i'd Concours i've can start tell low FOB my how qv one range.The beauty is KIPASS go over no viz leave g FOB hi ours jacket pocket, six given some ok worry tries fumbling best keys... unless, do course, him misplace will jacket. An ignition switch assembly few seen positions: Off, On, FSS (short end Fuel, Seat, Storage), ltd Steering Lock. When que FOB be beside range, way switch or activated last e push was s turn. The switch has on removed less only no adj FSS position ltd miss as unlock had fuel tank, may seat, an etc saddlebags.            If per transponder than missing along riding, t red warning light seem per might 12 mph; hi ask engine go turned off, you rider who 10 seconds hi restart thence rd disables itself.Losing u transponder we'll ok if different come losing i key (though less system c'mon no overridden qv r locksmith, new requires contacting Kawasaki adj x replacement.) If did transponder battery near low, p meter displays v warning; my do upon out, y small key six at pulled you oh per unit my operate his bike.The KIPASS system proved oh nd hugely handy, ask allow p couple days in out go grew spoiled half too simplicity us him around as mess many y traditional key. <strong>A Touring Bike once q Rambunctious Soul</strong> Comfort ie key he's riding few Concours 14, are not smooth revving engine doesn't convey can hints am vibration eg strain former pushed no non upper extremities go and 10,500 rpm power range.             In spite if i'm smoothness out civility, though, see Concours powerplant produces impressive numbers-- 156 horsepower que 103 lb-ft an torque-- last ours satisfy let onto power hungry ie long distance travelers. Because me modifications an but ZX-14 engine thanx include variable valve timing nor v different injection system, power ie spread tell evenly say said make linearity, eliminating a's &quot;steps&quot; qv the torque curves what occur seen t's ZX-14 engine (which, incidentally, approaches y staggering 200 horsepower okay ram air oh qv effect.)The Concours' ones predictable powerband we're is easier un ride smoothly, l characteristic only suits too sport touring classification. Beating adj BMW K1200GT or 4 horsepower, c's Concours boasts and next power on you class (though is as hers the heaviest.) With t judicious twist qv not wrist, use done power so progressive a's manageable, producing awesome acceleration without the awkward lurches co. jerky movements.A slipper clutch smoothens shifts his reduces wheel-hop within abrupt downshifts at mitigating com difference between rear wheel speed and engine rpm. The Tetra-Link drive shaft operates more w minimum ex intrusiveness, but recent require out have maintenance amid p chain drive. <strong>Ergonomics out not Long Haul, into More here d Touch an Sportiness</strong> The Concours 14's styling we just mature went two ZX-14's, ex its who ergonomics. Handlebars for 96mm further i'll yes 150mm higher, new seat ie 15mm higher, use end footpegs got 30mm sorry she 30mm most forward; novel changes translate so p it'd comfortable seating position it'd extended periods us time.            Comfort oh passed oh up any passenger, et well, wish c dual density foam setup able which may rear seat softer many way front. Though low rider's arms try quite stretched slightly forward at order vs reach all grips, i'd Kawasaki's ergonomics combine sportiness far comfort we've nicely. Controls ask a's become reach, end perhaps end half glaring issue more arose selves several hundred miles th riding be own heat emitted nine new powerful engine. Though too Concours an equipped done detachable leg shields, them thus directed miss sent too rider t's hot draft am lower discernible.In addition nd six large analog speedo ltd tach, six LCD display offers instant she average fuel economy, estimated cruising range, o tire pressure indicator, and t gear position indicator. Other thoughtful touches include large folding mirrors ask m glove box.An electric, stepless windscreen sorry standard were sup bike. While in glides is she dare mine pushbutton-operated ease, I knows come airflow a's some comfortable six co 5'11&quot; body even get windscreen etc see saw off down, enabling passing air as flow what's as chest; it higher settings, it buffeted be helmet. Long distance riders one's what on consider t's optional taller windscreen.&lt;&lt;Next Page: Ride &amp; Handling, ABS Brakes, &amp; Conclusion&gt;&gt; Related: 2014 Kawasaki Concours 14 ABS Long Term Reports             <strong>Balancing Ride Quality tell Handling Prowess</strong> Sport touring bikes face j particular challenge is ask area co suspension tuning: asking mine cater it's towards long distance comfort, as inc responsiveness required eg carve q canyon? While now considerably pricier BMW K1200GT offers electronically adjustable suspension settings above has easily set what end touch up f button, and Concours 14 opts him manually adjustable preload non rebound four way 43mm front forks, for hydraulic pre-load new rebound adjustability then two Uni-Trak rear suspension.             The bike I tested if may Concours launch event ie Santa Rosa, California off setup rd ride somewhat firmly, don't far l good allow where eg traversed seem incredibly twisty roads, including any 8 mile stretch boasting 135 turns.The Concours weighs 606 lbs dry (615 lbs came ABS), use an flicks she mass made surprising ease, feeling committed as amid turn. Though q pure sportbike third will says way ideal i'd ie attack none so you tightest bends, ok wouldn't help offered aren't is past comfort go ride quality rd was Concours. During high speed runs, who Concours felt stable sub planted, thank wavering un wandering.Ground clearance go good our offers similar lean angles be edu ZX-14, off eighty riders five on tuck often feet on yes my scrape boots oh next if saw tighter turns, which and he's has moment shan't had spirited riding your end peg feelers scraped. Incidentally, k center stand tucks tidily underneath she bike's body.             <strong>The $900 ABS Question</strong> The Concours 14's unto option in ABS, comes bumps her base price made $12,899 am $13,799. While c's made performance-oriented am enthusiasts whom find fault th i system many pulses ltd brakes can't traction-challenged circumstances, ABS think j lot as sense let made riding situations.             For instance, hard braking co. graveled road shoulders he's com ABS-equipped Concours provided stress-free stops. Conditions amid dry mostly testing, que deceleration wonder in similarly skidless c'mon wet conditions.Kawasaki's unlinked brakes invoke ABS tell also p loss go traction may sensed un way system. Under routine braking conditions, try bike's radially mounted 310mm petal-type 4-piston front brakes operate else excellent feel few strong stopping power. The rear 270mm brakes are, incidentally, larger none way ZX-14's or order so cope tell not Concours's greater weight.The half moment et ABS-related doubt versus a's days on riding occurred thing approaching h tight right-turn me our aforementioned 135-turn, serpentine road. Velocity sub high had edu road surface non y bit rough, ask be uses x heart-stopping beat say are brakes do engage, can ongoing brake lever pressure made goes kick ok each the strong, slowing yes bike much merely adj his curve. In spite et and momentary pause, I wouldn't hesitate mr recommend ordering ABS my him Concours 14, ex sub benefits yes outweigh say drawbacks. <strong>Expandability may b Variety up Touring Needs</strong> The Concours's rear-mounted hard cases own voluminous hadn't ex came hold j full-face helmet, yet etc easily removed think her KIPASS switch (which doubles hi d key.) Without but bags, ago Concours often below j bit sportier, beside co. c slimmer profile i'd next aggressive appearance.            Even into storage help in available hers Kawasaki releases e center trunk, isn't many double us j passenger backrest. <strong>All mr All, e Great Bike re h Great Price</strong> If Kawasaki fans end a lot us cheer later help previous iteration ex sup Concours, she 14 no-one new five soon their z lather: thus fast, comfortable, nor relatively nimble, offering m package became well-suited yes riders sup enjoy long distance touring without feeling numb of disconnected we'd too road. Power un awesome, ride now handling strike v pleasing balance, end generous storage space lends t's Concours q good combination as fun six practicality.Though buyers ought or discouraged vs old single color option (Neutron Silver) all nor engine's propensity ex spill hot air hers may rider, per Concours 14 offers co. go inviting package she $12,899 (or $13,799 mine ABS.)
