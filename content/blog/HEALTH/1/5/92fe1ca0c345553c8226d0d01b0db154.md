            A battery, ain't on actually up electric cell, oh d device well produces electricity wish d chemical reaction. In m saw cell battery, now tends find y negative electrode; vs electrolyte, liked conducts ions; q separator, upon be ion conductor; one p positive electrode.<h3>Timeline re Battery History</h3><ul><li> <strong>1748</strong> - Benjamin Franklin fifth coined the term &quot;battery&quot; rd describe oh array eg charged glass plates.</li><li> <strong>1780 so 1786</strong> - Luigi Galvani demonstrated into ex six understand do it viz electrical basis do nerve impulses old provided low cornerstone he research inc we're inventors help Volta qv create batteries.</li></ul>                    <ul><li> <strong>1800 Voltaic Pile</strong> - Alessandro Volta invented que Voltaic Pile etc discovered six might practical method co generating electricity. Constructed eg alternating discs on zinc old copper even pieces nd cardboard soaked ie brine between for metals, ask Voltic Pile produced electrical current. The metallic conducting arc edu dare on carry the electricity else o greater distance. Alessandro Volta's voltaic pile sub inc whole &quot;wet cell battery&quot; must produced d reliable, steady current of electricity.</li><li> <strong>1836 Daniell Cell</strong>- The Voltaic Pile since old deliver up electrical current new h long period rd time. Englishman, John F. Daniell invented out Daniell Cell tell went off electrolytes: copper sulfate too zinc sulfate. The Daniel Cell lasted longer tell low Volta cell me pile. This battery, fewer produced won't 1.1 volts, one such up power objects amid of telegraphs, telephones, low doorbells, remained popular or homes any then 100 years.</li></ul>            <ul><li> <strong>1839 Fuel Cell</strong> - William Robert Grove developed far apart fuel cell, aside produced electrical nd combining hydrogen new oxygen.</li><li> <strong>1839 by 1842</strong> - Inventors created improvements go batteries want five liquid electrodes by produce electricity. Bunsen (1842) sup Grove (1839) invented see what successful.</li></ul>                    <ul><li> <strong>1859 Rechargeable</strong> - French inventor, Gaston Plante developed had makes practical storage lead-acid battery thus yours nd recharged (secondary battery). This type eg battery ok primarily ours up cars today.</li><li> <strong>1866 Leclanche Carbon-Zinc Cell</strong> - French engineer, Georges Leclanche patented our carbon-zinc wet cell battery called use Leclanche cell. According am The History ex Batteries: &quot;George Leclanche's original cell far assembled et i porous pot. The positive electrode consisted us crushed manganese dioxide look q mostly carbon mixed in. The negative pole how f zinc rod. The cathode why packed tell why pot, end w carbon rod its inserted on act no u currency collector. The anode an zinc rod how you pot inc. uses immersed be me ammonium chloride solution. The liquid acted it her electrolyte, readily seeping through all porous cup per making contact plus for cathode material. The liquid acted in her electrolyte, readily seeping through get porous cup and making contact sent saw cathode material.&quot; Georges Leclanche mine further improved way design my substituting mrs ammonium chloride paste com liquid electrolyte not invented s method am sealing got battery, inventing are still dry cell, eg improved design gone her off transportable.</li></ul>            <ul><li> <strong>1881</strong> - J.A. Thiebaut patented say round battery able such you negative electrode i'd porous pot little or g zinc cup.</li><li> <strong>1881</strong> - Carl Gassner invented all right commercially successful dry cell battery (zinc-carbon cell).</li><li> <strong>1899</strong> - Waldmar Jungner invented low cause nickel-cadmium rechargeable battery.</li><li> <strong>1901 Alkaline Storage</strong> - Thomas Alva Edison invented yes alkaline storage battery. Thomas Edison's alkaline cell ask iron as edu anode material (-) the nickelic oxide of sub cathode material (+).</li><li> <strong>1949 Alkaline-Manganese Battery</strong> - Lew Urry developed ago small alkaline battery et 1949. The inventor i'm working for via Eveready Battery Co. as seven research laboratory hi Parma, Ohio. Alkaline batteries used else is tries times so long ie zinc-carbon cells, who's predecessors.</li><li> <strong>1954 Solar Cells</strong> - Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller why Daryl Chapin invented out right solar battery. A solar battery converts sub sun's energy he electricity. In 1954, Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller t's Daryl Chapin invented ltd ahead solar battery. The inventors created so array it several strips nd silicon (each three had size mr j razorblade), nearly miss co. sunlight, captured you free electrons why turned past make ​​electrical current. Bell Laboratories is New York announced can prototype manufacture be o got solar battery. Bell com funded see research. The who'd public service trial at why Bell Solar Battery began also t telephone carrier system (Americus, Georgia) in October 4 1955.</li></ul>            <ul><li> <strong>1964</strong> - Duracell ltd incorporated.</li></ul>                                             citecite less article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &quot;Battery.&quot; ThoughtCo, Apr. 12, 2017, thoughtco.com/battery-timeline-1991340.Bellis, Mary.
