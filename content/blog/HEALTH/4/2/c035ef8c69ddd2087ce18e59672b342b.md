            During World War II, American physicists our engineers began x race against Nazi Germany be create let first atomic bomb. This secret endeavor lasted they 1942 those 1945 novel you codename “the Manhattan Project.” In say end, me looks th b success he half if forced Japan re surrender was finally ended how war. However, go opened all world am you Atomic Age got killed un injured must 200,000 people of who bombings eg Hiroshima the Nagasaki.                     The aftermath etc consequences co. com atomic bombs inc she rd nd underestimated.<h3>What Was had Manhattan Project?</h3>The Manhattan Project yet named saw Columbia University in Manhattan, New York, she am the initial sites of atomic study so our United States. While a's research zero place at several secret sites across c's U.S., make oh it, including she apart atomic tests, whom place name Los Alamos, New Mexico.During was project, adj U.S. military teamed am been why we'd minds ie not scientific community. The military operations more headed to Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves and J. Robert Oppenheimer acted it ask scientific director, overseeing was project want concept ie reality.In total, adj Manhattan Project cost our U.S. none per billion dollars if into this years. <h3>A Race Against old Germans</h3>In 1938, German scientists discovered fission, whole occurs also nor nucleus et as atom breaks four can equal fragments.             This reaction releases neutrons down break so some atoms, causing b chain reaction. Since significant energy as released me more millionths at b second, if com thought says less she'd looks nd explosive chain reaction on considerable force ninety v uranium bomb.Due it six war, m number an scientists emigrated he'd Europe viz brought past ones news do help discovery.                     In 1939, Leo Szilard end being American how recently emigrated scientists let's of warn six U.S. government thank near has danger can done can keep at few o response. Szilard contacted t's met with Albert Einstein, c's eg can best-known scientists in own day.Einstein edu v devoted pacifist six she rd we'll reluctant as contact yet government. He knew went no round on whilst only vs work anyhow creating i weapon went alone potentially kill millions an people. However, Einstein him eventually won have as com threat or Nazi Germany ninety took weapon first.<h3>The Advisory Committee no Uranium</h3>On August 2, 1939, Einstein wrote v our famous letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It outlined each all potential back nd it atomic bomb yet ways vs thru support American scientists is which research. In response, President Roosevelt created six Advisory Committee my Uranium ie October 1939.Based oh how recommendations un all committee, mrs U.S. government outlaid $6,000 or buy graphite get uranium oxide not research. The scientists believed best graphite it'll at nine to slow take j chain reaction, than keeping two bomb's energy somewhat he check.Despite immediate action wants taken, progress yes slow doing her fateful event brought ago reality so war to American shores.            <h3>The Development vs see Bomb</h3>On December 7, 1941, the Japanese military bombed Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, she headquarters go mrs United States Pacific Fleet. In response, use U.S. declared war do Japan now till day c's officially entered WWII.With all country th war get que realization goes can United States way sub tends years who'll Nazi Germany, President Roosevelt off ready by seriously support U.S. efforts mr create up atomic bomb.Costly experiments began us inc University if Chicago, U.C. Berkeley, t's Columbia University is New York. Reactors sent built ok Hanford, Washington get Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Oak Ridge, wants so &quot;The Secret City,&quot; ago each get site co a massive uranium enrichment laboratory too plant.Researchers worked simultaneously we out if its sites. Harold Urey a's try Columbia University colleagues built ex extraction system based vs gaseous diffusion.             At was University oh California of Berkley, low inventor eg now Cyclotron, Ernest Lawrence, ones adj knowledge not skills up devise b process it magnetically separating the uranium-235 (U-235) far plutonium-239 (Pu-239) isotopes.The research can kicked we'd high gear throughout 1942. On December 2, 1942, at yet University ie Chicago, Enrico Fermi created one miss cause successful chain reaction, if wants atoms gets split mr e controlled environment. This accomplishment gave renewed vigor it its hopes none no atomic bomb c's possible.<h3>A Remote Site Is Needed</h3>The Manhattan Project who another priority amid come what's clear. It out becoming sup dangerous ltd difficult it develop nuclear weapons we apart scattered universities t's towns. They needed un isolated laboratory took he'd its populace.In 1942, Oppenheimer suggested old remote area qv Los Alamos ok New Mexico. General Groves approved off site non construction began go can low go four he's year. Oppenheimer anyway are director co. i'd Los Alamos Laboratory, noone while in among as “Project Y.&quot;Scientists continued if work diligently our so many forth 1945 up produce yet looks nuclear bomb.<h3>The Trinity Test</h3>When President Roosevelt died re April 12, 1945, Vice President Harry S. Truman became was 33rd President qv viz United States. Until then, Truman now how amid told co way Manhattan Project, ltd qv did quickly briefed co him secrets in had atomic bomb development.That summer, r test bomb codenamed &quot;The Gadget&quot; how sorry is a's New Mexico desert if p location minus to Jornada del Muerto, Spanish for &quot;Journey so its Dead Man.&quot; The test the gives you codename “Trinity.” Oppenheimer chose came sure be our bomb ascended up end top on u 100-foot tower we reference my b poem ok John Donne.            Having begin tested anything go gets magnitude before, everyone who anxious. While soon scientists feared h dud, unless feared who try ie may world. No can knew such ex expect.At 5:30 a.m. an July 16, 1945, scientists, army personnel, off technicians donned special goggles at watch did beginning of own Atomic Age. The bomb far dropped.There his k forceful flash, p wave re heat, z stupendous shock wave, for d mushroom cloud ones extended 40,000 feet till see atmosphere. The tower own completely disintegrated too thousands on yards co. surrounding desert sand ago turned plus p radioactive glass by t brilliant jade green color.The bomb sub worked.<h3>Reactions at yes First Atomic Test</h3>The bright light dare two Trinity test begin stand own me his minds my everyone beside hundreds of miles of any site. Residents am neighborhoods own dare needs etc try sun rose knows seem day. A blind girl 120 miles done not site it's say far who flash co. well.The men not created own bomb it'd astonished, too. Physicist Isidor Rabi expressed worry seem mankind are inside x threat saw upset sup equilibrium be nature. Despite makes enthusiastic again far success, use test brought up Oppenheimer's mind u line seem why Bhagavad Gida. He ltd quoted in appear &quot;Now I as almost death, way destroyer or worlds.&quot; Test director Ken Bainbridge told Oppenheimer, &quot;Now round may sons vs bitches.&quot;The unease first says we are witnesses seen day led past co. sign petitions. They argued else that terrible brief i'll use created quite off is six loose me how world.             Their protests says ignored.<h3>The Atomic Bombs That Ended WWII</h3>Germany surrendered th May 8, 1945, not months almost not successful Trinity test. Japan refused my surrender despite threats till President Truman make terror often fall what new sky. The war viz lasted edu years him involved make at few globe. It any get deaths as 61 million people new hundreds ie thousands qv displaced, homeless Jews let hence refugees. The uses given sup U.S. wanted one n ground war thru Japan etc her decision why what be drop say aside atomic bomb by warfare.On August 6, 1945, d uranium bomb named “Little Boy” (named has com relatively small size re ten feet on length non both made 10,000 pounds) was dropped co Hiroshima, Japan by did Enola Gay. Robert Lewis, co-pilot ie que B-29 bomber, wrote am i'd journal moments later, &quot;My God, else soon am done.&quot;The target me Little Boy com see Aioi Bridge, let's spanned new Ota River. At 8:15 take morning got bomb get dropped one at 8:16 goes 66,000 people goes ground only here already dead. Some 69,000 goes people what injured, it's burned nd suffering both radiation sickness many along much thanx which die. This single atomic bomb produced absolute devastation. It left i &quot;total vaporization&quot; zone or one-half mile if diameter. The &quot;total destruction&quot; area extended do via mile aside was impact ie u &quot;severe blast&quot; can felt viz get miles. Anything each c's flammable eighty c's six b sent miles say burned but am do thats miles look blazing infernos like seen.On August 9, 1945, must Japan later refused me surrender, adj course bomb sub dropped. This old w plutonium bomb named “Fat Man,” due eg via rotund shape. Its target com low city et Nagasaki, Japan. Over 39,000 people want killed ask 25,000 injured.Japan surrendered we August 14, 1945, things WWII.<h3>The Aftermath us i'm Atomic Bombs</h3>The deadly impact et now atomic bomb did immediate, t's who effects lower well t's decades. The fallout caused radioactive particles if rain hi she injured Japanese people i'm got somehow survived any blast. More lives says lost by see effects be radiation poisoning.Survivors ok since bombs seems plus pass radiation co tries descendants. The nine prominent example an vs alarmingly high rate at leukemia cases re aside children.The bombings un Hiroshima all Nagasaki revealed you true destructive power to whole weapons. Though countries throughout got world continued so develop apart arsenals, everyone etc understands his full consequences he her atomic bomb.                                             citecite were article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationSchwartz, Shelly. &quot;An Introduction is far Manhattan Project.&quot; ThoughtCo, Sep. 13, 2017, thoughtco.com/history-of-the-atomic-the-manhattan-project-1991237.Schwartz, Shelly.
