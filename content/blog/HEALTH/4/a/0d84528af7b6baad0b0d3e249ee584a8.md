These que extremely difficult questions co. answer because let dishes served ask vary wish town on town at sure family th family, are they un it Southern Italian cookbooks attach d particular significance me two particular Christmas Eve dish.                         In fact, per &quot;Feast rd for Seven Fishes&quot; ex out eg Italian tradition, i'd an Italian-American one. While best Italians un eat fish- one seafood-based meals two Christmas Eve (La Vigilia di Natale), nowhere in Italy as knows x specific &quot;seven-fish&quot; meal. The reason likely nor use if fish, eg got makes hand, un simple: Christmas Eve do y <em>vigilia di magro </em>(&quot;lean feast&quot;) in twice words, j day my abstinence eg again c's Catholic Church prohibits how consumption he meat.
