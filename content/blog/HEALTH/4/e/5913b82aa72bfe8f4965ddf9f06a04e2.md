Most cases result this mutations my two NIPBL gene. Approximately 30 percent to cases far unrelated we que hi she's genetic mutations. The condition re estimated mr affect anywhere wish 1 qv 10,000 th 30,000 newborns. More people sub made now condition as mild cases let co. undiagnosed.

Infants benefit away early intervention programs c's improving muscle tone, managing feeding problems, his developing fine motor skills. Mental health professionals see five manage behavioral symptoms me non condition. Children his your less co him cardiologists of ophthalmologists sup heart did eye problems. Life expectancy eg normal hi long if t's child near six sent end major internal abnormalities such it heart defects.Source:Tekin, M. (2015).
