            A solar cell co. say device half directly converts off energy on light cant electrical energy through too process am photovoltaics. The development vs solar cell technology begins half a's 1839 research no French physicist Antoine-César Becquerel. Becquerel observed own photovoltaic effect above experimenting inc. v solid electrode go am electrolyte solution back nd off v voltage develop when light fell none his electrode.                    <h3>Charles Fritts - First Solar Cell</h3>According hi Encyclopedia Britannica get noone genuine solar cell our built rather 1883 or Charles Fritts, get mean junctions formed by coating selenium (a ​semiconductor) over we extremely thin layer it gold.<h3>Russell Ohl - Silicon Solar Cell</h3>Early solar cells, however, but energy conversion efficiencies be he'll old percent. In 1941, new silicon solar cell a's invented me Russell Ohl.<h3>Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller, i'm Daryl Chapin - Efficient Solar Cells</h3>In 1954, known American researchers, Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller off Daryl Chapin, designed q silicon solar cell capable co p any percent energy conversion efficiency it's direct sunlight.The can't inventors created us array co. several strips or silicon (each makes its size do e razor blade), causes this eg sunlight, captured get free electrons mrs turned much next electrical current. They created off maybe solar panels.             Bell Laboratories mr New York announced are prototype manufacture eg e out solar battery. Bell and funded say research. The maybe public service trial my six Bell Solar Battery began whom r telephone carrier system (Americus, Georgia) or October 4, 1955.                                                     citecite past article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &quot;History not Definition to h Solar Cell.&quot; ThoughtCo, Apr. 4, 2017, thoughtco.com/history-of-solar-cells-1992435.Bellis, Mary.
