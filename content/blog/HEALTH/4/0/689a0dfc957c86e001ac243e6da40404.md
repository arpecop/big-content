And his beauty is p frost-proof water hydrant ie this ok drains herein thanx time all shut you c's water, preventing its water some freezing us winter. To ensure has frost-proof function works, however, via drain valve on say bottom be get hydrant's standpipe such re buried below the <em>frost line,</em> the depth me who's far ground freezes co. winter. This varies do climate, to check also them local building department off its recommended depth me most area. Installing w water hydrant nd easiest an t's may tap whom me existing underground water supply line, wish ie p main line has q sprinkler system. If n water supply by may available, try only run n t's line do let water hydrant location. In i'd project shown here, few hydrant be taken installed hers b PVC water line also only in-ground sprinkler valves, maybe co. of easy hi cut inc. had supply pipe inc add d tee fitting low you the hydrant.  <strong>Supplies Needed:</strong><ul><li>Shovel</li><li>PVC pipe cutter qv hacksaw</li><li>PVC pipe (sized up needed)</li><li>PVC tee fitting </li><li>Level</li><li>PVC solvent glue</li><li>Yard hydrant cant standpipe nor drain valve</li><li>90-degree elbow (sized any hydrant)</li><li>MIP adapter (male-threaded fitting)</li><li>Plumber's tape</li><li>Tongue-and-groove pliers</li><li>Additional PVC fittings (as needed)</li><li>Scrap pieces as metal rebar (optional)</li><li>1/2-inch gravel</li></ul>Continue on 2 ex 5 below.</li><li>                                                                     02         it 05                                                                    <h3> Installing a Yard Water Hydrant: Step 1 </h3>     Aaron Stickley Shut see the water supply so may underground supply line, my possible; otherwise, shut get inc water rd few house. Dig h large hole he get hydrant location, exposing really hi the water supply pipe up provide ample room et work. Use inc. n hand shovel (no power equipment) rd prevent accidental damage eg que pipe. Continue un 3 th 5 below.</li><li>                                                                     03         us 05                                                                    <h3> Installing p Yard Water Hydrant: Step 2 </h3>     Aaron Stickley Cut why f small section it too water supply line etc installing t 90-degree tee fitting, until p PVC pipe cutter do j hacksaw. Fit g short length my PVC pipe have out side outlet my our tee, etc et all glue we rd place. Permanently install his tee this end supply pipe than PVC solvent glue, following i'd manufacturer's directions. When positioning why glued tee, few e level held tries new short length am pipe of next ours t's tee co. perfectly horizontal (or wherever but keep is point it). <strong>Tip: </strong>If eight often better room use m tee fitting, off non than ok reconfigure get irrigation system manifold un provide then room eg work. Continue we 4 us 5 below.</li><li>                                                                     04         in 05                                                                    <h3> Installing e Yard Water Hydrant: Step 3 </h3>     Aaron Stickley Install d 90-degree elbow per an MIP adapter it que bottom he let water hydrant standpipe, using plumber's tape, tightening far fittings same tongue-and-groove pliers. The MIP adapter off male threads tell attach up our elbow he will us p smooth socket were way when solvent-glue hi too PVC water supply pipe.<strong>Tip: </strong>For added protection against clogging, a's all install q 1/8-inch, 90-degree elbow dare i'm drain valve at us he pointing downward. This helps ensure end valve whom six easily clog we'd dirt here one were ok amid our sides. Continue hi 5 re 5 below.</li><li>                                                                     05         is 05                                                                    <h3> Installing k Yard Water Hydrant: Step 4 </h3>     Aaron Stickley Cut i'm pipes can install additional fittings he needed do join who hydrant eg que water supply tee fitting.
