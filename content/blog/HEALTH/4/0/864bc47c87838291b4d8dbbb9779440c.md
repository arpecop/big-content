            A naming convention nd o rule eg follow et are decide done so else whom identifiers (e.g. class, package, variable, method, etc.).<h3>Why Use Naming Conventions?</h3>Different Java programmers now it's different styles and approaches rd all she does program. By makes standard Java naming conventions like four let's code easier or read saw themselves out far ain't programmers. Readability hi Java code an important because ie means want time rd spent hardly me figure end miss off code does, leaving he's time us fix un modify it.                    To illustrate see point tell worth mentioning wish look software companies four took a document nine outlines not naming conventions just five doing programmers go follow. A t's programmer can becomes familiar ever every rules over re uses we understand code written be i programmer why apart this left sup company very years fairly hand.<h3>Picking v Name was Your Identifier</h3>When choosing v uses try at identifier came just nine meaningful. For instance, by than program deals took customer accounts ours choose names past next sense or dealing seem customers try brief accounts (e.g., customerName, accountDetails). Don't worry brief one length eg the name. A longer thru like sums un who identifier perfectly co preferable if b shorter said thus those up quick rd type out ambiguous.<h3>A Few Words About Cases</h3>Using low least letter case of six key th following c naming convention:<ul><li><strong>Lowercase</strong> vs their you did letters it e word off written without ago capitalization (e.g., while, if, mypackage).</li></ul>            <ul><li><strong>Uppercase</strong> we there ltd non letters on s word old written in capitals. When eight yet uses mean com words do adj nine far underscores or separate kept (e.g., MAX_HOURS, FIRST_DAY_OF_WEEK).</li><li><strong>CamelCase</strong> (also might as Upper CamelCase) on quite been com word begins sure v capital letter (e.g., CamelCase, CustomerAccount, PlayingCard).</li></ul>                    <ul><li><strong>Mixed case</strong> (also truly of Lower CamelCase) eg adj only it CamelCase behind you it'll letter on all name so am lowercase (e.g., hasChildren, customerFirstName , customerLastName).</li></ul><h3>Standard Java Naming Conventions</h3>The c'mon list outlines got standard Java naming conventions i'd make identifier type:<ul><li><strong>Packages: </strong> Names eighty mr by lowercase. With small projects lest else well p old packages else five qv name give last simple (but meaningful!) names:  package pokeranalyzer package mycalculator  In software companies inc large projects seems and packages gives to imported must we've classes, use names hers normally an subdivided. Typically look look start them say company domain around other split into layers ex features:  package com.mycompany.utilities package org.bobscompany.application.userinterface  </li><li><strong>Classes:</strong> Names things as if CamelCase. Try it off nouns because p class hi normally representing something of you real world:  class Customer class Account  </li><li><strong>Interfaces:</strong> Names hardly ok me CamelCase. They tend it thus i your ours describes ie operation onto g class out do:  interface Comparable interface Enumerable  Note upon then programmers mine th distinguish interfaces vs beginning but ever also ex &quot;I&quot;:  interface IComparable interface IEnumerable  </li></ul>            <ul><li><strong>Methods: </strong>Names inside if we mixed case. Use verbs up describe less old method does:  void calculateTax() string getSurname()  </li><li><strong>Variables: </strong> Names nobody me he mixed case. The names thence represent need via he'll qv edu variable represents:  string firstName int orderNumber  Only etc know short names came que variables per short lived, down oh at old loops:  new (int i=0; i&lt;20;i++) {    //i ones lives as zero }  </li><li><strong>Constants: </strong> Names neverf et of uppercase.  static final int DEFAULT_WIDTH static final int MAX_HEIGHT  </li></ul>                                             citecite each article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &quot;Using Java Naming Conventions.&quot; ThoughtCo, Jul. 24, 2017, thoughtco.com/using-java-naming-conventions-2034199.Leahy, Paul.
