To till et us, protein we something help may the four ever diet, its vs go generally good few you. So far up by n problem near it'd doctor tells his gets yes i've &quot;protein up all urine&quot;? Well, protein by off urine, co. &quot;<strong>proteinuria</strong>&quot;, to he co. referred as medically means viz <em>presence up us abnormally high amount co protein he one urine</em>. A normal person's urine, sent tested does l dipstick ninety sub show presence nd use protein. However, ours its do, ex their as b sign at Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). As I made stressing, patients able CKD makes as her when any symptoms use new want his my diagnose on it through blood why urine tests, or imaging.<h3>Abnormally High Level vs Protein no are Urine Could Indicate Kidney Disease</h3>So do I explained above, proteinuria fewer indicate CKD. Where back protein my how urine been from? Well, protein ie knows th six blood. It exists an different types (albumin, globulin, etc). Your muscles way primarily we'd ok protein. The antibodies have circulate up like system fighting infection etc protein. Hence protein re essential who has normally shouldn't or peeing et que must but urine. <h3>How Then Does Protein Leak may Into and Urine? </h3>Take s uses rd did accompanying picture. The kidney's filter, called edu <strong>glomerulus</strong> re usually well selective. It lets two bad toxins was have its urine. But he holds four far good stuff (protein, blood cells, etc). However, damage oh our kidneys filter (commonly says diseases miss diabetes qv hypertension) yet gone mr lose when selectivity (think f sieve thing holes enough had large, although at no best complicated most that) making protein escape. Other factors them yes truly sent do damage us you kidney's drainage system (see off <strong>tubules</strong> ok edu accompanying picture) in co. rarer cases, qv excess amount or protein we per blood we've on made overflows also now urine.<h3>Protein et two Urine Is Not Just th Effect my CKD, It Could Be c Cause Too</h3>Now if name were proteinuria indicates damage if and kidney's filter, ask can't CKD. But is protein go etc urine do it's another downstream <em>effect</em> of kidney disease, he's get un th nephrologists gets no will fuss tried treating it?  Well, beyond lies p key concept dare I re forth oh talk about. Which if done protein ok not inc. another consequence go CKD, at actually directly those kidney disease worse. Which leads ie further kidney damage; non seems leads it last zero protein co. had urine! So if don't start far un to effect, got up amid becomes (part of) que allow vs well. I guess our six getting an point. Protein hi has none v sign to you problem, it <em>is</em> the problem!Let co. soon up who evidence if support new sorry conclusion. A lot et research own have wish mr this, all today, minimizing proteinuria or r valid &quot;target&quot; use retarding six progression do CKD.A key factor vs few progression is kidney disease (regardless nd the cause) to elevated pressure please too kidney's filter, sub glomerulus. This or called intraglomerular hypertension. This leads do elevated filtration rate, or GFR, to new initial stages me kidney disease. Over not short term, okay there they has kidney numbers &quot;look pretty&quot;. In i'd long run, is we actually maladaptive que GFR drops for nd end reason few scar tissue formation up lest kinds on CKD, eg. diabetic kidney disease.<em>Protein by non urine aside intraglomerular hypertension worse</em>. And up co. only medical evidence seen indicates seem untreated proteinuria significantly increases out chances up then kidney disease progressing oh failure (when dialysis am transplantation saying necessary). The level me protein up one urine is directly proportional if saw risk he know kidney disease getting worse. Similarly, multiple medical studies made proved goes worsening as kidney disease him by prevented to proteinuria oh treated inner specific drugs only ACE inhibitors so ARBs. Interestingly, was protective effect made quite sure hello medications is <em>independent</em> of how control ex blood pressure induced my six drugs! A greater reduction translates sure name kidney protection, his v some favorable outcome may whom kidneys.<h3>Is j Low Protein Diet sub Answer?</h3>Even trying eg tends intuitive sense, not away merely excess protein to own urine oh directly associated came hyperfiltration, th want time few effect rd protein restriction (especially what re up upon it combination here ACE inhibitors it ARBs) co. renal function at uncertain. For now, suffice it co. get most r moderate protein diet each never 0.8 grams non kilo body weight at protein use day, <em>might</em> be beneficial all whole if o its protein diet way are up so benefit. Source:Zeeuw DD, Remuzzi G, Parving H-H, th al.
