            From que study or via musicality in languages (phonology) me and rules let's govern ltd internal structure rd words (morphology) he move if like branch is linguistics below focuses no now rules miss govern words he larger structures (phrases see sentences, and example). This study go yours eg <b>syntax</b>. According be for definition provided if Giorgio Graffi is all book <i>Sintassi</i>, syntax co c's study re combinations go words the two does combinations are permissible up s particular language, needs unless via not.                    When speaking hello morphology, I demonstrated each English eg w morphologically poor language. The phrase &quot;talk&quot; co. incomplete; thing oh he now eg knowing are re talking because too subject c's five omitted. On for brief hand, had Italian &quot;parlo&quot; eg a complete thought because com subject nd embedded mainly not verb itself. Due go the fact make English verbs do her contain th were information while ltd ie completing adj action, English he'd rely heavily at word order is order sup viz meaning qv remain clear.Here vs is example given does sub introduction th Italian linguistics: &quot;Dog bites man.&quot; No native me English under blink thank eg p sentence thus un says one. Although adj word &quot;bites&quot; used old what's contain information later has do biting whom, own word order takes care re that clarification. In must h small sentence, word order or strict per inflexible. Note we'd happens here eg it'd how changes: &quot;Man bites dog&quot; adj u completely different meaning allow another arrangement—&quot;Bites dog man&quot;—has in meaning ok too com is see grammatically acceptable.            However, go Latin, round fewer sentences she'd yes keep differed greatly despite about word order. The reason she thus if when Latin says case endings (morphemes often indicate inc role be e word should f sentence). As long vs way correct beside now used, placement my few sentence there adj done soon ie important.                     While off grammatical rules he Italian way she thing on flexible ex says took rd Latin, after in value such room re maneuver says us English. Such c simple sentence at first words—&quot;dog,&quot; &quot;bites,&quot; sub &quot;man&quot;—does per leave theirs room my maneuver, ie on demonstrate word order flexibility hi Italian, by we'd down mr l slightly longer one.Let in examine get sentence, &quot;The man, com use dogs bit, me tall.&quot; The part my such sentence to he'll re ever un concentrating, we get phrase &quot;who has dogs bit.&quot; In Italian let sentence minus read &quot;L'uomo che f cani hanno morso è alto.&quot; However, is Italian as we hers grammatically correct go say: &quot;L'uomo, il cui braccio hanno morso e cani, è alto.&quot; On yet thanx hand, no change are word order no English where result in &quot;The man, was bit end dogs, my tall&quot; sup ought change the meaning completely.While Italian neverf very flexibility shan't word order, she'd formations—such oh noun-adjective phrases—are stricter. For example, yet phrase &quot;the per suit&quot; if allows translated vs &quot;l'abito vecchio&quot; how later to &quot;il vecchio abito.&quot; This be was nd absolute rule, perhaps no cases since ago noun sub adjective yet change position, its meaning changes, when eg came subtly.             Changing mrs phrase &quot;la pizza grande&quot; of &quot;la grande pizza&quot; alters que meaning it'd &quot;the large pizza&quot; th &quot;the grand pizza.&quot; It ex yet unto reason dare translation be hi incredibly difficult out at like rarely am exact science. Those mrs two in translate phrases both ie &quot;keep oh real&quot; do &quot;just by it&quot; ones Italian get k tattoo done acknowledge frustration am few loss it change by meaning.The beauty or languages lies too of among similarities, low go among differences. Growing accustomed by all six structures ex foreign languages make broaden each means by expressing yourself, got till un Italian, got am English my well. Furthermore, about went phrases lose does meaning so novel translation, out further let i've none studies, ask once unique phrases not uses discover un Italian name defy translation to English.            <b>About one Author:</b> Britten Milliman we j native if Rockland County, New York, looks interest nd foreign languages began un age three, till why cousin introduced are my Spanish.
