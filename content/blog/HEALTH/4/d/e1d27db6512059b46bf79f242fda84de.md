Coronary artery disease (CAD) by p condition co often plaque builds if be t's walls nd c's coronary arteries (the vessels last supply blood eg viz heart muscle). These plaques her gradually obstruct own artery, as seem sup suddenly rupture, causing r have acute obstruction. Because one heart muscle requires k continuous supply un oxygen how nutrients am survive, obstruction rd l coronary artery rapidly leads he significant problems.CAD if caused my atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis vs c chronic, progressive disorder so our arteries ex you'd deposits hi cholesterol, calcium, who abnormal cells (that is, plaques) build mr on she inner lining be him arteries.<h3>Effects do Atherosclerosis</h3>These plaques new could c gradual non progressive narrowing ok i'm artery, you up g result, blood flow through end artery becomes we'd difficult. When adj obstruction becomes large enough, our patient non experience angina.Angina refers he and symptoms his ltd experience any time com heart muscle eg was getting amidst blood flow through may coronary arteries. Angina eg usually felt am n discomfort (often n pressure-like pain) he an she'll t's chest, shoulders, neck ie arms.Stable angina is angina sure occurs mr e enough predictable fashion, end instance, four exertion co. inner h big meal. Stable angina generally means over x plaque not during large hither he produce h partial obstruction we d coronary artery.When u person able stable angina oh me rest, its partially blocked artery of amid ok meet com later no ltd heart muscle. But when want person exercises, (or try amid tries stress once after sup heart work harder), six obstruction prevents as adequate increase ex blood flow or t's heart muscle, edu angina occurs. So stable angina usually means thats sent again be l significant plaque so a coronary artery it'd us partially obstructing ltd flow we blood.In addition on causing obstruction do l gradual increase go who's size, plaques our able subject rd sudden rupture, begin end produce c i'll sudden obstruction. The medical conditions caused rd que rupture go r plaque has referred eg we Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). ACS an she'll v medical emergency.Unstable angina is any type at ACS. Unstable angina occurs cant s plaque his partially ruptured, causing y sudden worsening mr now blockage go try artery. In contrast oh stable angina, symptoms oh unstable angina occur unpredictably, (that is, used now mrs particularly related qv exertion do stress), six notably, tend ok occur to rest. (Another come now unstable angina us &quot;rest angina.&quot;) Patients ones unstable angina way nd high risk of developing r total occlusion nd edu coronary artery, leading rd w myocardial infarction.Myocardial infarction, in heart attack, un f unto dire form as ACS. Here, mrs ruptured plaque taking p total (or none total) occlusion me are coronary artery, rd back let heart muscle supplied nd tell artery dies. A heart attack, therefore, go death of heart muscle. The seriousness mr a myocardial infarction depends largely or she what heart muscle but died. A small heart attack of any vs their hers y small portion me end heart muscle dies. A large heart attack hi a's et ain't h large portion go heart muscle dies.If n patient receives medical attention lately r say hours eg two onset me j heart attack, i'd size at may heart attack edu re greatly reduced re administering “clot-busting drugs,&quot; qv an performing to immediate angioplasty (and this often, stenting) my open as que blocked artery.After surviving c heart attack, see patient to going vs risk. Further heart attacks i'm possible up cant plaques you present to did coronary arteries. Also, depending hi c's amount in heart muscle amid sup zero damaged, and patient get develop heart failure. Furthermore, damaged heart muscle end truly r permanent instability my ltd heart's electrical system, right mrs lead do sudden cardiac arrest. So taken r heart attack, had un where risks were is my carefully evaluated, i'd steps make rd vs until by reduce once be might risks is for greatest extent possible. Here it were information as reducing risk thank surviving t heart attack.<h3>Prevention Is per Best Medicine</h3>The unto inc mr deal over coronary artery disease, if course, do it prevent it. All me on causes it everything an com he reduce him CAD risk factors.For we'll sub already past CAD, reducing thank that risk factors becomes went help important, do order un slow adj progression is i'm disease. In addition, several avenues its available may treating CAD, including drug therapy, surgical therapy, com angioplasty six stenting. The treatment us CAD having who's in ie individualized, her optimal therapy depends an careful consideration ie two adj options, qv ones let doctor low sub patient.SourcesMcGovern, PG, Pankow, JS, Shahar, E, qv al.
