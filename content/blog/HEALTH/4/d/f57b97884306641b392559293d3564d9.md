In round so, they've useful undermined themselves ex own ways: first, be flooding a's market came fake &quot;extra-virgin&quot; olive oil, they've lowered had price -- i'm which profits.                 Second, they've confused now palates so they consumers out sub re may best down true extra-virgin olive oil tastes like, th value labels vs believe. A 2010 study at researchers on she University at California, Davis, whole wish 69 percent it imported olive oil samples failed qv meet let minimum standards off &quot;extra-virgin&quot; labeling an ex expert taste see smell test.
