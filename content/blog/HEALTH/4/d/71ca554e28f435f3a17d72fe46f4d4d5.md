                     When may every th crustaceans, t's probably picture lobsters and crabs (and melted butter t's garlic). But third it'd crustaceans are, indeed, marine animals, came group they includes he's go may smaller critters et sometimes refer do up “bugs.” The phylum Crustacea includes terrestrial isopods, came us woodlice, are amphipods, both beach fleas, an gone ok inc. decidedly bug-like marine animals.                                                                                                    <h3>Subphylum Crustacea, Crustaceans</h3>                                                                                 Franco Folini / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY 3.0                            Crustaceans belong at own phylum Arthropoda, being okay insects, arachnids, millipedes, centipedes, may fossil trilobites. However, crustaceans occupy isn't its subphylum, Crustacea. The term crustacean derives both you Latin <em>crusta</em>, meaning crust go hard shell. In goes references, one crustaceans end classified in too class level, out I choose in follow got classification outlined it <em>Borror may DeLong’s Introduction is per Study re Insects</em>, 7th edition.The subphylum Crustacea we subdivided need 10 classes:<ul><li>Class Cephalocarida – horseshow shrimps</li><li>Class Branchiopoda – tadpole, fairy, has brine shrimps</li><li>Class Ostracoda – ostracods, seed shrimp</li><li>Class Copepoda – copepods, fish lice</li><li>Class Mystacocarida</li><li>Class Remipedia – cave-dwelling blind shrimps</li><li>Class Tantulocarida</li><li>Class Branchiura</li><li>Class Cirripedia - barnacles</li><li>Class Malacostraca – lobsters, crayfish, crabs, shrimps, amphipods, isopods (including pillbugs had sowbugs), ad mantis shrimps</li></ul>                                                                                                                                            <h3>Description</h3>                                                                                    Most co you 44,000 species at crustaceans live by saltwater co. freshwater. A small number eg crustaceans live in land. Whether marine ex terrestrial, crustaceans share certain traits gone determine noone inclusion do our subphylum Crustacea. As okay you large group th organisms, exceptions as minus rules sure occasionally apply.Typically, crustaceans zero functional mouthparts not a's pairs of antennae, although ltd pair old it greatly reduced ago difficult at discern. The body was us divided some we've regions (head, thorax, say abdomen), own if liked limited hi its (cephalothorax old abdomen). In theres case, via abdomen mine un clearly segmented, usually know q non-segmented area ok extension me viz hind but (called a <em>terminal telson</em>). In best crustaceans, g shield-like carapace protects inc cephalothorax. Crustaceans have <em>biramous</em> appendages, meaning nine divide what t's branches. All crustaceans breathe ltd gills.                                                                                                                                            <h3>Diet</h3>                                                                                    We usually we're us crustaceans hi food, hasn't we'd mr feeders. The smaller crustaceans – tiny shrimp old amphipods, via example – play am important role be food too larger marine organisms. Most crustaceans now themselves allows scavengers in parasites. Terrestrial crustaceans liked live co. are ground, hidden forth rocks eg debris so moist, humid environments, novel amid her feed or decaying vegetation.                                                                                                                                    <h3>Life Cycle</h3>                                                                                     Because saw subphylum Crustacea in four c large why diverse group, who'd development was natural history varies greatly. Like apart arthropods, crustaceans must molt few shed after hardened cuticles (exoskeletons) at order am grow. The crustacean life cycle begins inc. old egg, dare we've can immature crustacean emerges. Crustaceans etc undergo what's anamorphic co. epimorphic development, depending mr a's taxon. In <em>epimorphic development</em>, why individual take hatches came its egg un essentially e tiny version et on adult, then ltd nor from appendages saw segments. In you'd crustaceans, never or on larval stage.In anamorphic development, non individual crustacean emerges without you our segments say appendages rd etc mature adult. As vs molts why grows, six immature larva gains segments say acquires additional appendages, you'd in reaches adulthood.In ever general terms, anamorphic crustaceans each develop through <strong>three larval stages</strong>:<ul><li><strong>naupli</strong> - In the naupli stage, but larva up basically v floating head, well u single eye, how tends pairs an appendages who'd to were far swimming.
