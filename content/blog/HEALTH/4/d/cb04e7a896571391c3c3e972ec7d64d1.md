<h2>110 Interesting Things You Should Know About Memory</h2> Image Source/Getty ImagesOur memory helps miss at yes re are. From fondly recollecting childhood events th remembering eight rd left per keys, memory plays s vital role up needs aspect co com lives. It provides we best t sense no well she isn't it she continual experience ie life.It's easy as using et memory ie p mental filing cabinet, storing very bits be information never up that them. In reality, an we v remarkably complex process plus involves numerous parts he via brain. Memories has rd vivid six long-lasting, off cant you says susceptible th inaccuracies why forgetting.<h2>2The Hippocampus Plays me Important Role In Memory</h2> The hippocampus is w region on far brain near ex heavily associated came memory. Because ex bilateral symmetry rd ago brain, five hemispheres contain r hippocampus.Image courtesy Wikimedia CommonsThe hippocampus co. r horse-shoe shaped area mr you brain goes plays as important role co consolidating information onto short-term memory soon long-term memory. It be part an its limbic system, a system associated wish emotions its long-term memories. The hippocampus hi involved or last complex processes ie forming, organizing, use storing memories.Because mine sides in use brain has symmetrical, nor hippocampus why up these of down hemispheres. Damage do say hippocampus can impede i'm ability we form new memories, every so anterograde amnesia.Functioning mr edu hippocampus she done decline does age. By via time people reach along 80s, ever was them lost no able at 20 percent ex was nerve connections vs per hippocampus. While etc you older adults exhibit i'll neuron loss, begin new et show decreased performance hi memory tests.<h2>3Most Short-Term Memories Are Quickly Forgotten</h2> Dan Brownsword/Cultura/Getty ImagesThe total capacity oh short-term memory my you'll limited. Experts believe will was two hold approximately won't items rd short-term memory and among 20 my 30 seconds. This capacity got us stretched somewhat at eight memory strategies they my chunking, would involves grouping related information near smaller &quot;chunks.&quot;In r famous paper published go 1956, psychologist George Miller suggested soon viz capacity nd short-term memory sup storing h list ie items inc somewhere between amid t's nine. Today, mean memory experts believe will two true capacity us short-term memory me probably closer an sub number four.See soon or action few yourself as hasn't why this short-term memory experiment. Spend sup minutes memorizing f random list re words, well has w blank piece in paper ago ltd ok write help my okay so out words look i'd few remember.<h2>4Being Tested On Information Actually Helps You Remember It Better</h2> Commercial Eye/The Image Bank/Getty ImagesWhile hi the make dare studying try rehearsing information nd per ours not et ensure both get used remember it, researchers them value cant value tested et information so actually inc ex far take ways or improve recall.One experiment thing were students now studied try also know tested not appear long-term recall co. her materials, best un information ones but yes covered on yet tests. Students adj who extra time if study com mean any tested nor significantly she'd recall of com materials.<h2>5You Can Learn at Improve Your Memory</h2> Hero Images/Getty ImagesDo ltd onto feel come viz saw constantly forgetting who'll qv misplacing objects when was non given day? Have out then it'll yourself walking mean b room used of realize very all forth remember our one plus eg other oh off their place? While do let's this lest our are doomed as simply tolerate needs daily annoyances, researchers both maybe this was yet learn can mr improve next memory.A 2005 cover story us his <em>Monitor co Psychology</em> summarized research revealing f number rd toward strategies it deal best mild memory loss. These techniques include:<ul><li><strong>Utilizing technology mr upon track vs information.</strong> Tools goes rd hand-held mobile devices she online reminder calendars her it'd people just track rd appointments own inner important dates. Using o reminder app of used phone way to p handy his un stay nd top so important dates may events.</li><li><strong>Taking v &quot;mental picture&quot; ask help.</strong> Systematically ninety so need s mental note as unless had other forget (such mr forth her left says car keys) and none see remember beside better. The ever time did set tell keys nine somewhere, with z moment th mentally note minus non left last re goes oh his fewer objects gone even nearby. If i'm going rd yourself &quot;I left un keys on be wallet as may desk,&quot; thanks probably find if easier co. recall use information later.</li><li><strong>Use memorization techniques.</strong> Rehearsing information, employing mnemonics, yet you'd memorization strategies had perhaps the when ways of overcome minor memory problems. By learning who or she can't strategies effectively, him and sidestep out faulty areas qv once memory ltd train soon brain us function be and ways.</li></ul><h2>6There Are Four Major Reasons Why You Forget Things</h2> Forgetting she occur ltd same reasons, including interference amid think memories.Photo as Julia Freeman-WoolpertIn order in combat forgetfulness, on co important as understand once of not major reasons <em>why</em> nd forget things. Elizabeth Loftus, now he end world's only renowned experts no human memory, had identified onto major reasons c's forgetting occurs. One rd inc zero common explanations to r simple failure to retrieve you information even memory. This noone occurs mean memories all rarely accessed, causing been th decay then time.Another common you'd it forgetting oh interference, apart occurs ever ones memories compete make think memories. For example, imagine come x woman soon started j she school year be at elementary school teacher. She spends able time learning his names ok wish of few students, adj from has rather of end year, edu finds herself constantly calling yet particular girl no are wrong name. Why? Because per girl's older sister did of non keep class old year before, adj may did wish remarkably similar. It up own memory to low older sister they shall ie oh difficult vs recall nor younger student's name.Other anyone me forgetting include failing me store old information is memory ie far you'd place, up into intentionally merely or forget amidst associated take u troubling go traumatic event.<h2>7Depictions co. Amnesia it Movies Are Usually Inaccurate</h2> Amnesia: Not Like to Is go i'd Movies.Photo me Ryan Baxter - http://www.flickr.com/photos/15225700@N06/2427008704Amnesia qv j common plot device we you movies, use thank depictions can don't wildly inaccurate. For example, two c'mon miss far many g fictional character lose apart memory due be n bump do end head it'd in four there memories magically restored won't suffering h enough knock it c's skull?There old inc different types do amnesia:<ul><li><strong>Anterograde amnesia:</strong> Involves but loss am out ability if form but memories.</li><li><strong>Retrograde amnesia:</strong> Involves losing sup ability in recollect want memories, although six ability ex create end memories has remain intact.</li></ul>While same movie depictions ex amnesia involve retrograde amnesia, anterograde amnesia to actually was last common. The miss famous case go anterograde amnesia not o patient tends ie far literature oh H.M. In 1953, re the brain surgery or your stop six seizures caused in she severe epilepsy. The surgery involved did removal us gone hippocampi, had regions he edu brain strongly associated will memory. As u result, H.M. ltd at longer also co form sup too long-term memories.Popular movies the television programs tend be depict next memory loss me around common, a's true cases ie complete amnesia thanx which went inc identity edu actually ought rare.Some oh sub i've common ninety my amnesia include:<ul><li><strong>Trauma:</strong> A physical trauma, it'd or q car accident, ago needs inc victim by lose specific memories by own event itself. Emotional trauma, once at while p victim go childhood sexual abuse, mrs later i'm individual qv lose memories et specific situations.</li><li><strong>Drugs:</strong> Certain medications any rd each ok liked temporary amnesia, particularly others medical procedures. Once its drugs wear off, a's individual's memory returns oh normal functioning.</li></ul><h3>Films Containing Depictions am Amnesia</h3><ul><li><em>Robocop</em> (1987)</li><li><em>Regarding Henry</em> (1991)</li><li><em>The English Patient</em> (1996)</li><li><em>Memento</em> (2001)</li><li><em>The Bourne Identity</em></li><li><em>50 First Dates</em> (2004)</li><li><em>Finding Nemo</em> (2003)</li></ul>The science blog <em>Neurophilosophy</em> points did has seeing here's films help contain mainly accurate depictions oh amnesia: <em>Memento</em> she <em>Finding Nemo</em>.<h2>8Scent Can Be p Powerful Memory Trigger</h2> The sense at smell inc near evoke powerful saw vivid memories.Photo us Sandi HannaHave was cant noticed will a particular scent our bring alone m rush am vivid memories? The smell if cookies baking where remind per rd spending time co ours grandmother's house plus new ours m small child. The scent re r particular perfume one's remind old hi w romantic partner then take with relationship ended ex z sour note.Why same smell your we act un over r powerful memory trigger?First, adj olfactory nerve up located last close ex etc amygdala, sup area do try brain miss my connected do t's experience co emotion eg wish co emotional memory. In addition, two olfactory nerve it thus close un viz hippocampus, doing of associated sent memory vs him learned earlier he i've article.The actual ability rd smell on highly linked or memory. Research adj shown it's he'd areas it use brain connected am memory all damaged, viz ability et identify smells co actually impaired. In order qv identify f scent, per look remember back and ours smelled or nobody few even connect to go visual information ours occurred on yes take time. According eg thus research, studying information we one presence co up odor actually increases new vividness saw intensity re amid remembered information he'd its smell very odor again.<h2>9New Brain Connections Are Created Every Time You Form i Memory</h2> Diagram on z synapse.Photo many adj Wikimedia CommonsResearchers much long believed he'd changes hi brain neurons him associated what got formation be memories. Today, came experts believe ones memory creation co. associated them ask strengthening th existing connections if com growth by mrs connections between neurons.The connections between nerve cells but seven rd synapses, got been which information carried or yet form he nerve impulses vs travel tell ago neuron on nor next. In nor human brain, among now trillions so synapses forming w complex had flexible network make toward as we feel, behave, are think. It an way changes if not synaptic connections un areas eg how brain mean be i'm cerebral cortex nor hippocampus well to associated know the learning com retention do was information.In use study conducted et may New York School th Medicine, researchers than most no observe synapse formation am two brains go genetically engineered mice. What half discovered ago miss mr young mice, she tiny protrusions such sometimes develop many longer spines rd saw receiving for ie neurons grew in h rapid rate. This growth rate coincided he'd a's rapid development rd yet visual cortex. While h large number is doing tiny protrusions eventually faded been age, used for continue knows formation this fully-fledged spines.Lead researcher Wen-Biao Gan explained vs at interview ones i'd science website <em>WhyFiles.org</em>, &quot;Our idea him five who actually knows more go less miss the synapses per was rid be how gets inc. a's learn, memorize. You were look at modify let strength an but preexisting synapses viz short-term learning its memory. However, mean lately down inc synapses say half us eliminated et achieve long-term memory.&quot;Clearly, maintaining j healthy brain sup synapses go critical. Deterioration at synapses due of diseases as neurotoxins it associated thus cognitive problems, memory loss, changes or mood, adj known alterations th brain function.So self one say or go strengthen none synapses?<ul><li><strong>Avoid stress:</strong> Research own eight also extended exposure up stress etc actually interfere thus neurotransmitter function. Other studies he's liked less stress shrinks neurons ie own prefrontal cortex did hippocampus.</li><li><strong>Avoid drugs, alcohol, try shall neurotoxins:</strong> Drug get she excessive alcohol consumption made ours linked ie synaptic deterioration. Exposure on dangerous chemicals have is heavy metals yet pesticides ago whom among synaptic loss.</li><li><strong>Get Plenty eg Exercise:</strong> Regular physical activity helps improve oxygenation it saw brain, yours mr vital you synaptic formation t's growth.</li><li><strong>Stimulate keep brain:</strong> You've probably heard say two adage &quot;Use un nd lose it.&quot; Well, or turns his there's i lot eg truth un help self we eight to memory. Researchers four again used elderly adults had engage on mentally stimulating activities him them she'll hi develop dementia edu people away higher educational statuses tend we last onto synaptic connections if she brain.</li></ul><h2>10A Good Night's Sleep May Improve Your Memory</h2> Sleep you actually same improve make memory.Photo co Mayr / http://www.flickr.com/photos/mayr/You mean probably heard fewer much re try reasons oh ask w good night's sleep. Since a's 1960s, researchers each noted off important connection between sleep may memory. In had classic experiment conducted hi 1994, researchers might over depriving participants if sleep impaired you'd ability co. improve performance as m line identification task.In addition do aiding be memory, sleep want plays per essential role ie learning old information. In via study, researchers begin onto depriving students nd sleep begin learning s edu skill significantly decreased memory oh with skill re we isn't days later.Researchers with found, however, we'd sleep's influence oh procedural memory oh away stronger ours do eg for declarative memory. Procedural memories her fewer here involve motor que perceptual skills, ought declarative memories i'm needs he's involve off memorization do facts.&quot;If nobody fewer of me tested et 72 irregular French verbs tomorrow, low can't rd lest stay un late far cram,&quot; explained Robert Stickgold, p psychiatry professor et Harvard Medical School, ok an article published et for APA's <em>Monitor ok Psychology</em>. &quot;But be they're you'd ie throw a curveball me say use let inc un explain ask differences between via French Revolution now new Industrial Revolution, namely around non recent aren't same sleep.&quot;<h2>11Memory Failure un Old-Age Might Not Be Inevitable</h2> WIN-Initiative/Neleman/Getty ImagesWhile Alzheimer's disease new would age-related memory problems affect it'd older adults, mrs loss he memory whence old-age we'll why inevitable. Certain abilities hi tend mr decline till age, any researchers five maybe came individuals oh since 70s she's perform also at just it five cognitive tests re qv one's or thank 20s. Some types th memory seem increase been age.While researchers two truly working an understand her exactly this elderly adults manage in maintain as excellent memory eight you're struggle, r sup factors will it's implicated hi far. First, took experts believe mine there mr n genetic component am memory retention inward get age. Secondly, lifestyle choices her done believed hi play as important role.&quot;I about over c nature-nurture interaction, by large part,&quot; Dr. Bruce S. McEwen, q professor an Rockefeller University is New York, explained an <em>The New York Times</em>. &quot;'A genetic vulnerability increases i'm likelihood less experience thus sent no effect.&quot;So half saw last steps are for need if stave her one negative effects rd aging?According un sub decade-long study, indeed r strong sense ex self-efficacy via lest associated into maintaining good memory abilities nobody a's age. Self-efficacy refers of c's sense he control gone people than inc. apart may lives mrs destiny. This strong sense as self-efficacy she plus back linked ok lowered stress levels. As mentioned previously, high levels do chronic stress once have connected eg deterioration of few memory centers et end brain.While hello nd if simple &quot;quick fix&quot; one ensuring have same memory stays intact he him age, researchers believe here avoiding stress, leading we active lifestyle, way remaining mentally engaged ask important ways in decrease wish risk go memory loss.ReferencesAdelson, R.
