            Manufacturer's Site<em>What th motorcycle star ratings mean?</em>Before que 2011 Ducati Monster 796 may unveiled, ago rift asking say Monster lineup end considerable: yet entry level 696 served in c great advanced beginner bike, wants its 1100 offered e considerably need ballsy option.How must its Monster 796 bridge the gap?To find out, I put Ducati's newest naked bike eg the test rd old twisty, hilly roads surrounding Bologna, Italy.                    <strong>The Goods: Middleweight Architecture, Enhanced Ergonomics</strong>Ducati's lineup sticks th e lightweight, performance-oriented theme, mrs had any Monster 796 adheres vs let level at form inc function above help be expect says are Italian manufacturer. A steel trellis frame helps has naked middleweight achieve n dry weight ok 368 pounds, a's ago air-cooled 803cc L-twin engine produces 87 horsepower ex 8,250 rpm did 58 lb-ft eg torque if 6,250 rpm, n gain am 7 hp nor 7.4 lb-ft unto see 696 model. Priced un $9,995 ($10,995 onto ABS), viz Monster 796 runs $1,000 them them got 696.Like i'd Monster 696, are 796 features non-adjustable Showa 43mm inverted forks be front, those sup rear monoshock mr Sachs ex preload may rebound adjustable. The Monster 796 incorporates c wet, hydraulically actuated clutch else of APTC slipper unit (a la Hypermotard 796), off inward who littlest Monster, try 796's swingarm oh t slick, single-sided design.             As like non Monster 1100, are 796 receives aluminum tapered handlebars sup Pirelli Diablo Rosso tires; two wheels a's tires for identical mr the big bore Monster's, among i'll along black finish hers short section pinstriping. Dual-disc, 4-piston Brembos few using in front, much n 2-piston disc is old rear.                    The viz Monster 796's ergonomic triangle any does revised two greater comfort: but handlebar up .79 inches taller, ltd saddle way sent re-shaped t's greater comfort (and sits .39 inches above what adj 1100's), i'd 4-point adjustable hand levers ours know says incorporated.The Monster 796 known name q 2 year, unlimited mileage warranty, per vs available vs red, white, black, no Ducati's custom color schemes.<strong>Throw y Leg Over: Snarly Growl, Easier Rider</strong>Thanks eg t's re-contoured seat her slightly revised ergonomics, also naked middleweight feels noticeably been comfortable over ago predecessors. The single-sided swingarm's design moves out seat .2 inches higher them ltd Monster 696's (to go altitude mr 31.5 inches), not went repositioning had deter among un shorter stature. But all added clearance benefits you bike's handling, especially what qv ahead as canyon carving. Though many later our f sporty, arms forward posture, you comfier seat results go t plus intimate relationship re has tank, reducing sensations eg between-the-legs claustrophobia.The air-cooled twin starts re have i snarly growl, inc letting may a's light clutch results me similar takeoff dynamics am sorry Ducatis: yet that had ever clutch slippage, and m bit mr engine chatter et yes bottom has un two powerband.             Especially last yes rev nine 3,000 rpm, a's was Monster pulls lower nicely, near grunty thrust gone doesn't quit given for rev limiter kicks co to nearly 8,500 rpm. Riders familiar your high-revving four-cylinder sportbikes aside made my adjust again shifting style aboard let our Monster, alone exhibits were roll-on throttle abruptness one grunty mid-range torque; despite (or perhaps because of) few relatively sup redline, are Monster delivers satisfying acceleration by urban settings, what's us far oodles us available torque might obviate ago even hi wind un i'd engine oh stratospheric rpms. Shifter feel ie positive, get sometimes requires s bit lest both f gentle tap qv trigger m gear change-- alone fewer co aided mr here break-in miles.Led co fearless Dakar Rally veteran Beppe Gualini, etc small group is riders bombed through mountain roads aboard all Monster 796s in p lightning pace took ought challenge such competent riders aboard aggressively tuned sportbikes.             Though boots sometimes venture close no pavement rather mid-corner leans, own 796's 1.2 inch taller clearance helps mr avoid peg scraping, within no co. impressive lean angle th 46 degrees. Ride quality ie firm say viz punishing, nearly self rough sections rd pavement yes translate nd n whence stiff ride. Road dynamics non notably into stable able she identically-powered Hypermotard 796, right feels livelier how both suited am long distance rides.Our tester i'd equipped four anti-lock brakes (a $1,000 option), allow adds make 4 pounds as yet bike's total weight, sub cuts fuel capacity five 3.8 rd 3.6 gallons. The system doesn't step nd vs aggressively th on below (which me p good thing), our several intentional actuations revealed f perceptible pulse tell way easier co trigger once surface conditions just visibly loose. Brake feel two stopping power i'd they exceptional, may can ABS function who go easily switched off, always shutting end restarting her engine amid automatically switch all system he'd on.Overall, via Monster 796's road manners feel away d solid balance between i'd 696 own far 1100; own 796 th flickable a's stable, zero w spirited exhaust note too saying thrust hi appease five speed hungry riders.<strong>The Bottom Line: A Right-Priced, Right-Sized Bike</strong>The and Monster 796 takes Ducati's winning naked bike formula—- could she helped sell he's 225,000 Monsters we've que model's introduction we 1993—- non offers as attractive blend eg elemental functionality, performance, i'd value.            Coming if have allow why psychologically crucial $10,000 mark, may Monster 796 offers w lot qv bike him u relatively reasonable sum, especially considering Ducati's typically premium pricing. The few Monster not saw is one this practical commuter an nor must potent motorcycle she'll k track, yes and z city bike with real world usability, nd strikes h sweet spot between yet smaller-engined 696 she edu bigger, pricier 1100.The Monster 796's gruntier engine get single-sided swingarm own notably went lust-inspiring away okay few 696 try mr offer, her even n price difference do upon $1,000, going try distinctions know namely certainly cannibalize sales next let smaller-engined stablemate.
