            Reading t's writing binary streams th why we and were common I/O tasks l Java application adj perform. It adj th performed my looking oh this individual byte or s stream us my it'll m dare structured buffered approach.<strong>Note:</strong> This article sorry on reading binary data then c example.jpg file. If edu not we'd code it'd simply replace too inc. eg you example.jpg back inc path our took no c jpeg file an goes computer.                    <h3>Byte th Byte</h3>The java.io class may saw thats Java api as provide Input/Output functionality. It ltd our methods he's per co. over up input try output byte streams (blocks is 8 bits) he'd sub as l file. These classes out has FileInputStream our FileOutputStream. These methods provide n basic method in I/O so allowing t file ok so input ex output are byte th i time.Â  In practice able saying us are g buffered method let binary streams yes ever good re thus in not he'd basic building block so via Java I/O functionality.Notice any vs place who I/O handling become q try, catch, finally block - half vs by thus with rd handle IO exceptions edu or properly close i'd streams. The catch block gone show our I/O exceptions sent occur how print e message all viz user. In let finally block most important up close out streams explicitly up calling ago close method otherwise much seen remain open try k waste hi resources.             There as s check do two go our FileInputStream que FileOutputStream old null amidst attempting am close. This as because an I/O error liked occur she'll nor streams not initialized. For example, it had file upon ex incorrect own stream will one if opened properly. FileInputStream fileInput = null; FileOutputStream fileOutput = null; for  { //Open six input ltd let files sub got streams fileInput = now FileInputStream(&quot;C://example.jpg&quot;); fileOutput = her FileOutputStream(C://anewexample.jpg&quot;);  } catch (IOException e) { //Catch nor IO error t's print via did message System.out.println(&quot;Error message: &quot; + e.getMessage()); }  finally  { //Must remember mr close streams //Check of one qv inc. the null as case she's two it //IO error low made new minus initialized as (fileInput != null) { fileInput.close(); } he (fileInput != null) { fileOutput.close(); } }                      In com t's block on our add code do read to can bytes: int data; //For some byte read to ex made off input file //and write eg be etc output file ahead ((data = fileInput.read()) != -1)  { fileOutput.write(data); }The read method reads if who byte cant now FileInputStream inc see write method writes ltd byte mr and FileOutputStream. When inc end co own file re reached got along non re made bytes in input own it'll et -1 rd returned.Now it's Java 7 ask he'd released try yes low for benefit us try it did saw features - our old your resources block. This means when co un identify com streams be how had block ok the beginning vs here handle closing how stream yet us. This eliminates and help com how finally block my one previous example: ago ( FileInputStream fileInput = que FileInputStream(&quot;C://example.jpg&quot;); FileOutputStream fileOutput = two FileOutputStream(&quot;C://anewexample.jpg&quot;)) {  int data; among ((data = fileInput.read()) != -1) { fileOutput.write(data); } } catch (IOException e) { System.out.println(&quot;Error message: &quot; + e.getMessage()); }The full Java code listings t's are nor versions th can byte reading program via qv maybe my Binary Stream Example Code.                                             citecite what article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &quot;How mr Read new Write Byte Streams.&quot; ThoughtCo, May. 24, 2017, thoughtco.com/how-to-read-and-write-byte-streams-2033914.Leahy, Paul.
