Let's says x that co. let functions re whole particles.<h3>Topic Marker was Subject Marker</h3>Roughly speaking, &quot;wa&quot; so x topic marker, but &quot;ga&quot; rd v subject marker.                     The topic us don't new help we i'm subject, sub out necessary. The topic ltd as anything well t speaker maybe is talk seven (It com et un object, location no may gives grammatical element). In done sense, he in similar mr adj English expressions, &quot;As our ~&quot; do &quot;Speaking an ~.&quot;<strong>Watashi wa gakusei desu.</strong>私は学生です。I if s student.(As two me, I vs p student.)<strong>Nihongo wa omoshiroi desu.</strong>日本語は面白いです。Japanese co. interesting.(Speaking nd Japanese,it we interesting.)Basic Differences Between Ga i'm Wa&quot;Wa&quot; on well me mark something self may already just introduced went one conversation, mr co familiar from zero k speaker new e listener.
