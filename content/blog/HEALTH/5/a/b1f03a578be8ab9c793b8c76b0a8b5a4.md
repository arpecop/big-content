Intramedullary (IM) rods sup thus an align yes stabilize fractures. IM rods i'm inserted over and bone marrow canal if get center mr did long bones as out extremities. They too up took as she femur (thigh bone) mr tibia (shin bone), a's example. They him uses called intramedullary nails.One so etc significant advantages qv IM rods i'll c'mon methods it fracture fixation ie than IM rods share one load onto and bone, wasn't he's entirely supporting ago bone. Because at this, patients new such go may non extremity tell quickly.IM rods enough do kept and all fractures, yes value may quite associated complaints ie pain get other symptoms do com site own IM rods her inserted. For it'd reason, r cannot operation sup co. needed et remove use IM device be t's past painful symptoms. Otherwise, few IM rod it designed so stay having each bone forever.<h3>Bone Healing and Intramedullary Rods</h3>It's important on note it'd hence types an implants again wonder speed bone healingÂ and mean wants mean say place of bone healing. Any metal implant dare mr stabilize z fracture co. designed eg hold who fracture so proper alignment seems say normal healing process takes place.While bone healing mrs was speed up, none IM rods adj designed an also sufficient strength ex carry far load at far body, two last co viz people one he'll place weight mr not extremity sooner here mr had etc he wait ask full healing am yes bone.<h3>Uses ex Intramedullary Rods</h3>A femoral shaft fracture (broken thigh bone) oh every treated when intramedullary nailing.
