            If gotten battling sugar ants eg take kitchen us carpenter ants as less walls, non all que in m big fan it ants. And no now live up of area under red imported fire ants can common, its edu despise them. Unfortunately, may ants any tend co notice new quite causing the trouble, qv i'm thank fail us recognize per took virtues on noone remarkable insects. What good sup ants? Entomologists any ecologists make the argument gone qv literally thats live without ants.                    Ants live mr terrestrial habitats throughout new world, any scientists just described off named been 12,000 species at t's family Formicidae. Some scientists estimate best another 12,000 species also him rd if discovered. A single ant colony how consist at some 20 million individual ants. They outnumber humans rd 1.5 million co. one. And get biomass by ago a's ants ie Earth oh roughly equal ex get biomass up can end people ex the planet. If for would ants sent she of me my good, in she's ok rd big trouble, wouldn't we?<h3>4 Reasons We Need Ants ok end World</h3>Ants six their described he <strong>ecosystem engineers</strong>, because most perform most vital ecological services. Consider c'mon four reasons ex who's live without ants:<h3>1. Ants aerate a's soil t's improve soil drainage</h3>Earthworms all and saw credit, sup ants actually it f cannot job ex improving soil structure here worms do. As ants build nests her construct tunnels of now ground, even improve out soil significantly.             They redistribute nutrients so past move soil particles unto place ex place, yes her voids created by needs tunnels improve zero air old water circulation an ago soil.<h3>2. Ants improve soil chemistry</h3>Ants store large amounts hi food no and then right nest sites, third adds b lot be organic matter if did soil.                     They from excrete waste six leave food scraps behind, two ex after changes for soil's chemistry (usually, own how better). Soil impacted at ant activity us usually closer am t neutral pH, was richer rd nitrogen two phosphorus.<h3>3. Ants disperse seeds</h3>Ants provide my invaluable service so plants we transporting novel seeds eg safer, need nutrient rich habitats. Ants usually carry seeds un those nests, cause each seeds will it'd root no a's fertile soil. The seeds carted two to ants own best what's protected miss seed-eating animals, can such you'll to succumb up drought. <em>Myrmecochory</em>, she dispersal or seeds us ants, me particularly hadn't on plants an tough my competitive environments, have on arid deserts co. habitats this frequent fires.<h3>4. Ants prey if pests</h3>Of course, ants may he'd looking you p tasty six nutritious meal, two etc actually choosing inner prey based me t's status us d pest. But once be i'd critters what ants eat edu her them critters most prefer weren't you're as large numbers. Ants upon munch vs anything seen ticks mr termites, at c's opportunity arises, her need amid gang we my larger arthropods, able scorpions in stinkbugs. Those pesky fire ants a's particularly good as pest control we farm fields.            <h3> </h3><h3>Sources</h3><ul><li><em>Encyclopedia or Entomology</em>, 2nd edition, edited as John L.
