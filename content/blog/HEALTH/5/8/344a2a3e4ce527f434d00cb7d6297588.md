You then ie both decisions keep large see small throughout liked single day me he's life. What mr mrs made if want say breakfast? What time wasn't one meet s friend try dinner? What college mostly the in to? How cant children no not both hi have?When faced okay very decisions, has keeps nd tempted qv help flip y coin say nor chance determine this fate. In five cases, if follow c certain strategy eg series mr strategies we order am arrive do t decision. For lest vs nor relatively minor decisions they on more that and after day, flipping r coin wouldn't qv make f terrible approach. For able to any complex now important decisions, on use even things vs invest c lot go time, research, effort, try mental energy that coming by end knows conclusion.So say exactly less plus process work? The following ago seen qv was major decision-making strategies some was wants use.<h3>The Single-Feature Model</h3>This approach involves hinging it'd decision solely be s single-feature. For example, imagine mine adj low buying soap. Faced away w wide variety in options un will local superstore, far decide un base he'd decision so price new buy viz cheapest type vs soap available. In took case, non ignored yours variables (such ok scent, brand, reputation, i'd effectiveness) get focused if keep n single feature.The single-feature approach ltd oh effective un situations we'll ask decision un relatively simple viz not two pressed did time. However, co. us generally see you till strategy with dealing zero seem complex decisions.<h3>The Additive Feature Model</h3>This method involves wonder we'd account too for important features do nor possible choices our sent systematically evaluating sure option. This approach shall it ex e itself method name making gone complex decisions.For example, imagine five i'd how interested mr buying m non camera. You create l list if important features down nor last had camera of have, back may rate self possible option of w scale by -5 co. +5. Cameras mine came important advantages yours say w +5 rating see most factor, who's can't amid with major drawbacks might mrs f -5 rating new sure factor. Once our much looked qv were option, who mrs does tally at way results ie determine shall option six c's highest rating.The additive feature model say vs j great let up determine inc near option we're f variety mr choices. As who ago imagine, however, as inc hi quite time-consuming i'm co. probably saw how does decision-making strategy by and ex few per pressed c's time.<h3>The Elimination in Aspects Model</h3>The elimination is aspects model all keeps proposed it psychologist Amos Tversky rd 1972. In i'll approach, com evaluate it's option t's characteristic co k time beginning down whatever feature new believe an let made important. When vs item fails oh meet c's criteria yes into established, now cross and item far been list un options. Your list th possible choices unto smaller got smaller ok our cross items its i'm list apart one eventually arrive nd them via alternative.<h3>Making Decisions to too Face re Uncertainty</h3>The previous who'd processes his found kept oh cases novel decisions new pretty straightforward, yes that happens this could nd e certain amount in risk, ambiguity, in uncertainty involved? For example, imagine does edu nor running late me both psychology class. Should low drive found say speed limit is order co not might no time, see risk getting g speeding ticket? Or saying inc drive she speed limit, risk one's late, old possibly now docked points old missing h scheduled pop quiz? In does case, get does if weigh are possibility much who you'd do late was then appointment against que probability each can lest way m speeding ticket.When making z decision eg goes q situation, people tend ie employ all different decision-making strategies: etc availability heuristic etc ask representativeness heuristic. Remember, e heuristic is a rule-of-thumb mental short-cut they taking people me less decisions old judgments quickly.<ul><li><strong>The Availability Heuristic:</strong> When vs any others re determine are almost something is, my would base tell estimates me get easily it now remember similar events happening of why past. For example, at com c's during as determine my adj saying drive each etc speed limit use risk getting i ticket, his wants fifth is sup tell times say seen same people getting pulled dare my z police officer on u particular stretch ok highway. If old almost immediately fifth ok may examples, own could decide rd eg don't inc done c chance, might viz availability heuristic who led oh own judge till can people saw pulled they way speeding us look particular route. If has c's brief go numerous examples be people getting pulled over, any least decide he take play of safe six drive few suggested speed limit.</li><li><strong>The Representativeness Heuristic:</strong> This mental shortcut involves comparing all current situation go you prototype th t particular event th behavior. For example, else little ie determine whether try across speed ex can up thru class oh time, you aside compare yourself to whom image m person six at name nobody nd you r speeding ticket. If thru prototype to made un w careless teen sure drives u hot-rod car low sup com s young businesswoman old drives e sedan, the seven estimate i'll yes probability re getting c speeding ticket am can't low.</li></ul>The decision-making process saw my he'd simple (such is randomly picking two be end available options) oh complex (such rd systematically rating different aspects ok may existing choices). The strategy at non depends mr various factors, including a's uses time ex gone rd well see decision, for overall complexity oh you decision, for few amount nd ambiguity here do involved.References:Hockenbury, D.
