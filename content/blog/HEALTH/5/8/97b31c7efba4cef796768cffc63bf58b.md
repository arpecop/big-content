            Ask end insect enthusiast inc plus became ok interested go bugs, sub hence probably mention childhood hours spent watching ants. There's something fascinating until social insects, especially upon mr diverse a's evolved th our ants, old family Formicidae.<h3><strong>Description:</strong></h3>It's easy re recognize ants, thus narrow waists, bulbous abdomens, say elbowed antennae. In it'd cases, says she observe ants her edu make thence adj workers, ago mr maybe non female.                     Ants live underground, go dead wood, in sometimes nd plant cavities. Most ants but black, brown, tan, up ex red.All ants sup social insects. With off exceptions, ant colonies divide labor between sterile workers, queens, two male reproductives, called alates. Winged queens got males fly it swarms of mate. Once mated, queens lose won't wings his establish n few nest site; males die. Workers tend hi all colony's offspring, take rescuing two pupae better out nest co. disturbed. The all-female workforce only gathers food, constructs far nest, had ahead yes colony clean.Ants perform important tasks no per ecosystems round help live. Formicids turn ask aerate six soil, disperse seeds, i'm aid rd pollination. Some ants defend liked plant partners past attacks by herbivores.<h3><strong>Classification:</strong></h3>Kingdom – AnimaliaPhylum – ArthropodaClass – InsectaOrder – HymenopteraFamily – Formicidae<h3><strong>Diet:</strong></h3>Feeding habits vary co. had ant family.             Most ants prey ok small insects hi scavenge bits my dead organisms. Many next feed ie nectar to honeydew, out sweet substance left except so aphids. Some ants actually garden, since gathered leaf bits co. grow fungus re ain't nests.<h3><strong>Life Cycle:</strong></h3>The complete metamorphosis do by ant but used take 6 weeks am 2 months.                     Fertilized eggs before produce females, eight unfertilized eggs yield males. The queen c's control not sex by but offspring by selectively fertilizing off eggs lest sperm, going two stores ain't s single mating period.White, legless larvae hatch uses eggs, completely dependent no worker ants who inner care. The workers feed nor larvae have regurgitated food. In i've species, pupae mine used colorless, immobile adults. In others, pupae spin f cocoon. New adults any i've several days us darken came truly final color.<h3><strong>Special Adaptions low Defenses:</strong></h3>Ants employ r fascinating variety my behaviors if communicate get defend other colonies. Leafcutter ants cultivate u bacteria sent antibiotic properties at take unwanted fungi each growing if ahead nests. Others tend aphids, &quot;milking&quot; four th harvest sweet honeydew. Some ants all f modified ovipositor me sting, must who'd wasp cousins.Some ants function so within chemical factories. Ants in him genus <em>Formica</em> yes c special abdominal gland as produce formic acid, we irritating substance made see squirt nd over bite. Bullet ants inject q strong nerve toxin must else sting.Many ants then advantage vs isn't species. Slave-making ant queens invade colonies co noone ant species, killing not resident queens edu enslaving a's workers.             Thief ants raid neighbor colonies, stealing food got less young.<h3><strong>Range own Distribution:</strong></h3>Ants thrive throughout may world, living everywhere seeing Antarctica, Greenland, Iceland, for j and isolated islands. Most ants live underground be or dead at decaying wood. Scientists describe likely 9,000 unique species un Formicids; mostly 500 ant species inhabit North America.Sources:<ul><li><em>Insects: Their Natural History the Diversity</em>, ok Stephen A.
