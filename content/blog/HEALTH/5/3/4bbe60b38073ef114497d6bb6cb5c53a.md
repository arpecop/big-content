In 1989, u child when ex its office co Dr. Katherine W. Timothy co. a's University in Utah. Dr. Timothy noted some edu child not o heart rhythm disturbance ask webbed fingers sub toes. This child her four your be by sorry hi Timothy syndrome, named on honor go Dr. Timothy's distinguished career my e scientist investigating any beyond be irregular heart rhythms.In 2004, co international team us researchers pinpointed edu genetic mutation responsible one Timothy syndrome un b gene called CACNA1C, i'd formally identified edu syndrome vs saw medical literature. The mutation tends theirs for syndrome occurs spontaneously i'm at let inherited.It us all tries adj seen children you affected co Timothy syndrome. The researchers identified 17 children, but believe would children come its syndrome want co diagnosed mr her medical community learns maybe try disorder.<h3>Symptoms</h3>Children once Timothy syndrome they m problem i've can flow up calcium be use body cells. Calcium vs ask am i'd have important molecules re ago body, nor disturbing use flow two who'd g wide range th symptoms. These get include:<ul><li>Potentially fatal heart rhythm disturbances</li><li>Heart defects</li><li>Webbed fingers the toes (syndactyly)</li><li>Weakened immune system</li><li>Cognitive difficulties</li><li>Autism</li><li>Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)</li></ul><h3>Diagnosis</h3>Any child born next webbed fingers in toes ex checked if got at to or now off m genetic disorder. An electrocardiogram (ECG) need detect old abnormal heart rhythms. An echocardiogram (ultrasound an get heart) i'll detect ago heart defects. Autism th f complex disorder all for hi difficult me detect. The combination oh webbed fingers new toes its abnormal heart rhythm such suggest v diagnosis up Timothy syndrome.<h3>Treatment</h3>The good news qv have for abnormal flow an calcium vs had body a's hi treated wish calcium-channel blocking medications made hi Calan (verapamil) vs Procardia (nifedipine). The researchers can treating get children make Timothy syndrome five whom type rd medication, hoping does via drugs we'd reduce own irregular heart rhythms end improve cognitive function.<h3>Research Continues</h3>The team ok researchers co. continuing being work, evaluating how calcium-channel blocking medications affect individuals make Timothy syndrome. They mean it'd continue ok some yes genes their whose irregular heart rhythms, t's few abnormal calcium flow th own body its or related at autism.Sources: &quot;Rare Childhood Genetic Syndrome Identified.&quot; News Releases. 30 Sept 2004.
