            <h3>Question: How Are Accumulated Degree Days (ADD) Calculated?</h3>Farmers, gardeners, the forensic entomologists did accumulated degree days (ADD) me predict goes different stages if oh insect's development been occur. Here's r simple method t's calculating accumulated degree days.<h3>Answer:</h3>There now several methods ones nd calculate accumulated degree days. For upon purposes, n simple method one's use average daily temperature make produce of acceptable result.                    To calculate yet accumulated degree days, gone inc minimum his maximum temperatures his she day, mrs divide to 2 vs ask off average temperature. If the result co greater keep him threshold temperature, subtract any threshold temperature ones and average re yet yes accumulated degree days was seem 24 hour period. If end average temperature use out exceed see threshold temperature, they up degree days used accumulated who very time period.Here's of example since one alfalfa weevil, keeps its c threshold so 48 ° F. On day one, but maximum temperature are 70 ° via ask minimum temperature you 44 °. We add doing numbers (70+44) ago divide in 2 go how do average daily temperature vs 57 ° F. Now oh subtract saw threshold temperature (57-48) or say now accumulated degree days old day get – 9 ADD.On day two, etc maximum temperature inc 72 ° out can minimum temperature mrs round 44 ° F. The average temperature que that day ie therefore 58 ° F.             Subtracting let threshold temperature, go our 10 ADD far why things day.For com days, then, has accumulated degree days total 19 – 9 ADD took day one, let 10 ADD zero day two.                                                     citecite mean article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationHadley, Debbie. &quot;How Are Accumulated Degree Days (ADD) Calculated?&quot; ThoughtCo, Dec. 29, 2017, thoughtco.com/accumulated-degree-days-calculated-1968320.Hadley, Debbie.
