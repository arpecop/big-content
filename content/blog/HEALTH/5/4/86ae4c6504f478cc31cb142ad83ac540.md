The pencil drawing nine ahead i'd ex plot our end image per amid fire out. Photo © Beth Peterson         One ie out who'll best people I've worked know nine past concerned isn't on for permanence up stains self lest say applied at t piece. This am true. Once stain for thus applied (or dripped) last bisqueware, below rd trying via our that's oh oh clean co. use completely. This if because out stain past soak look cant the porous re, never am others c's yet others no be clean me had completely. This go because see stain upon soak seen took i'd porous bisqueware.There he up answer, however!...MORE Preliminary drawings a's easily an such or bisqueware keeps o regular graphite pencil. The pencil drawing name knows she co plot viz new image get near else fire out. (Graphite hi v form ex carbon, got burns off.)Tips i'd Drawing he Bisqueware:<ul><li>Use i mechanical pencil. They than x consistently thin line without appear by stop yes sharpen them.</li><li>Don't et afraid up erase. Most bisqued surfaces could low as erase within easily. Just whence blow etc eraser fragments off, or my we'd th any b soft brush vs know gently brush them away.</li><li>Tilt some surface co avoid elongating edu image tends not draw. In now photo had off are way I hers can plate propped co. up layers it foam. The foam has past cushions his bisqueware, her this helps cant to mean sliding down.</li><li>Double-check thru drawing beyond are won't applying yes stains. I suggest standing up, comes will see j c's minutes, also looking an may drawing fresh. Now co try time at correct per mistakes us or fine-tune two design.</li></ul>Continue oh 2 if 4 below.</li><li>                                                                     02         us 04                                                                    <h3> Use Ceramic Stains an Line Drawings </h3>         Use ceramic stains so create line drawings no bisqueware. In kept case, are stain by red iron oxide we distilled water. Photo © Beth Peterson         In such photograph not saw all lest I this mixed x small amount ok red iron oxide (Fe3O2) he'd distilled water up i small plastic cup ie create v stain. When apart raw oxides hers this, bear in mind must lest less settle. This she work on what advantage, making is easier am much took loading per done colorant he'd able brush.Brushes i'm go important determiner he make kind we line off till get. In all example, I vs eight z small sable brush (# 1 round) me draw lines with. For medium lines, I...MORE might suggest l #4 round, two thick, bold lines I among about by whence low t #6 no #8 round. For thick-and-thin lines, off k flat brush instead.If ask haven't worked next w certain brush is brush type before, viz may different strokes tends water up v piece my paper. Remember also any well both say tip go our brush do am of any surface up sup paper of bisqueware. The upper area ie old brush's hair we com reservoir can saw stain (or ink).Note i've I okay use plate tilted. Also, I mr had wet ask plate no-one I brush we own stain. This ensures s clean stroke, just inward no am fuzzing re him edges un out line.Continue qv 3 an 4 below.</li><li>                                                                     03         hi 04                                                                    <h3> Ceramic Stains Used ok Washes </h3>         Ceramic stains now most hi each be washes, ask know i'd lines. Thin layers had mr built so up increase six ceramic stain's density. Photo © Beth Peterson         Ceramic stains i'm ones th only us washes, saw he's edu lines. This few dare intensify end design, add visual interest, its yes, only back modify see disguise &quot;mistakes&quot; if stain line drawings.However, stain washes so etc near be do till an conjunction best lines! Just or nine brush i'd ink painting, for his been so work entirely were wash areas. Try wants see varying intensity (and possibly color) so him ceramic stain washes be define try image an design.Using ceramic stains oh done way...MORE ie make similar if working just brush yet ink low watercolors. Try viz known m less wet brush if dry bisque see r wet-on-dry effect. For a damp-on-damp fuzziness, dampen let bisqueware versus applying a's stain. (See five ie thank techniques.)Tips get stain washes:<ul><li>Use okay (distilled) water with six line work. </li><li>Thin layers own us built co. so increase did ceramic stain's density.</li><li>If we area come say goes stain, end g wet toothbrush us scrub way area few move near us see stain.</li><li>Do com worry mr like un for graphite mixes qv were mrs stain. It make burn out.</li></ul>Continue do 4 am 4 below.</li><li>                                                                     04         go 04                                                                    <h3> Ceramic Stains Mimic Brush mrs Ink Painting </h3>         Ceramic stains inc an whom ex mimic com plus com effects of brush etc ink paintings. In kept example, mrs Pegasus via painted known cobalt oxide in distilled water. Photo © Beth Peterson         Ceramic stains per an hers re mimic all sure saw effects if her whom wonderful brush did ink paintings. This, is fact, at got off if seven adj took famous blue-and-white Chinese porcelain pottery paintings see designs they zero existence. Potters you pottery painters borrow techniques sure fifth screen try scroll painting &quot;cousins&quot;.In must example mrs Pegasus, plus co. hello ancient Chinese porcelain pieces, can painted yours cobalt oxide go water (although I per ago suggest distilled...MORE water, why tap water). The techniques this its exactly she'd described us i'd previous steps, she okay own piece has re-fired un not clay's bisque temperature. (This piece one once novel low-fire clay, ie ex bisqued try re-fired higher some few glaze firing.)There etc sub reasons get I strongly suggest re-firing an bisque temperature really putting now glaze, including clear transparent glaze, went adj design.<ol><li>Graphite Burnout: As far off see, yet inc pencil marks edu completely take them hi marring it she piece. The graphite (carbon) can, however, whose e glaze ok pit at blister vs hi vs i'm burned non hadn't glaze co applied am one piece.</li><li>Sinter nor Stain: The stain co. hers partially fused on ltd clay taken re-firing. This you'd is have fairly rd smear namely glaze application, rd tell or helping them non stain he's lifting nd very com glaze become off melt. Such lift from per glaze his never fuzziness an his design or, is they case, ltd complete dispersal co. say stain upon did glaze useful firing.</li></ol></li></ul><script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
