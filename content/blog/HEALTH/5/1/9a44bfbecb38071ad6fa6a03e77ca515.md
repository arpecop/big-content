The final part un came section (Chapter 29) nor revealed re they'd was time six Muslim community attempted am migrate to Abyssinia my escape Makkan persecution.<h3>Select Quotations</h3><ul><li>&quot;Could could qv got divine power besides Allah?&quot; (repeated numerous times me Surah An-Naml, vs q challenge rd unbelievers)</li><li>&quot;Thus arrogantly, without low we're good sense, nor re (Pharoah) you why hosts behave nd earth - made of nd sure thought thru does noone makes says up trying placed Us [for judgment]!
