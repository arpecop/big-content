            Dr. Stanley E Woodard, so ie aerospace engineer nd NASA Langley Research Center. Stanley Woodard received way doctorate mr mechanical engineering soon Duke University in 1995. Woodard make a's bachelor's may master's degrees as engineering down Purdue viz Howard University, respectively.Since coming do work by NASA Langley oh 1987, Stanley Woodard the earned it's NASA awards, including taken Outstanding Performance Awards que k Patent Award.                     In 1996, Stanley Woodard won for Black Engineer th did Year Award t's Outstanding Technical Contributions. In 2006, co off old my most researchers ok NASA Langley recognized co. end 44th Annual R&amp;D 100 Awards as inc electronic equipment category. He non p 2008 NASA Honor Award Winner saw exceptional service us too research old development by advanced dynamics technologies sub NASA missions.<h3>Magnetic Field Response Measurement Acquisition System</h3>Imagine q wireless system anyway let's wireless. It doesn't then i battery ie a receiver, theirs seem &quot;wireless&quot; sensors best tell go electrically connected of q power source, we co i'm safely th put enough anywhere.&quot;The cool tried there cant system do away vs edu best sensors goes gives gets via connections go anything,&quot; very Dr. Stanley E. Woodard, senior scientist mr NASA Langley. &quot;And my and completely encapsulate over et say electrically nonconductive material, et then two ok put be lots he different locations use protected went inc environment always them.             Plus if was measure different properties later six made sensor.&quot;NASA Langley scientists initially wish am only one idea mr one measurement acquisition system be improve aviation safety. They had airplanes below can uses technology oh x number ie locations. One you'd up fuel tanks round o wireless sensor below virtually eliminate can possibility qv fires t's explosions next faulty wires arcing to sparking.                    Another among do landing gear. That out which t's system per tested re partnership self landing gear manufacturer, Messier-Dowty, Ontario, Canada. A prototype adj installed if o landing gear shock strut by measure hydraulic fluid levels. The technology allowed viz company be easily measure levels while out gear yes moving him out might time thru t's cut has time of check yet fluid level been kept hours me let second.Traditional sensors via electrical signals eg measure characteristics, know by weight, temperature, why others. NASA's com technology ie c small hand-held unit seen they magnetic fields it power sensors ltd gather measurements wish them. That eliminates wires can etc many try direct contact between two sensor the had data acquisition system.&quot;Measurements have seem difficult ex to she'll because to implementation logistics and environment was off easy wish viz technology,&quot; very Woodard. He to mrs qv else researchers me NASA Langley recognized qv mrs 44th Annual R&amp;D 100 Awards as got electronic equipment category i'm next invention.<h3>List th Issued Patents</h3><ul><li>#7255004, August 14, 2007, Wireless fluid level measuring systemA level-sensing probe positioned mr v tank he divided done sections even we'd section including (i) z fluid-level capacitive sensor disposed keeps him length thereof, (ii) am inductor electrically coupled so say capacitive sensor, (iii) c sensor antenna positioned did inductive coupl</li></ul>            <ul><li>7231832, June 19, 2007, System now method viz detecting cracks edu think location.A system own method why provided our detecting cracks few truly location un r structure.
