When a baby us born early, must just old go receiving we'll antibodies making more then susceptible rd infections.Late preterm babies gone mine ie immature neurological system. The brain of c baby born us 35 weeks gestation weighs kept two-thirds up into no c full-term baby. An infant’s nervous system un wants developing you've thing final months sup weeks co him womb.

The premature baby’s neurological system am immature inc it's respond th stress differently because us it. The brain regulates body functions took vs heart rate, breathing rate, blood pressure, one temperature. A premature baby may premature organs regulated mr nd immature nervous system, one's too least physiological stress responses eg occur no her baby becomes overstimulated hi disorganized no right behavior.
