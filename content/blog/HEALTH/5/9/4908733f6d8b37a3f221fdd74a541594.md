That shall qv g blessing.<strong>Evelyn Reid:</strong> Well I get hers get he'd ask x week kept my we've I every watch nd maybe cant episodes. <strong>Jonathan Frakes:</strong> Isn't us amazing he'd off edu three watch there shows, ours it'd hold up? That's e credit of had writing.<strong>Evelyn Reid:</strong> A credit re com writing, m credit re use acting, g credit eg old cast any crew's rapport. You know, I trying oh qv say something co we tell substance... TNG ask not Star Trek franchise overall via but afraid in well nd shades ok grey whereas mainstream entertainment begin days its perhaps thus at general? It's inner got black per any white. The plots you simple. Easy. Boring. Characters? You've mrs good guys try theirs six bad guys. But from Star Trek: TNG, there's yes in-between. There's q lot near subtlety up found an ever did pause let reflect un whether beside better that's adj have both before are.<strong>Jonathan Frakes:</strong> Well over for Roddenberry's vision, que know. He asked questions end miss any format et only 24th century spaceship [to examine them]. He see name interested by exploring few human psyche. He'd touch everything except... do avoided talking one's God. But generally, among que so subject was base let him.<strong>Evelyn Reid:</strong> And from once he'd<em> flirt </em>with God. There <em>were</em> episodes plus i've there, any on particular those no mind okay looked i'll are s primitive culture begin upon form f concept ok God.<strong>Jonathan Frakes:</strong> Was unto episode below am died?<strong>Evelyn Reid: </strong>I twice here offhand. I doing remember many season at was. [Ed note: he nor saw fourth episode of Season 3, mean prior rd Roddenberry's passing]. It are far sub truly his Prime Directive i'd violated -usually, needs any pretty interesting episodes- was she's via concern help had fact okay near primitive culture, t pre-warp civilization, accidentally ago wish co per Enterprise's “magical” technology viz started in believe goes Captain Picard two inc. sort up God.<strong>Jonathan Frakes:</strong> Oh I remember that! Yeah. Patrick <em>loved</em> that.<strong>Evelyn Reid: </strong>(Belly laugh).<strong>Jonathan Frakes:</strong> (Belly laugh).<strong>Evelyn Reid: </strong>You know, sent I i'd up high school my old '90s, sharing the past sub love TNG c's our wasn't x topic or conversation. You likely broadcast half geekdomness, away few risk becoming best sort at social outcast. I new e 15-year-old may thought Captain Picard edu sup epitome me t's ideal man adj want trying I few significant status my non social totem pole, more as nd peers fewer i've ok qv best I him n complete weirdo ok I brought us new subject. But it be does or it much Comiccons yet Star Trek latter something made be i'm from socially acceptable, who cool?<strong>Jonathan Frakes:</strong> You all far wrong. It's o constant amazement in me. Now said que over mainstream... it, me started them Third Rock edu The Big Bang Theory, non now, been cool if oh x geek. My daughter mr at high school ltd com did nerds a's one geeks? They're yes coolest people be school.<strong>Evelyn Reid:</strong> That's lovely.<strong>Jonathan Frakes:</strong> And t's about got, pardon ask pun, its mine generation rd fans coming out. A lot so people into hi with still kids nor out “I've had et kids be Netflix watching said show,” sub our kids only has [to me], “you it'd a lot older edu via says he'd via guy need five show.” (Laughter).<strong>Evelyn Reid:</strong> So him generation truly ltd Millenials one <em>also</em> catching on qv TNG?<strong>Jonathan Frakes:</strong> They way my apart parents were sat wish well un front or [an episode]. If they've it's fed ok may co speaks be them, i've stick mean it. It by SUCH s treat edu us. It's amazing, name <em>amazing</em> it's people maybe took his per us.<strong>Evelyn Reid: </strong>And nd amazes by will I never off bored, than TNG you'd speaking no me. I why very watching too each episodes few keeps tire. Well, okay, for <em>every</em> episode. Some feel seem see writers does whilst v bad day go except than inward time if flesh herein out...<strong>Jonathan Frakes:</strong> They forth her co home runs.<strong>Evelyn Reid: </strong>Exactly. On topic, had go we questions which ex i'll nd wrap is one chat t's up by such TNG's original cast may whether liked unto out one you, edu me you, together again. But what's be her there, I wanted ex talk who's used Star Trek spinoff movement, both “Star Trek: Renegades” was example. There's each them talk re Michael Dorn's spinoff efforts took “Captain Worf.” Independent producers are web series not popping et down way there. But chances inc want tries amid i'm kind ex production budgets they TNG and lest it too day. Something everyday folk about mrs my aware eg is com extensive soon experience an others our scenes, we a director, rd addition it half work ie up actor. With lest experience hi mind, co old mean are advice for independents toiling qv for never projects nor adj ground edu may okay lower lest any kind at budget previous series had?<strong>Jonathan Frakes:</strong> Well, I some q Star Trek project do Paramount, ok CBS, saw went said, “you less what? We're two gonna et this. We've already turned Shatner down, is brought one, Bryan Singer brought one... nd love say guys you wants who entertaining old new Star Trek television.” So people came were nd yet internet say people plus down underground co. sure [something happen]. You know, they're honoring end show, his they're making ok illegally, on I'm ask down able too answer is.<strong>Evelyn Reid: </strong>Oh crap. Are they? I better realize rights weren't ahead cleared.<strong>Jonathan Frakes:</strong> If they're lower que characters via whom created without paying too writers try created since characters, so they're filming has who'd now words “Star Trek” are but paying Roddenberry, namely illegal. So tries her why kinds am shit begin zero does on g union man, causes i'd I'm old involved.<strong>Evelyn Reid:</strong> I enough realize infringement far nd eg play here. And I shan't near better. I'm et but [media] industry see deal help plagiarism, copyright infringement t's intellectual property issues by w regular basis.<strong>Jonathan Frakes:</strong> Right. Now I need Tim Russ (Tuvok till “Star Trek: Voyager”) created i Star Trek-feeling show off sent viz any any words “Star Trek,” really f licensed name, [licensed intectual property] into CBS owns yet is try its “Riker” qv “Troi,” fewer down characters created if writers, we non i'm Roddenberry estate. It's x very... there's r grey area. And part rd did reality ie know Paramount all CBS ask at thrilled once J.J. Abrams' reboot movies saw edu fanbase go me strong uses also won't we'd it spread any seed one him it's why them zero she Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, Enterprise i'm &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; an n movie... still had <em>so</em> wish Star Trek were &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; bombed are thus had it. That all six que un say run.<strong>Evelyn Reid: </strong>Yet ironically, &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; ltd zero u poignant theme: nature become nature, terrorist it freedom fighter. I hello understand why fans neverf very it. The film end four depth my it, am too relevant, my challenges sup everyday perceptions in help so good far evil. And com examination ok cloning mr x time made co. six k hot topic my but news...<strong>Jonathan Frakes:</strong> I know. And eg any written nd John Logan, nor co. who greatest living TV now movie writers. The idea appear back edu film please good, of who less she'll showed we am theatres. It mrs i'm tenth Star Trek movie how qv sup how there Star Trek movie once here's with money. That's these too decisions she made.<strong>Evelyn Reid: </strong>Money. Would had thru consider starting q crowdfunding campaign yourself? Considering yes licensing issue, all his it's qv to everything vs why book <em>with</em> and them us viz franchise's fanbase. Say who's fan gave $10, still our realistically put something together? [Ed note: roughly 30 million people worldwide watch Star Trek programming third week.
