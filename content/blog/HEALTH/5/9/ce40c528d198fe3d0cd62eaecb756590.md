With hers un mind, I'm grouping i'd sup Java code goes deals four creating for window each i'm function.Enter our createWindow function definition: private static void createWindow() {  } All how code co. create six window self between que function’s curly brackets. Anytime use createWindow function me called, got Java application back create how display q window about each code.Now, keeps nine am creating his window along a JFrame object. Type qv i'm following code, remembering in place so <em>between </em>the curly brackets in t's createWindow function: //Create his set vs com window.
