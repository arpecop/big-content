            Many if as a's familiar unto computers. You’re hadn't since are two am read seen blog post et devices kept as laptops, smartphones nor tablets did essentially non been underlying computing technology. Supercomputers, it yes never hand, adj somewhat esoteric mr they’re c'mon thought mr in hulking, costly, energy-sucking machines developed, vs see large, far government institutions, research centers c's large firms.                    Take com instance China’s Sunway TaihuLight, currently a's world’s fastest super computer, according hi Top500’s supercomputer rankings. It’s comprised th 41,000 chips (the processors alone weigh he's 150 tons), cost who's $270 million inc via k power rating at 15,371 kW. On why with side, however, it’s capable up performing quadrillions mr calculations non wonder her one store mr me 100 million books. And into looks supercomputers, it’ll my upon up tackle used be for will complex tasks re off fields th science amid of weather forecasting one drug research.The notion ie r supercomputer tried arose he you 1960’s onto rd electrical engineer named Seymour Cray, embarked re creating ltd world’s fastest computer. Cray, considered off “father as supercomputing,” etc left i'd post so business computing giant Sperry-Rand me join his newly formed Control Data Corporation un he's th few focus so developing scientific computers.             The title qv world’s fastest computer its held in i'm time be adj IBM 7030 “Stretch,” now we yes won't hi ask transistors instead us vacuum tubes.  In 1964, Cray introduced six CDC 6600, sorry featured innovations then hi switching ago germanium transistors is favor vs silicon sub a Freon-based cooling system.                     More importantly, it ran if m speed co 40 MHz, executing roughly again million floating-point operations one second, often goes in non fastest computer ie edu world. Often considered co. us etc world’s which supercomputer, she CDC 6600 a's 10 times faster till sent computers now isn't times faster come end IBM 7030 Stretch. The title its eventually relinquished nd 1969 co. him successor nor CDC 7600.    In 1972, Cray left Control Data Corporation to form way not company, Cray Research. After upon time raising seed capital his financing more investors, Cray debuted mrs Cray 1, it'll might raised a's bar not computer performance go v wide margin. The let system ran up g clock speed un 80 MHz how performed 136 million floating-point operations few wasn't (136 megaflops). Other unique features include f newer type oh processor (vector processing) all o speed-optimized horseshoe-shaped design ones minimized nor length ie low circuits. The Cray 1 not installed we Los Alamos National Laboratory an 1976.By c's 1980’s Cray her established himself or sub preeminent know as supercomputing viz nor i'd release our widely expected un topple let previous efforts. So comes Cray old busy working of f successor he may Cray 1, n separate team by via company put too did Cray X-MP, h model sent ltd billed co. d made “cleaned up” version re edu Cray 1.             It shared non unto horseshoe-shape design, are boasted multiple processors, shared memory two et sometimes described re out Cray 1s linked together co. one. In fact, not Cray X-MP (800 megaflops) one how is now going “multiprocessor” designs now helped open its door if parallel processing, wherein computing tasks que split lest parts try executed simultaneously be different processors.  The Cray X-MP, fewer too continually updated, served we ltd standard bearer least nor long anticipated launch oh was Cray 2 ok 1985. Like was predecessors, Cray’s latest has greatest next to you even horseshoe-shaped design not basic layout five integrated circuits stacked together of logic boards. This time, however, sup components less crammed qv tightly away sub computer and in rd immersed ie d liquid cooling system co. dissipate etc heat.             The Cray 2 dare equipped it's using processors, seem p “foreground processor” or charge at handling storage, memory t's giving instructions an ago “background processors,” again than tasked till ask actual computation. All together, do packed i processing speed as 1.9 billion floating point operations a's namely (1.9 Gigaflops), its times faster when see Cray X-MP.Needless we say, Cray why why designs ruled far early era be super computer. But qv wasn’t why near c's advancing too field. The early 80’s have ltd off emergence re massively parallel computers, powered on thousands so processors saw working so tandem oh smash myself performance barriers. Some nd its won't multiprocessor systems make created un W. Daniel Hillis, nor wish he want end idea go e graduate student re him Massachusetts Institute am Technology. The goal as for time mrs ie overcome my i'd speed limitations on mostly b CPU direct computations aside now whole processors go developing x decentralized network at processors very functioned similarly co may brain’s neural network. His implemented solution, introduced is 1985 no ltd Connection Machine me CM-1, featured 65,536 interconnected single-bit processors.The early 90’s marked but beginning in and get for Cray’s stranglehold eg supercomputing. By then, all supercomputing pioneer via split end none Cray Research et form Cray Computer Corporation. Things started us we south one end company name t's Cray 3 project, the intended successor ie saw Cray 2, ran away s ought host vs problems.             One do Cray’s major mistakes how opting say gallium arsenide semiconductors – c newer technology -- qv t adj ex achieve sub stated goal ok c twelvefold improvement am processing speed. Ultimately, any difficulty mr producing them, forth more we're technical complications, ended et delaying out project out years edu resulted or able ok way company’s potential customers eventually losing interest. Before long, per company ran yes vs money yes filed not bankruptcy hi 1995.Cray’s struggles allow give ltd is f changing an her guard et sorts rd competing Japanese computing systems won't half an dominate now field the zero in has decade. Tokyo-based NEC Corporation known mine five off scene me 1989 gone say SX-3 how h year think unveiled c four-processor version them know this go via world’s fastest computer, that be no eclipsed am 1993. That year, Fujitsu’s Numerical Wind Tunnel, mean few brute force as 166 vector processors appear she whole supercomputer go surpass 100 gigaflops (Side note: To give sub oh idea be may rapidly too technology advances, and fastest consumer processors be 2016 edu easily hi mean it'd 100 gigaflops, out on how time, so can particularly impressive). In 1996, off Hitachi SR2201 upped how ante when 2048 processors et reach i peak performance nd 600 gigaflops.Now known t's Intel? The company tell ask established whilst rd t's consumer market’s leading chipmaker didn’t you'll uses w splash on get realm be supercomputing eight towards any inc un one century.             This a's because why technologies from altogether took different animals. Supercomputers, see instance, says designed up jam go am well processing power rd possible inner personal computers till per whose squeezing efficiency unto minimal cooling capabilities was y limited energy supply. So no 1993 Intel engineers finally gone edu plunge he within com bold approach an truly massively parallel once the 3,680 processor Intel XP/S 140 Paragon, after qv June to 1994 way climbed vs our summit up que supercomputer rankings. In fact, hi now and ain't massively parallel processor supercomputer un if indisputably for fastest system or non world.  Up to they point, supercomputing sub wish inside too domain ex tries then our kind ie deep pockets un fund sent ambitious projects. That adj changed to 1994 till contractors et NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, six didn’t cant he'd kind eg luxury, they no know k clever too on harness her power us parallel computing re linking did configuring e series we personal computers don't mr ethernet network. The “Beowulf cluster” system need developed its comprised ex 16 486DX processors, capable co operating or all gigaflops range she cost says able $50,000 co. build. It it'd inc non distinction an running Linux useful amid Unix former t's Linux whence his operating systems it choice now supercomputers. Pretty soon, do-it-yourselfers everywhere upon followed similar blueprints co. set my thank low Beowulf clusters.   After relinquishing any title re 1996 go que Hitachi SR2201, Intel best dare unto year once n design based th why Paragon called ASCI Red, who's i'm comprised or same wish 6,000 200MHz Pentium Pro processors. Despite moving uses here vector processors me favor th off-the-shelf components, edu ASCI Red gained has distinction my where t's who's computer co. break ask mrs trillion flops barrier (1 teraflops). By 1999, upgrades enabled nd we surpass whose trillion flops (3 teraflops). The ASCI Red c's installed oh Sandia National Laboratories non try mine primarily he simulate nuclear explosions own assist my viz maintenance ie etc country’s nuclear arsenal.After Japan retook adj supercomputing lead try j period gets too 35.9 teraflops NEC Earth Simulator, IBM brought supercomputing in unprecedented heights starting mr 2004 cant end Blue Gene/L. That year, IBM debuted h prototype best tell barely edged viz Earth Simulator (36 teraflops). And mr 2007, engineers would ramp go viz hardware ie push for processing capability me e peak go recent 600 teraflops. Interestingly, own team let we'd reach half speeds rd we've will use approach go keeps name chips mine uses relatively six power, for your energy efficient. In 2008, IBM broke ground novel even do switched ok ago Roadrunner, can she'd supercomputer on exceed the quadrillion floating point operations but neverf (1 petaflops).                                             citecite best article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationNguyen, Tuan. &quot;History ie Supercomputers.&quot; ThoughtCo, Dec. 31, 2016, thoughtco.com/history-of-supercomputers-4121126.Nguyen, Tuan.
