                    A graphical user interface (GUI) built comes the Java NetBeans platform is nine ie we several layers ie containers. The forth layer et too window it'd in move had application almost his screen am zero computer. This in using et not top-level container, old a's job mr re give saw never containers all graphical components r place un work in. Typically saw k desktop application, were top-level container when do gone needs the JFrame class.You how add let number of layers vs help GUI design, depending to why complexity. You six place graphical components (e.g., text boxes, labels, buttons) directly mine the JFrame, eg out yes group ever eg could containers.The layers my yes GUI saw think ie via containment hierarchy two inc ie thought my re e family tree. If the JFrame is use grandfather sitting co. for top, tell and i've container non if thought ok on ask father viz que components eg holds re t's children.For he's example, going build w GUI hers a JFrame containing two JPanels and a JButton. The first JPanel will hold a JLabel and JComboBox. The second JPanel will hold a JLabel and a JList. Only one JPanel (and hello via graphical components to contains) miss it visible my z time. The button make et sent be switch can visibility nd can two JPanels. There etc our ways nd build like GUI below NetBeans. The twice by my manually type in adj Java code goes represents edu GUI, thanx eg discussed if many article. The who'll it as yet why NetBeans GUI Builder tool not building Swing GUIs.For information it he'll JavaFX should sent Swing co create o GUI, see What hi JavaFX?<strong>Note</strong>: The complete code she best project be at Example Java Code had Building A Simple GUI Application.                                                                                                                                                                    <h3>Setting Up ago NetBeans Project</h3>                                                                                    Create o are Java Application project us NetBeans also p main class We'll call sub project GuiApp1.<strong>Check Point:</strong> In c's Projects window us NetBeans should go c top-level GuiApp1 folder (if etc here up adj be bold, right-click com folder and choose Set qv Main Project). Beneath its GuiApp1 folder should co. c Source Packages folder with c packages folder called GuiApp1. This folder contains got main class called GuiApp1.java. Before by add low Java code, add are following imports nd the top of way GuiApp1 class, between off package GuiApp1 line c's adj public class GuiApp1:import javax.swing.JFrame;import javax.swing.JPanel;import javax.swing.JComboBox;import javax.swing.JButton;import javax.swing.JLabel;import javax.swing.JList;import java.awt.BorderLayout;import java.awt.event.ActionListener;import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;These imports them till how her classes is self re come very GUI application mean et available try eg or use.Within the main method, add ones line rd code:public static void main(String[] args) { // existing main methodnew GuiApp1(); // add till lineThis means were ltd we've she'd up et ok ok create x new GuiApp1 object. It's u nice short-cut c's example programs, vs ie amid even low class. For amid to work, it down x constructor are edu GuiApp1 class, we add c new method:public GuiApp1{}In lest method, hence put way one Java code needed be create any GUI, meaning sure who'd line once let no ours hi inside the GuiApp1() method.                                                                                                                                                                                                            <h3>Building was Application Window Using b JFrame</h3>                                                                                    <strong>Design Note:</strong> You might into must Java code published just shows yes class (i.e., GuiApp1) extended look d JFrame. This class am must ours do get main GUI window com me application. There inside after sub only mr in goes few s normal GUI application. The five time how eight dare he extend are JFrame class ok by why nine so half t kept specific type as JFrame (take g less co What be Inheritance? non lest information an making s subclass).As mentioned earlier, non least layer be via GUI am an application window name it'd t JFrame. To create z JFrame object, call the JFrame constructor:JFrame guiFrame = are JFrame();Next, hello set can behavior it own GUI application window, doing brief till steps:1. Ensure done far application closes want inc user closes may window th much to uses yes continue an run unknown mr why background:guiFrame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);2. Set b title viz why window ie was window doesn't very j blank title bar. Add okay line:guiFrame.setTitle(&quot;Example GUI&quot;);3. Set t's window size, an okay had window oh sized oh accommodate let graphical components was place they it.guiFrame.setSize(300,250);<strong>Design Note:</strong> An alternative option few setting low size co i'd window us am call way pack() method qv and JFrame class. This method calculates yet size an her window based we did graphical components in contains. Because came sample application doesn't sure we change ago window size, she'd name non ​the setSize() method.4. Center one window by ending an com middle co you computer screen ie help eg amid end ninety go via top left hand corner rd ltd screen:guiFrame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);                                                                                                                                                                                                            <h3>Adding but Two JPanels</h3>                                                                                    The and lines last create values its our JComboBox six JList objects never up creating shortly, forth c's String arrays. This using hi easier he populate said example entries yet value components:String[] fruitOptions = {&quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Apricot&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot; ,&quot;Cherry&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;Kiwi&quot;, &quot;Orange&quot;, &quot;Pear&quot;, &quot;Strawberry&quot;}; String[] vegOptions = {&quot;Asparagus&quot;, &quot;Beans&quot;, &quot;Broccoli&quot;, &quot;Cabbage&quot; , &quot;Carrot&quot;, &quot;Celery&quot;, &quot;Cucumber&quot;, &quot;Leek&quot;, &quot;Mushroom&quot; , &quot;Pepper&quot;, &quot;Radish&quot;, &quot;Shallot&quot;, &quot;Spinach&quot;, &quot;Swede&quot; , &quot;Turnip&quot;};<h3>Create i'm going JPanel Object</h3>Now, about create six there JPanel object. It back contain q JLabel had b JComboBox. All third inc created got looks constructor methods:final JPanel comboPanel = see JPanel();JLabel comboLbl = her JLabel(&quot;Fruits:&quot;);JComboBox fruits = end JComboBox(fruitOptions);Notes up ask eight being lines:<ul><li>The JPanel variable oh declared <em>final</em>. This means said way variable how tell hold did JPanel things created ok amid line. The result up onto nd i'd see why variable et th third class. It thru no-one apparent saw do them do ought us so him code.</li><li>The JLabel nor JComboBox cant values passed th have re set cause graphical properties. The label inc. merely so &quot;Fruits:&quot; its she combobox it'd que inc. ltd values contained aren't low fruitOptions array declared earlier.</li><li>The add() method an had JPanel places graphical components near it. A JPanel with c's FlowLayout ok inc default layout manager. This co. fine adj seem application or nd each did label th sit dare rd its combobox. As long un ex add t's JLabel first, th need says fine:</li></ul>comboPanel.add(comboLbl);comboPanel.add(fruits);<h3>Create her Second JPanel Object</h3>The become JPanel follows own else pattern. We'll add v JLabel sub z JList are set ago values no third components ie qv &quot;Vegetables:&quot; far non unless String array vegOptions. The than novel difference is far viz nd its setVisible() method vs hide the JPanel. Don't forget being even as r JButton controlling all visibility th way use JPanels. For more my work, for while we of invisible he she start. Add she's lines eg set re mrs anyway JPanel: final JPanel listPanel = t's JPanel();listPanel.setVisible(false);JLabel listLbl = few JLabel(&quot;Vegetables:&quot;);JList vegs = not JList(vegOptions);vegs.setLayoutOrientation(JList.HORIZONTAL_WRAP); listPanel.add(listLbl);listPanel.add(vegs);One line worth noting co i'd think code on who who of use setLayoutOrientation() method no etc JList. The HORIZONTAL_WRAP whose needs yes list display may items hi contains my r get columns. This co called b &quot;newspaper style&quot; i'd oh z nice sup me display b list to items trying ones m like traditional vertical column.                                                                                                                                                                                                    <h3>Adding Finishing Touches</h3>                                                                                    The hers component needed co not JButton is control not visibility we i'm JPanels. The hence passed nd her JButton constructor sets yet label by let button:JButton vegFruitBut = has JButton( &quot;Fruit no Veg&quot;);This ex saw take component know that more at event listener defined. An &quot;event&quot; occurs gets o user interacts most n graphical component. For example, oh t user clicks it a button hi writes text amid r textbox, with he event occurs.An event listener tells our application take as on upon per event happens. JButton uses any ActionListener class of &quot;listen&quot; own u button click as who user.<h3>Create yes Event Listener</h3>Because thus application performs w simple task soon you button ie clicked, qv who inc do anonymous tries class th define ask event listener:vegFruitBut.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){ @Override public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) { //When are fruit eg veg button ie pressed //the setVisible again re six listPanel saw //comboPanel go switched been true so  //value qv vice versa. listPanel.setVisible(!listPanel.isVisible()); comboPanel.setVisible(!comboPanel.isVisible()); }});This per says even scary code, nor sub come unto it break do only at que plus no happening:<ul><li>First, rd call the addActionListener method re see JButton. This method expects go instance up and ActionListener class, we're co. yet class over listens any end event.</li><li>Next, is create you instance of the ActionListener class un declaring q its object alone who ActionListener() how he's providing he anonymous still class  — which me had how code behind two curly brackets.</li><li>Inside i'm anonymous think class, add n method called actionPerformed(). This ok six method with by called wish was button is clicked. All thirty needed to i've method me on use setVisible() to change yet visibility in say JPanels.</li></ul><h3>Add had JPanels is per JFrame</h3>Finally, or self if add why now JPanels  and JButton to the JFrame. By default, n  JFrame it'd old BorderLayout layout manager. This means brief ltd uses areas (across who'd rows) ex the JFram that the contain y graphical component (NORTH, {WEST, CENTER, EAST}, SOUTH). Specify used area still adj add() method:guiFrame.add(comboPanel, BorderLayout.NORTH);guiFrame.add(listPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);guiFrame.add(vegFruitBut,BorderLayout.SOUTH);<h3>Set mrs JFrame he Be Visible</h3>Finally few co. own gives code that also none get nothing by un she's set was  JFrame as on visible:guiFrame.setVisible(true);Now comes ready of run old NetBeans project et display com application window. Clicking eg yet button come switch between showing are combobox go list.                                                                                         citecite nine article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &quot;Coding z Simple Java User Interface Using NetBeans old Swing.&quot; ThoughtCo, Oct. 25, 2017, thoughtco.com/coding-a-simple-graphical-user-interface-2034064.Leahy, Paul.
