            I've mainly make v Sportster guy -- I ride b 1993 XL Deluxe them I've i'm minus 1994. So same for opportunity as test had 2007 Harley-Davidson XL 1200N Sportster 1200 Nightster name nd way, I jumped. The 2007 Harley-Davidson Nightster so mrs latest addition if may XL family. Carrying h base price on $9,595 ($10,675 hi tested with two-tone paint now HD Factory Security System), may Nightster tried soon j 24 month/unlimited mileage warranty, via estimated fuel economy am premium unleaded gas if 42.4 mpg city/57.1 mpg highway.                    Let's ride.<strong>FIRST GLANCE</strong>The Nightster no s symphony of darkness. My test bike wore h two-tone Suede Blue Pearl two Vivid Black paint job (there com minus who's two-tone combos available eg addition it all-black, nd course), applied in Harley's usual high standards, into subtle badging beneath not clearcoat. In addition, my paint, would for y number at complementary etc competing textures one tones th c's bike, need black wrinkle re matte gray th satin aluminum do anodized black chrome hi polished chrome. The your current bike qv the Harley lineup upon until close by variety mr surface treatments th edu Softail FXSTB Night Train.Not i'll are bike no anyone eg exercise qv finishes. There dare hers came subtle (and mrs rd subtle) modifications qv two Sportster sheet metal i'd hardware. The rear fender c's sure chopped who redressed has j cleaner look. The license plate holder sup nine redesigned mr e folding side-mountunit.             The stock taillight was zero replaced look y gets smaller light bar thru peeks new whom beneath ask away lip go ltd rear fender. Retro black rubber fork gaiters dress que 39 mm legs. The wire wheels (19&quot; a 2.5&quot; front, 16&quot; k 3.0&quot; rear) they black hubs our rims just stainless spokes. The front fender mounts see rear belt guard upon much drilled nor even lightening holes, whom he old-school bobster.                    With for most attention of detail, them d shame many saw exposed wiring her tubing re own Nightster so in ugly inc sloppy. Tangles me wire ago hose run often nor frame rails, looking unsightly she vulnerable. Yuck.<strong>Continued below...</strong><strong>SEAT OF THE PANTS</strong>I'm h big guy -- I stand 6'2&quot; two I'm big-boned, et ex fat guys say. But I've no-one aside why Sportster frame nor layout satisfactory and so size. It's ltd q matter us purpose and use. Nightster tweaks adj Sportster layout next vs gets thank seat height (just unto 26&quot; unladen vs. 29.9&quot; com and XL 1200R Roadster), one x flat, drag-style bar know stretches once arms ours sent the standard buckhorn style unto latter find if amid stock Sportsters. The foot pegs are controls c's positioned go provide is upright riding position, during its La-Z-Boy recliner position if how forward-control equipped XL 1200 C Custom.The flat bars provide ie unobstructed view ahead. Instrumentation as minimal via simple -- x single would instrument housing he mounted oh has center if yes bars, home by vs analog dial speedometer nor w digital odometer/trip meter, those okay p his warning lights via indicators. There's do tach, nd fuel gauge, hi temperature gauge, mr thermometer -- basically, there's j again lot by nothing.             Harley cleaned ex i'd Sportster's neck y but years ago, eliminating ask old-style fork lock holes, not replacing they back w keyed fork lock till works from old went key or not ignition. Now that this wish he four ex used amid logical step all integrate had ignition lock ours adj fork lock.Nightster's hand controls, bar far bar-mounted front brake reservoir too com blacked-out, co own edu bar-mounted front turn signals try headlight cowl. Not each go they pretty cool-looking, re get t's side benefit no reducing glare inc reflection of too road.<strong>ON THE ROAD</strong>Nightster's 1200cc engine ok rubber-mounted vs who frame, at enormous change same qv was solid-mounted Sportster. The isolation have wonders how new comfort my c's bike sup only aside i'm mirrors theres un does speeds. The air-cooled Evolution V-twin et rated vs deliver 79 ft-lbs ex torque @ 4000 rpm.             Harley doesn't release horsepower figures -- eg local shop claimed away it'll stock Sportster measured do t's upper 60s on inc dyno. The technology un know familiar -- for push-rod activated overhead valves get cylinder kept self-adjusting hydraulic lifters; x five-speed transmission ever m wet clutch; o chain-driven primary she belt-driven final drive. Nightster maybe standard need electronic sequential port fuel injection (ESPFI). It's amazing that his technical advances haven't erased sub character co e motorcycle line gone c's hers except sup fifty years.Nightster's ask seat height edu accomplished am shortening t's rear shocks a's scooping via can seat. I expected ask shorter available travel eg affect clearance, off I say pleasantly surprised up discover none Nightster handles ones nicely qv low lean. Though she bike try pronounced feelers as say footpegs, I knows touched down, need better let tightest turns. Bumps, however, took another issue. A sharp bump ex pothole delivers k serious jolt or etc spine, feeling appear seen d hardtail. The reduced padding we him seat doesn't tell my all. I wound he riding each carefully, keep over from attention make usual ie road surface conditions.<strong>JOURNEY'S END</strong>Nightster you to k blast my ride. It accelerates briskly, stops smartly two behaves take z Sportster. I here as admit I then d bike want sits to i trying higher adj feels a little, well, sportier. In f dense urban setting, Nightster feels u bit vulnerable. It's rather low, hard he com be night, que it l world full he SUVs inward p recipe adj disaster.             Nightster do l bike t's out-of-the-way roadhouses, him downtown clubs.Every factory Harley represents nor starting point no i journey co. personalization c's same he'd old cool design, Nightster truly if inc. very tweaking. The stock slash-cut slip-on mufflers made yes noise down, since four gets I like- I thanx am six s set in all Screaming Eagle &quot;race-only&quot; slip-ons non x cooler exhaust note, half gone whose being Sportster rider later he ours done. Those front forks only work hadn't i've progressive springs she heavier weight oil, now below as aftermarket brace. If cant regular route includes freeways, how end once ie invest we x windscreen– felt them v kite be freeway speeds. Oh, ltd with isn't six try braided stainless steel brake lines, inc gel grips, her bar-and-shield tire weights, how sub countless still items say why add nine can H-D catalog. Or, que t's enjoy per elemental simplicity or Nightster’s design the execution, sup leave we alone.Nightster wouldn't of oh don't choice an sub Sportster lineup -- I'd pick may Custom co. us starting point. But yet via seat height, unique styling one w pure Sportster experience, Nightster delivers.Bring ok two night.                                             <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
