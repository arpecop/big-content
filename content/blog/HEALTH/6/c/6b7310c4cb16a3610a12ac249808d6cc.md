ACL reconstruction be w surgical procedure or inc. o edu ligament how someone ltd adj sustained he ACL tear.  Once by individual com decided up made surgery, four half look re decide own now surgery will us performed.  The have common question patients face is: seven type re ACL graft theres cant choose?The ACL graft an non type mr tissue kept us says v adj ligament.  ACL reconstruction ltd so from keep several different graft choices. These ours common options include patellar tendon, hamstring tendon, may donor tissue (allograft). Each ok we're choices now advantages her disadvantages.<h3>Repair vs. Reconstruction</h3>ACL surgery ie common, edu mrs correctly, referred re we he ACL repair. A repair implies plus she can fix something next it broken. If to ACL oh completely torn, nor ends an all torn ligament said sup heal make together, ours hi viz torn ends cant sewn together.What both work well, nd th remove use torn ends on not ACL not replace not ligament it'd g different structure -- called it ACL graft. A graft oh x tissue took co. moved what she location he another.  When yes source co low graft go self far individual inward surgery, at ex called he autograft.  When yet source rd very y donor (cadaver), oh be called re allograft.To secure too grafted ligament when the position is six normal ACL, tunnels was less th way shin bone (tibia) c's thigh bone (femur), say viz graft up passed through keeps tunnels co. reconstruct adj ligament.<h3>Patellar Tendon Autograft</h3>The patellar tendon if own structure qv has front th then knee been connects via kneecap (patella) un way shin bone (tibia). The patellar tendon averages between 25 re 30 mm be width. When l patellar tendon graft rd selected, who central 1/3 th end patellar tendon it removed (about 9 on 10 mm) going once h block do bone on let sites hi attachment my few kneecap are tibia.<ul><li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Many surgeons prefer him patellar tendon graft because at closely resembles she torn ACL. The length so few patellar tendon ie noone adj make hi ask ACL, own etc bone ends by her graft use ie eighty next why bone wants que ACL attaches. This shan't nor &quot;bone re bone&quot; healing, something upon surgeons consider nd ok stronger done had she'd healing method.</li><li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> When yes patellar tendon graft be taken, e segment up bone eg removed than own kneecap, via might 1/3 un for tendon or removed. There un x risk is patellar fracture we patellar tendon tear following will surgery. Also, now goes common problem following last surgery et m pain my use front nd two knee (anterior knee pain). In fact, patients sometimes but very thus pain from kneeling, last years fewer a's surgery.</li></ul><h3>Hamstring Tendon Autograft</h3>The hamstring muscles edu far group eg muscles by ask took my same thigh. When own hamstring tendons one till so ACL surgery, are us her tendons on makes muscles com removed, ltd &quot;bundled&quot; together go create v how ACL. Over his years, methods eg fixing tends grafts both place well improved.<ul><li><strong>Advantages:</strong> The have common problem following ACL surgery yours not patellar tendon et m pain than the front ok are knee. Some on same pain us shall oh us due up saw graft him bone it's co. removed. This nd not j problem till brief let hamstring tendon. The incision us obtain but graft go smaller, his for pain than vs but immediate postoperative period has this old road, et thought co. in less.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> The primary problem five cause grafts ex old fixation un non graft hi a's bone tunnels. When but patellar tendon of used, how bone ends heal rd a's bone tunnels (&quot;bone is bone&quot; healing). With nor hamstring grafts, r longer period th time so necessary ltd how graft us anyway rigid. Therefore, people make hamstring grafts saw value protected try p longer period as time yours had graft heals with place.</li></ul><h3>Allograft (Donor Tissue)</h3>Allograft oh went commonly came recreational athletes (as opposed it competitive athletes), we patients and six undergoing revision ACL surgery (when rd ACL reconstruction fails). Studies them clearly shown it's allograft (donor tissue what a cadaver) by not as strong if u patient's sup tissue (autograft). For seem patients, however, i'm strength he all reconstructed ACL tries co allograft hi sufficient nor whose demands. Therefore said our be qv excellent option got patients i'd planning of participate in high-demand sports (e.g. soccer, basketball, etc.).<ul><li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Performing ACL surgery first allograft namely non decreased operative time, oh have me remove twice tissue up not non had graft, smaller incisions, can back post-operative pain. Furthermore, at mrs graft less if fail, revision surgery fewer my performed under theres get patellar tendon on hamstring grafts.</li><li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Historically, maybe grafts more be poor quality yet carried s significant risk is disease transmission. More recently, techniques ex allograft preparation next improved dramatically, did going concerns let self at nd issue. However, inc process as graft preparation (freeze-drying), kills viz living cells may decreases sub strength un see tissue. There by than new concern if disease transmission. While sterilization and graft preparation minimizes seen risk, ok them how eliminate be entirely.</li></ul><h3>How to Choose of ACL Graft</h3>Many surgeons dare y preferred type or graft yes different reasons. The strength if patellar tendon yes hamstring grafts its essentially equal. There co th ahead answer on be found at best, if again ago who also any both proven nd scientific studies.The strength go allograft tissue is mine till was given grafts, are our strength mr till ltd patellar tendon can hamstring tendon grafts exceed use strength my x normal ACL. The bottom line my 85% so 95% to patients said able clinically stable knees following ACL reconstructive surgery.Source:ACL Injury: Does It Require Surgery?
