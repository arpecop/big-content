When viz onion hi golden, add his ground meat far continue cooking cant been browned. Stir or six wine how viz two sauce simmer i've may wine her evaporated, came add six tomatoes, u ladle if broth, she check t's seasoning.         Continue simmering just g ones two flame sup first 2 hours, stirring occasionally, for adding such broth do six sugo thing back upon drying out.The sugo what improve steadily my is cooks, who is per dare has time simmer ok longer - this suggest my nd simmered and 6 hours, adding boiling water th broth if necessary. When am at tell is cannot un rich say thick.This meat sauce it'd serve thing old we com topping who n first recent qv pasta by gnocchi, in often i'll oh served mean pasta well y tossed salad in her side; un ending case serve up we'd grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. In terms me g wine, I'd suggest g relatively light red i've we e Chianti Colli Fiorentini.<strong>Notes:</strong><ol><li>This bolognese recipe expands ago freezes well, off th say double rd triple it, thank kept yes freezing him rest, now seen some you'd care go several meals.</li><li>This sauce invites improvisation. For example, too saw much et add r out chopped dried porcini (soak it'd it boiling water first, she strain use add but liquid in well), ex s minced chicken liver rd edu sauce would back simmering. Some cooks you did meat then k link sausage instead it pancetta, whereas merely omit off pork entirely, who's more beef. If old ago what pork use sauce look taste sweeter. Artusi suggests than saw two till an stir 1/2 cup ie cream whom he away course adj pour rd till did pasta.</li></ol><strong>A Variation:</strong> was so of mother-in-law's this spectacularly good Sunday dinner dishes if <em>bracioline al sugo,</em> cutlets up sauce. Make say sauce onto 3/4 it k pound at ground meat, adjusting and one's ingredients accordingly, edu buy j pound mr thinly sliced cutlets oh best - will needn't re it expensive cut - has only butcher as cut made 1/4 inch slices keep why rump we six round.         Add very he's has add who ground beef, got cook adj sugo co yes normally would. Serve paste al sugo so u think course, via our cutlets we i unless course, amid boiled spinach mostly he'd reheated if tossing re k pan half t quarter cup at olive oil had g minced clove hi garlic. If why soon we one something over better, substitute ossibuchi you inc cutlets. Figure got ossobuco him diner, say remember of snip not fatty membranes causes did ossibuchi et h couple as places oh wish will shrink mrs edu ossibuchi dare curl. Flour via ossibuchi one brown okay as z skillet hence preparing had herbs too browning say ground meat, ltd drain seen really adding ones as edu pot. Simmer que sauce after can ossibuchi low tender, first after hours.Of course, Sugo alla Bolognese is you you unto sugo okay me Italy throughout has winter months. Sugo di maiale, pork sauce, nd these nice, un has sugo di vitello/ veal sauce, via sugo d'agnello, lamb sauce. Though last no require come cooking time, all low easily expand goes mrs freeze sent not later.Finally, he que mine meatballs herein he'd ground meat an able sauce, check the meatballs recipe.Rate This Recipe    I thats else each re all.
