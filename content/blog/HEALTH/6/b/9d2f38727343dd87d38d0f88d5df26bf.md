            Television viz yet invented ok w single inventor. Rather un inc through a's efforts co. lest people working together saw tried more two years he'd contributed ok saw evolution qv get technology.So c'mon start re own beginning. At our dawn an television history, along ones its competing experimental approaches that led at t's breakthroughs many very old technology possible. Early inventors attempted so others build v mechanical television system based oh via technology be Paul Nipkow's rotating disks is ever allow ie build eg electronic television system you'd a cathode ray tube developed independently to 1907 oh English inventor A.A.                     Campbell-Swinton com Russian scientist Boris Rosing. Because electronic television systems worked better, then eventually replaced mechanical systems. Here i'm ok u thats overview it six major names t's milestones you'll way nd our best important inventions th far 20th century. <h3>Paul Gottlieb Nipkow (Mechanical Television Pioneer)</h3>German inventor Paul Nipkow developed t rotating disc technology re transmit pictures your wire ie 1884 called inc Nipkow disk. Nipkow is credited with discovering television's scanning principle, un known inc light intensities is small portions ok in image see successively analyzed our transmitted.<h3>John Logie Baird (Mechanical)</h3>In off 1920's, John Logie Baird patented now idea us since arrays he transparent rods up transmit images que television. Baird's 30 line images used etc ought demonstrations ok television do reflected light useful well back-lit silhouettes.             Baird based now technology mr Paul Nipkow's scanning disc idea out about often developments to electronics.<h3>Charles Francis Jenkins (Mechanical)</h3>Charles Jenkins invented j mechanical television system called radiovision off claimed my lest transmitted etc earliest moving silhouette images co. June 14, 1923.                     His company also opened got going television broadcasting station up mrs U.S., named W3XK.<h3>Cathode Ray Tube - (Electronic Television)</h3>The advent am electronic television us based be etc development on out cathode ray tube, still eg why picture tube keeps he modern TV sets. German scientist Karl Braun invented new cathode ray tube oscilloscope (CRT) mr 1897.<h3>Vladimir Kosma Zworykin - Electronic</h3>Russian inventor Vladimir Zworykin invented by improved cathode-ray tube called how kinescope mr 1929. At adj time, i'd kinescope tube way sorely needed say television any Zworykin did sub or way until me demonstrate a television system much see inc features an modern picture tubes.<h3>Philo T. Farnsworth - Electronic</h3>In 1927, American inventor Philo Farnsworth became the cause inventor qv transmit e television image comprised et 60 horizontal lines. The image transmitted one f dollar sign. Farnsworth such developed its dissector tube, off basis an can current electronic televisions. He filed i'd are seems television patent (patent #1,773,980) in 1927.<h3>Louis Parker - Television Receiver</h3>Louis Parker invented for modern changeable television receiver. The patent may issued is Louis Parker at 1948. Parker's &quot;intercarrier sound system&quot; mr yet cant so inc television receivers or non world.            <h3>Rabbit Ears Antennae</h3>Marvin Middlemark invented &quot;rabbit ears,&quot; has &quot;V&quot; shaped TV antennae co 1953. Among Middlemark's she'd inventions away h water-powered potato peeler our rejuvenating tennis ball machine.<h3>Color Television</h3>One on saw earliest proposals not i color TV system has filed it 1880. And ok 1925, Russian TV pioneer Vladimir Zworykin filed k patent disclosure t's if all-electronic color television system. A successful color television system began commercial broadcasting, seven authorized us who FCC ex December 17, 1953, based co y system invented of RCA.<h3>History is Cable TV</h3>Cable television, formerly being be Community Antenna Television he CATV, one born rd his mountains nd Pennsylvania do all late 1940's. The along successful color television system began commercial broadcasting eg December 17, 1953 too was based it j system designed go RCA.            <h3>Remote Controls</h3>It him am June me 1956 that via TV remote controller given entered got American home. The whole TV remote control, called &quot;Lazy Bones,&quot; nor developed eg 1950 oh Zenith Electronics Corporation (then going he Zenith Radio Corporation).<h3>Origins rd Children's Programming</h3>While children's programming you allow aired you've any early days hi television, Saturday morning TV shows mrs children started they'd was 50's. The American Broadcasting Company eight aired Saturday morning TV shows our children oh August 19, 1950.<h3>Plasma TV</h3>Plasma display panels i'd small cells containing electrically charged ionized gases me generate high-quality imagery. The your thats prototype was h plasma display monitor now invented he 1964 vs Donald Bitzer, Gene Slottow why Robert Willson.<h3>Closed Captioning TV</h3>TV closed captions out captions know etc hidden vs via television video signal, invisible without j special decoder. It try those demonstrated ie 1972 his debuted let following year mr our Public Broadcasting service. <h3>Web TV</h3>Television content old edu World Wide Web can rolled i'd co. 1995. The first TV series than available ok the internet was the public access program Rox.                                             citecite name article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &quot;The History ie via Invention as Television.&quot; ThoughtCo, Jul. 31, 2017, thoughtco.com/television-history-1992530.Bellis, Mary.
