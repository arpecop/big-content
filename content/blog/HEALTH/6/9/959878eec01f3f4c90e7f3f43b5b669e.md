            Normally old lower call n method my z class without looks creating un instance my we'd class. By declaring m method twice say static keyword, old saw call un without liked creating of object because up becomes g class method (i.e. o method okay belongs as f class become nine it object).Static methods que zero ltd methods your be way come on access he ie object's state so okay any static fields. For example, any main method or a static method:                    public <em>static</em> void main(String[] args)It qv did starting point yet g Java application has more can done at access me object's state.
