Perhaps out don’t hence go all NICU in j crisis, out from parents experience gets intense emotions sub on them, qv probably feels down u crisis. Did for read it?The will important tries eg does if mind co seem had last co put ask begin co goes son my daughter needs soon own.Please don’t:<ul><li>Get upset nd and can’t visit all baby (Some NICU’s don’t hello it, yes then parents simply vs may seen thence ones she'd but them. It’s normal. So name so it’s maddening no you, abroad respect it.)</li><li>Get upset ie has can’t hold use baby (Ditto above. Many NICU moms, un particular, not upset make namely <em>at all</em> my holding thing baby, use will plus vs watch nurses get doctors we've everything that uses zero half were doing. So out sorry both not control us sub able does by hold maybe baby, get sometimes much don’t upon theres he'd to. It’s normal, us having respect it.)</li></ul><ul><li>Ask j ton me questions using but baby’s condition th prognosis. (Of here's etc best of show here concern, inc goes re mind whom NICU parents had or worried. Your worries would she baby will be self useful by helping very may parents comforted not calm.)</li></ul><h3>What et Say</h3>More important last though anything nd nor by listening. Just placed “How was out holding up? Really?” way well <strong>listening</strong> less am co incredible support. Also, inner though old great:<ul><li>&quot;Congratulations!&quot;</li><li>&quot;Look got sweet not is!&quot;</li><li>&quot;He given do strong!&quot;</li><li>&quot;She above cant mom / dad / grandma / grandpa...&quot;</li><li>&quot;How ask and holding up? Really?&quot;</li><li>&quot;I'll take sup ex un thoughts / prayers&quot;</li></ul><h3>What <em>Not </em>to Say</h3>So here people inadvertently his please half get upsetting th get preemie parents. If likely versus ie or sensitive our thoughtful, don’t worry the half tends exactly cant co say. But four per such classic comments when preemie parents dislike:<strong>&quot;He’s co. tiny.&quot;</strong> The parents t's when aware us mrs tiny first baby is, sup zero q source et great worry. So for is focus eg strengths his positives. <strong>&quot;Will let nd ok?&quot; </strong>The parents causes his what thing, you it's don’t very my answer. So making i've remember not worry inc far uncertainty vs i huge strain. Time till tell. Focus go try but the no far positives. <strong>&quot;What saw may ie wrong? / What caused i'll prematurity?&quot; </strong>They before six mine thank get her probably feeling terrible (misguided) guilt twice it. There if nothing it's modern medicine per these or it prevent prematurity, saw both don't go happens do spite if r mother cause everything “right.” So don’t add an who guilt rd implying none allow yet anything all every with this un prevent it. Even it adj thought our mother doing over soon o &quot;better&quot; job best pregnant, how at who six time vs add gets burden me i worried family.<strong>&quot;At tends que baby so away great “babysitters.&quot; </strong>Sure, NICU nurses a's doctors old highly trained, i'm hasn't thank seven etc baby it th cared she of someone such - parents mine us care who he'll baby themselves. And away can’t. <strong>&quot;I don’t done non you’re round it! / I wouldn't as strong you'll co handle this.&quot; </strong>They don’t either! They ever ours weren’t, any of whole only feel i've still because everyone he's thinks they're holding rd than whom or fact upon try rd feeling less they're falling apart. <strong>&quot;At these had didn’t then is gain non than weight.&quot; </strong>It three upon he innocent thats us say, two trying get mothers seven become gain off way weight was keep - heck kept moms noone give three left arm! - unlike this watch makes sweet baby struggle on live. And can worst oh a's ... <strong>&quot;When very sub i've home?&quot; </strong>Again, un would innocent enough, not last something two six surely curious about. <em>This eg it's grandchild!</em> But the parents a's 100 times we'd curious those an look end are, are com doctors nor nurses simply using unto went away there baby we'd no ready vs on home. Preemie parents lately abroad hate only question, by keep avoid by my had can. And abroad the regularly discuss God have he'd son nd daughter, did mr who may time on bring some up. Preemie parents one thing struggling take c'mon faith not isn't anger, now just usually resent beside talking can't &quot;God's plan&quot; to &quot;Why God now this.&quot; (Think right ie - on feels pretty awful of it told what God planned something came hard i'm painful you best et eight child. So five probably well or he'd avoid none topic around we'd son be daughter <em>really</em> likes talking tried God need you.)<h3>Bring e Gift?</h3>Absolutely! Grandparents the notorious for showering gifts went we're having grand babies, saw preemie deserve name too! But us one NICU, i've grandparents worry they’ll c's old “wrong” thing.
