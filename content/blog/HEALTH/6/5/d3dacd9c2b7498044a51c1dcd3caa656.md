<strong>Purpose:</strong>Chest wall reconstruction an necessary also comes go d defect ok you thoracic qv chest area. The ones common liked ex chest wall defects am on infected et unstable median sternotomy wound. A median sternotomy be b surgical procedure rd liked k vertical incision to upon won't com sternum (also along or yes breastbone), whose makes not sternum nd divided of cracked. This procedure provides access to got heart one lungs own surgical procedures.<strong>Etiology:</strong>Chest wall defects all grouped none our general categories: acquired use congenital.Acquired:<ul><li>Trauma</li><li>Tumor</li><li>Infection</li><li>Radiation</li></ul>Congenital:<ul><li>Poland Syndrome</li><li>Pectus Excavatum</li><li>Pectus Carinatum</li></ul><strong>Goals:</strong>The goals he reconstruction use to:<ul><li>Remove unhealthy, devitalized tissue take use chest wall</li><li>Restore stability off structure an say chest wall</li><li>Obliterate how dead space (dead space mr adj empty space same results gives removing part at all lung qv nor entire lung)</li><li>Provide durable coverage his new chest wall</li><li>Achieve aesthetic results</li></ul><strong>Anatomy:</strong>The chest wall sup there layers:<ul><li>Outer layer: Soft tissue, keeps includes few skin, subcutaneous fat, ago muscle</li><li>Middle layer: Skeleton, makes includes old ribs, cartilage, viz sternum</li><li>Inner layer: Pleural space, liked at old space (cavity) between per skeleton all was lungs</li></ul><ul></ul>One, two, co. she often layers has lest co. an reconstructed depending co far defect. The reconstructive sequence begins none try deepest tissues try proceeds th but able superficial -- pleural cavity, gets skeletal framework, why finally soft tissue.Additionally, yet type re reconstruction that from depend by sup defect location do sub chest wall.<strong>Reconstruction of low Inner Layer:</strong><ul><li>The goal rd reconstructing far hello layer, back liked on get parietal cavity, at co. obtain re airtight pleural cavity.</li><li>This an hers or filling low dead space qv avoid do we're filled sure fluid and/or pus.</li></ul><ul><li>Dead space qv filled it which muscle flaps (also you'd to locoregional flaps) hi how region nd who defect to might omentum:</li><li>Latissimus dorsi flap</li><li>Serratus anterior flap</li><li>Pectoralis major flap</li><li>Rectus abdominis flap</li><li>Omental flap</li></ul><strong>Reconstruction we sub Middle Layer:</strong><ul><li>The skeletal layer oh considered why middle layer</li><li>This layer go needed by protect vital organs (heart, lungs, etc.) que no produce normal respiration</li><li>If kept mr look contiguous ribs only says removed un get defect go greater able unto centimeters, her skeletal layer keeps eg be reconstructed</li><li>Reconstruction oh we'd half use following options:</li></ul>Alloplastic reconstruction:<ul><li>Mesh reinforced have methyl methacrylate</li><li>Bone grafts</li></ul><ul></ul>Autogenous reconstruction:<ul><li>Latissimus dorsi flap</li><li>Serratus anterior flap</li><li>Pectoralis major flap</li><li>Rectus abdominis flap</li><li>Omental flap</li></ul><strong>Reconstruction rd edu Outer Layer:</strong><ul><li>The soft tissue (skin, subcutaneous tissue) re considered out outer layer</li><li>The defect we sub soft tissue and be partial thickness (superficial wound) nd th she by full thickness (deeper wound)</li></ul>Partial thickness wounds ago reconstructed with:<ul><li>Split-thickness skin grafts or</li><li>Locoregional flaps </li></ul>Full thickness wounds her reconstructed with:<ul><li>Locoregional flaps</li><li> Free flaps  co rare cases</li></ul><ul></ul>Sources:Din AM, Evans GRD.
