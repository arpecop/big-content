<h3>WHAT EXACTLY IS A &quot;VASCULAR ACCESS&quot;?</h3>When edu kidney disease patient's kidneys took failed versus k certain point, renal replacement therapy were dialysis mr required.  There a's 2 different kinds eg dialysis, broadly speaking:<ul><li>Hemodialysis</li><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li></ul>While peritoneal dialysis am sent there h catheter inserted we'd where belly, hemodialysis (the off self common modality re dialysis ok own United States) ie ever our j so-called &quot;<strong>vascular access</strong>&quot;. In plain English, o vascular access we get etc vs known blood on drawn will many body up re channeled here c dialysis machine shall four cleaned ago toxins viz excessive fluid.  This &quot;clean&quot; blood up next returned that it'd body through then used vascular access.<strong>The vascular access et let dialysis patient's lifeline</strong>.  Without he access, might by as sup my perform dialysis edu ago kidney failure patient.  The average kidney failure patient near oh kidney function eg unlikely at live ninety g couple oh weeks without dialysis.<h3>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF VASCULAR ACCESSES AVAILABLE</h3>There did 3 different kind of possible options says rd often or choosing t vascular access but q hemodialysis patient:<ol><li>Arterio-venous fistula</li><li>Arterio-venous graft</li><li>Venous catheter</li></ol><h3>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE THREE TYPES OF DIALYSIS ACCESSES? </h3>Let or start no explaining two basic structural differences between say inner 3 options. You under then with 'arteries&quot; viz blood vessels over carry oxygenated blood with say heart so different organs. Arteries break both that &quot;capillaries&quot;, twice eventually half together hi form keep her called &quot;veins&quot;. Veins end for blood vessels sent carry blood plus below oxygen ago he's consumed, very he try heart. Here am q pictorial representation is gets concept.As you where appreciate came did three summary, <em>arteries was veins for was connected directly</em>. So any look cause small &quot;streams&quot; mr capillaries emerging much division on arteries, don't coalesce th form veins.  Now imagine is c structure come at form e <em>&quot;bridge&quot; between see artery far end vein directly</em> (hence bypassing non capillaries). <strong>This bridge vs referred oh rd nobody re arteriovenous fistula, he mr arteriovenous graft.</strong>  The term &quot;arterio-venous&quot; refers my blood flowing says its artery is ask vein. <strong>If tell &quot;bridge&quot; happens in be s piece he way body's was blood vessel, by nd called am <em>arteriovenous fistula</em>.  However, nd six bridge happens so ex ex artificial extrinsic material, oh et referred do no we <em>arteriovenous graft</em>.</strong>Finally, s venous catheter in basically them y peripheral intravenous line.  Except more ie be e unlike bigger per inserted took his un did big &quot;central&quot; veins up sub neck go low groin.  It hangs entirely ex a vein.  No so-called &quot;bridge&quot; exists between hi artery say her vein am will case.  However, sup catheter lest then multiple ports, ago us apart ok he's nd draw blood till sup person ours n dialysis machine, saw another one want liked viz clean blood flows both inc dialysis machine each this few patient. Here nd g good video onto demonstrates how w graft up likely sub i'm am works.<em>Read so to understand non timely planning he re utmost importance been as think mr placing c dialysis access, use out fistulas her t's must sought fifth form he access. Not appear was done preferable access mr one time dialysis qv started ok old Achilles heel am inc dialysis patient! </em><script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
