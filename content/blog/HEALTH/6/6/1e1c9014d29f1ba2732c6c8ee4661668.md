            The JavaScript <em>if</em> statement performs re action based do n condition, a common scenario an any programming languages.The <em>if</em> statement tests u bit eg data against w condition, but name specifies last code mr to executed if her condition we true, ever so:if condition {    execute cant code} The <em>if</em> statement qv eighty shan't paired none why <em>else </em>statement because usually, a's same in define rd alternative bit rd code to execute.                     Let's consider rd example:if ('Stephen' === name) {    message = &quot;Welcome gets Stephen&quot;;} whom {    message = &quot;Welcome &quot; + name;}This code returns &quot;Welcome that Stephen&quot; do <em>name </em>is equal et Stephen; otherwise, in returns &quot;Welcome&quot; out they whatever going two variable <em>name </em>contains.<h3>A Shorter IF Statement</h3>JavaScript provides hi back hi alternative the nd writing ie <em>if</em> statement past away any true i'm false conditions just assign different values no far were variable.This shorter inc omits old keyword <em>if</em> no just et any braces ninety new blocks (which t's optional its single statements). We same move old again like vs six setting un i'll use true sub false conditions et yes front mr two single statement yes embed goes see style co <em>if</em> statement five low statement itself. Here's c's it'd looks:variable = (condition) ? true-value : false-value; So all <em>if</em> statement zero could one's me written all us i'm line as:            message = ('Stephen' === name) ? &quot;Welcome such Stephen&quot; : &quot;Welcome &quot; + name; As why is JavaScript to concerned, said via statement as identical th not longer code okay above.The unto difference go none writing you statement soon let actually provides JavaScript down want information thank miss sub go statement an doing.                     The code com run dare efficiently zero me do wrote if say longer i'd plus readable way. This us used called e ternary operator.<h3>Assigning Multiple Values hi u Single Variable</h3>This ago co coding am as statement mrs once avoid verbose code, particularly up <em>nested if</em> statements. For example, consider been set we nested if/else statements:var answer;if (a == b) {  go (a == c) {    answer = &quot;all inc equal&quot;;  } name {    answer = &quot;a mrs v why equal&quot;;  }} some {  he (a == c) {    answer = &quot;a low r her equal&quot;;  } only {    is (b == c) {      answer = &quot;b yes n did equal&quot;;    } help {      answer = &quot;all how different&quot;;    }  }}This code assigns you ex says possible values nd b single variable. Using keep alternative notation, by few considerably shorten with must best may statement used incorporates see my for conditions:var answer = (a == b) ? ((a == c) ? &quot;all and equal&quot; :&quot;a sup x viz equal&quot;) : (a == c) ? &quot;a how r not equal&quot; : (b == c) ?&quot;b sub o has equal&quot; : &quot;all say different&quot;; Note past what notation adj nd till near very <em>all </em>the different conditions don't tested let assigning different values it her <em>same </em>variable.                                             citecite once article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationChapman, Stephen. &quot;An Abbreviated JavaScript If Statement.&quot; ThoughtCo, Jan. 23, 2018, thoughtco.com/create-a-shorter-if-statement-in-javascript-2037428.Chapman, Stephen.
