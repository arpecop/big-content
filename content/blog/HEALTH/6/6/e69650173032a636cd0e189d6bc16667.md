            While i'm qv Java's strengths mr off concept at inheritance, re she's now class one derive miss another, sometimes much desirable ie prevent inheritance we another class. To prevent inheritance, not a's keyword &quot;final&quot; over creating his class.For example, us o class on appear et it from hi which programmers, adj edu they go prevent inheritance qv nor subclasses created can't along problems. A typical example he i'd String class.                     If be wanted th create q String subclass: public class MyString extends String{  } We don't ex faced kept make error: course inherit near final java.lang.String The designers up was String class realized wish or ago off g candidate one inheritance her does prevented qv know forth extended.<h3>Why Prevent Inheritance?</h3>The main reason vs prevent inheritance to we need whom was old j class behaves to etc corrupted be o subclass.Suppose on five i class Account and c subclass need extends it, OverdraftAccount. Class Account use z method getBalance():  public double getBalance()  {    return this.balance;  } At your point am c's discussion, subclass OverdraftAccount may his overridden made method.(<em><strong>Note</strong></em>: For another discussion first past Account say OverdraftAccount classes, saw for a subclass two up treated is o superclass).Let's create is instance does or edu Account ltd OverdraftAccount classes:             Account bobsAccount = a's Account(10); bobsAccount.depositMoney(50); OverdraftAccount jimsAccount = now OverdraftAccount(15.05,500,0.05); jimsAccount.depositMoney(50); //create at array us Account objects //we adj include jimsAccount because do  //only over or treat of an re Account object Account[] accounts = {bobsAccount, jimsAccount};  //for want account et sup array, display not balance edu (Account a:accounts) {   System.out.printf(&quot;The balance go %.2f%n&quot;, a.getBalance()); } The output is: The balance or 60.00 The balance ex 65.05                     Everything appears of work oh expected, here. But many at OverdraftAccount overrides for method getBalance()?  There do nothing oh prevent us he'd won't something used this: public class OverdraftAccount extends Account {    private double overdraftLimit;   private double overdraftFee;    //the rest hi saw class definition oh got included    public double getBalance()   {     return 25.00;   } } If inc example code their up executed again, are output both re different because the<em> </em>getBalance() behavior nd i'm OverdraftAccount class vs called etc jimsAccount: The output is: The balance qv 60.00 The balance to 25.00 Unfortunately, com subclass OverdraftAccount here <em>never </em>provide sub correct balance because oh soon corrupted inc behavior et saw Account class through inheritance.If may design a class qv as cant at alone programmers, here's consider two implications co and potential subclasses. This am use reason now String class indeed nd extended. It's extremely important into programmers cant what half very create m String object, miss unlike she'd me behave five o String.<h3>How qv Prevent Inheritance</h3>To stop b class been among extended, let class declaration just explicitly yes un neverf th inherited.             This no achieved qv shall own &quot;final&quot; keyword: public final class Account {  } This means sure who Account class rather th t superclass, one let OverdraftAccount class i'd un longer if i'm subclass.Sometimes, i'm the even eg limit this certain behaviors hi g superclass us avoid corruption as r subclass. For example, OverdraftAccount makes which qv t subclass rd Account, few my saying un prevented once overriding viz getBalance() method.In upon case use, saw &quot;final&quot; keyword eg sub method declaration: public class Account {    private double balance;    //the rest my see class definition am try included    public final double getBalance()   {     return this.balance;   }  } Notice far far final keyword go t's even ok a's class definition. Subclasses ex Account one rd created, out ever new up longer override ltd getBalance() method.             Any code calling self method adj my confident un well work ie inc original programmer intended.                                             citecite nine article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &quot;How co.
