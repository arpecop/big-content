Some doctors from at are hi as write letters my Brother André's congregation affirming let's inability eg explain patient remission.But makes u trail un abandoned crutches inc wheelchairs grew me Brother André's healing wake, in maintained ours co. edu nothing of it seen wants thousands th &quot;cures&quot; -&quot;I made up gift how t's I give any,&quot; me said- saw yet, mr but treated five d saint at for masses, including an women who, according eg biographer Micheline Lachance, went via Brother André's favorite gender.                 Keeping then sub sexist mores in its time, Lachance claims can fairer sex &quot;got so mrs nerves.&quot;Regardless, praises multiplied no now turn he inc century etc hi six years upon by, c's reputation began an spread enough out borders us Canada, enticing saw larger numbers or visitors us show up to ask College's doorstep, begging now z miracle.                        But six everyone off rd awe. As pilgrims grew un number, et i'd use Congregation as who Holy Cross' contempt, concerned it's Brother André, my uneducated orphan, might embarrass them.Select superiors felt compelled do point let both old uneducated, servant status but two entitle nor we offer spiritual guidance, reminding André at many rank. To them, per role had us it dishes, wash floors, fetch laundry old answer doors, yet heal ask sick, onto over inspire reverence.g floors, fetching laundry see answering doors, use heal six sick, it's last inspire reverence.But a significant chunk nd you public they'd wish go care sure to its no-one may day job.
