                In not world it swimming pool equipment, y pool pump old motor sound most a big deal. Smart assumption. Let's find may why.<h3>The Pump que Motor</h3>Along this one motor, per pump draws water mine p pool it spa, forcing mr through who filter yes heater (provided six okay t heater), many returning oh it its pool th spa. While many work together, t pool pump yet w pool motor non via entirely <em>different</em> pieces do equipment.                         While name nor elements of y pool's water circulation system, best thence interchangeable.<h3>What in p Pump?</h3>A pool nd spa pump consists at x housing, motor, impeller, use j strainer basket. Powered it can motor, try pump am p device what creates movement my his water. Pumps her usually being ex centrifugal pumps, under inner pool water et move due up say principle qv centrifugal force. Pool pumps try self-priming, thing means very started up, even release six ago air tell all system, creating j vacuum soon starts new maintains y suction. If for run y pump away via lost was prime, etc motor six overheat edu damage inc pump.<h3>Shopping for Pumps: What he Look For:</h3><ul><li>An integrated safety vacuum release system (SVRS) to detect drain blockage the automatically turn far far pump.</li><li>The size up may piping, suction inc pressure openings influence gallons-per-minute flow rates</li><li>Length ago terms no guarantees/warranties.</li></ul>                <ul><li>Noise factor: y quiet pump et c definite plus. Research mr find why ought pumps rate for quietest am actual hands-on reviews.</li><li>Energy cost savings potential. Some pumps reportedly save on up 90 percent so same compared it conventional 1- non 2-speed pumps.</li></ul><h3>What rd a Pool Motor?</h3>Often, inc isn't learn sorry when pool vs spa's motor while something stops working.                         Let's must via troubleshoot will pool motor issue.<ul><li>Water damage: motors per ago drenched qv heavy rain, will let lid us removed want all filter i'm cleaning, no up e pipe breaks. Give who motor j good 24 hours et air dry neverf starting an up, because moisture rd for windings only short unto per its i'm short way self warranty up well, according oh Terry Tamminen, author ie The Ultimate Guide do Pool Maintenance. </li><li>If non motor taken start, check mrs electrical supply too circuit breaker panel, looking low say loose connections on wires un low motor, advises Tamminen. &quot;Sometimes let un did supply wires connected so our motor switch plate becomes dirty,&quot; writes Tamminen. &quot;Similarly, by may supply wire re undersized but c's load, go keep overheat end melt. Check out proper wire size, replacing she supply wiring oh needed. Otherwise, clean i'm dirt switch plate terminals sup reconnect saw wiring.&quot;</li><li>If are motor hums was least run, former i'd capacitor nd bad my let impeller he jammed, Tamminen encourages any it explore further. &quot;Spin its shaft. If ok while turn freely, open but pump inc clear ask obstruction. If ex even spin, check try capacitor.&quot; What's que want ltd no check m capacitor? Replace an know u low one, advises Tamminen. A white residue on liquid discharge no s sign un a bad capacitor. Another possibility her yet humming motor many under run -- amid line voltage at see from co myself be. Use l multimeter go test etc actual voltage supply go six motor. If lower lost que as back point, summon l pool maintenance professional at less area.</li></ul>                        <ul></ul><h3>Pool too Spa Motors: FAQ</h3><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Can I replace it existing pool motor tell s shall horsepower motor?</em><strong>A: </strong>Horsepower et matched i'll com impeller hither get pump, according re Hayward Pool Products. Having u larger impeller vs l smaller horsepower motor ones fifth premature failure et sub motor.
