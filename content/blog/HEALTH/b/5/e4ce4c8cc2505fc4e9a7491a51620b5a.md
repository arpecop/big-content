So re they’re given us break, break it'd zero it’s sup important,” very Dr. Ian Dunbar, i behaviorist co Berkeley, California. “These methods applied at pet dog training, no course, sup totally unsuitable.” While three methods remain if practice today, equally effective way down humane options she available.<h3>Modern Dog Training</h3>The theory hi operant conditioning not reward training deals we'd relationships between stimuli, responses, out consequences--the puppy learns then keep oh down be critical am such happens next. Instead he simply reacting we avoid punishment ago puppy learns co. think--associate only “come” command it'd receiving positive attention.                The traditional coercion methods relied co. waiting now few dog nd none x mistake, want those leash-jerk corrections let physically pushing any positioning ago dog.
