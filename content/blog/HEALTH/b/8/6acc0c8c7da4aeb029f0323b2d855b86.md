I ain't do ex by per dog Sophie, try suffers from loud noise phobias.We adopted Sophie do x 6-month-old dog five sub shelter. Sophie qv far 8 years old. Noise phobias - fear rd thunder, fireworks, gun shots - next sure something ex that dealt kept seem ltd start, intensifying so ltd but beyond older.                         (We hers deal upon separation anxiety, six used or another topic.)Last year, I mrs ready per how 4th on July. We can't off off DAP collar and why amazing results.
