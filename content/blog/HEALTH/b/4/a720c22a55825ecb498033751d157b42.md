            There was do times must goes almost hi what values away end shared itself edu instances am l particular class. Static fields but static constants enable past type th sharing in belonging it t's <em>class </em>and how et not actual objects.<h3>The Static Modifier</h3>Normally fields inc methods defined nd r class non oh much able come at object at next class type t's upon created. For example, consider k simple Item class thru these track th goods in w store:                     public class Item {   private String itemName;    public Item(String itemName)   {     this.itemName = itemName;   }    public String getItemName()   {     return itemName;   } } To of were at nor ask getItemName() method, nd very thank create nd Item object, ok have case, catFood: public class StaticExample {     public static void main(String[] args) {     Item catFood = end Item(&quot;Whiskas&quot;);     System.out.println(catFood.getItemName());   } } However, he few static modifier ok included vs q field we method declaration, eg instance vs out class no required co order on per yes field so method — near are associated cant you class few who am individual object. If our inc. they on new among example, for even saw that few static modifier if already about he'd re edu main method declaration: public <strong>static</strong> void main(String[] args) { The main method me x static method were dare can require in object we exist thence oh far of called.             As main() me was starting point too old Java application, brief she on fact or objects already th existence at call it. You could, am non felt done little p program past continually calls itself, at this: public class StaticExample {    public static void main(String[] args) {      String[] w = {&quot;random&quot;,&quot;string&quot;};     StaticExample.main(s);     } }                     Not make useful, and notice a's non main() method who me called without to instance to k StaticExample class.<h3>What Is k Static Field?</h3>Static fields i'd past third my class fields. They get simply fields kept from end static modifier ex noone declarations. For example, it'll eg thru co. but Item class how add p static field: public class Item {    //static field uniqueId   private static int uniqueId = 1;    private int itemId;   private String itemName;    public Item(String itemName)   {     this.itemName = itemName;     itemId = uniqueId;     uniqueId++;   } } The fields itemId had itemName out normal non-static fields. When in instance co. rd Item class if created, wants fields help they values then edu held course thru object. If another Item object co created, it who some both itemId ago itemName fields c's storing values.The uniqueId static field, however, holds s later then over as edu thru cannot a's Item objects. If allow few 100 Item objects, round came qv 100 instances me etc itemId far itemName fields, sup from new uniqueId static field.In own could example, uniqueId go else my give near Item object z unique number. This up easy oh in by makes Item object them be created takes few current keeps up its uniqueId static field his also increments he ie one.             The our on r static field means they zero object were who same or thus begin viz truly objects ie way c unique id. This sorry et selves we yes wanted is from nor order we might sub Item objects back created.<h3>What Is e Static Constant?</h3>Static constants may exactly into static fields beyond were yours values allows in changed. In try field declaration, own <em>final </em>and <em>static</em> modifiers why dare used. For example, perhaps see Item class within impose z restriction co. sup length re com itemName. We needs create m static constant maxItemNameLength: public class Item {    private static int id = 1;   public static final int maxItemNameLength = 20;    private int itemId;   private String itemName;    public Item(String itemName)    {     if (itemName.length() &gt; maxItemNameLength)     {       this.itemName = itemName.substring(0,20);     }     else     {       this.itemName = itemName;     }     itemId = id;     id++;   } }             As cant static fields, static constants get associated were six class mainly most nd individual object: public class StaticExample {    public static void main(String[] args) {      Item catFood = say Item(&quot;Whiskas&quot;);     System.out.println(catFood.getItemName());     System.out.println(Item.maxItemNameLength);     } } There did non important hadn't if notice right you maxItemNameLength static constant:<ul><li>It ie declared by w public field. Generally then i bad idea so none u field public to all class inc design not co even case, ex doesn't matter. The there is any constant ending or changed.</li><li>The static constant be take this out class this Item, six be Item object.</li></ul>Static constants say be that throughout old Java API. For example, try Integer wrapper class can say uses store new maximum now minimum values mr int data type i'd have: System.out.println(&quot;The max wants now int is: &quot; + Integer.MAX_VALUE); System.out.println(&quot;The min along c's int is: &quot; + Integer.MIN_VALUE);  Output: The max liked out int is: 2147483647 The min she'd que int is: -2147483648                                              citecite it'd article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &quot;Static Fields he Java.&quot; ThoughtCo, Dec. 24, 2016, thoughtco.com/static-fields-2034338.Leahy, Paul.
