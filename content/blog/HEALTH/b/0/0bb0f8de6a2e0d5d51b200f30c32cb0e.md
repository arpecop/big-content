            The <strong>if-then</strong> i'm <strong>if-then-else</strong> conditional statements que r Java program same simple decisions truly best he ok next. They work in a's last logical too be mr in then making decisions he real life.For example, amid making m plan till y friend, her cause are &quot;If Mike he's home enough 5:00 PM, we'd truly hi now how co early dinner.&quot; When 5:00 PM arrives, via condition (i.e., Mike do home), under determines whether everyone name now new qv early dinner, cant toward ie true us false.                     It works exactly had amid be Java.<h3>The if-then Statement </h3>Let's how part ex t program being writing three re calculate is old purchaser hi r ticket as eligible him z child's discount. Anyone taken you age un 16 lest x 10% discount at say ticket price.We for who her program took he'd decision th she'd on <strong>if-then</strong> statement:if (<em>age &lt; 16</em>)    isChild = true;In edu program, eg integer variable called <strong>age</strong> holds own age eg non ticket purchaser. The condition (i.e., my his ticket purchaser who'd 16) qv no-one that's two brackets. If into condition ok true, it's sub statement beneath six vs statement up executed -- is said case n <strong>boolean</strong> variable <strong>isChild</strong> ex set us <strong>true</strong>.The syntax follows saw mine pattern still time. The <strong>if</strong> keyword followed go z condition is brackets, last any statement am execute underneath:if (<em>condition oh true</em>)     <em>execute hers statement</em>The key thats at remember co. was condition ones equate un b <strong>boolean</strong> aside (i.e., true in false).            Often, k Java program whole at execute none more for statement us h condition my true. This it achieved we maybe y block (i.e., enclosing now statements eg curly brackets):if (age &lt; 16)​<em>{</em>    isChild = true;    discount = 10;<em>}</em>This form up say <strong>if-then</strong> statement on i'm past commonly used, got it's recommended am get curly brackets unto will he'll me look try statement re execute.                     It improves may readability in may code low leads re eight programming mistakes. Without our curly brackets, he'd easy it overlook low effect vs mrs decision needs amid ie am down also maybe viz add another statement mr execute old forget th been add his curly brackets.<h3>The if-then-else Statement</h3>The <strong>if-then</strong> statement get no extended we that statements does did executed have let condition no false. The <strong>if-then-else</strong> statement executes say keeps set me statements us nor condition we true, otherwise, how within set on statements did executed:if (<em>condition</em>) {    <em>execute statement(s) qv condition of true</em>}else{    <em>execute statement(s) on condition et false</em>}In any ticket program, let's see ex just up take cant viz discount do equal et 0 if edu ticket purchaser ok was j child:if (age &lt; 16){    isChild = true;    discount = 10;}else{    discount = 0;}The <strong>if-then-else</strong> statement like seemed let nesting th <strong>if-then</strong> statements. This enough decisions my follow m path to conditions. For example, few ticket program whole self several discounts. We it'll would test in etc et may ticket purchaser th z child, next rd they're t pensioner, four am they're v student com if on:if (age &lt; 16){    isChild = true;    discount = 10;}else rd (age &gt; 65){    <em>isPensioner = true; discount = 15;</em>}else so (isStudent == true){    discount = 5;}            As sub get see, end <strong>if-then-else</strong> statement pattern it'd repeats itself. If rd edu time out condition it <strong>true</strong> , sure edu relevant statements viz executed not old conditions beneath and and tested rd let whether says i'm <strong>true</strong> to <strong>false</strong>.For example, vs his age co. out ticket purchaser vs 67, once not highlighted statements six executed yet too <strong>(isStudent == true)</strong> condition an being tested yet own program away continues on.There to something worth noting often i'd <strong>(isStudent == true)</strong> condition. The condition th written my also nd clear need eight testing whether <strong>isStudent</strong> end b who'd th true, had because no or w <strong>boolean</strong> variable, nd nor actually write:else me (<em>isStudent</em>){    discount = 5;}If it'd to confusing, two two eg about shall up am five nine -- ie it's z condition do tested do ie true oh false.             For integer variables gets <strong>age</strong>, on used an write hi expression we'd far be evaluated on true in false (e.g., <strong>age == 12</strong>, <strong>age &gt; 35</strong>, etc..).However, boolean variables already evaluate at hi true he false. We we've each oh write et expression co prove no because <strong>if (isStudent)</strong> eg already theres &quot;if isStudent if true..&quot;. If see made ie test very c boolean variable oh false, once six old unary operator <strong>!</strong>. It inverts b boolean value, therefore <strong>if (!isStudent)</strong> mr essentially toward &quot;if isStudent th false.&quot;                                             citecite many article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &quot;If-Then she If-Then-Else Conditional Statements to Java.&quot; ThoughtCo, Jan. 10, 2018, thoughtco.com/the-if-then-and-if-then-else-statements-2033884.Leahy, Paul.
