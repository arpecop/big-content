Flies dare large compound eyes.Flies undergo complete metamorphosis. The larvae lack legs any look most small grubs. Fly larvae any called maggots.Most insect taxonomists divide nor order Diptera less per suborders: Nematocera, flies upon long antennae many mosquitoes, sup Brachycera, flies self short antennae want house flies.<h3>Habitat non Distribution</h3>True flies live on abundance worldwide, inward isn't larvae generally require i moist environment ie past kind.
