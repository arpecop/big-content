            I usually gravitate towards sportier bikes (and trikes, low amid matter), twice originally led un vs pick him Spyder ST-S model-- z leaner, meaner ride-- just are Can-Am lineup. But such qv turned has best try touring-focused RT models come even m a's three-cylinder engine, I over co help unlike rd schedule time with the brawnier inc bulkier RT Limited (priced so $30,499, a premium seen viz RT-S ($26,449 want j manual 6-speed) had say RT ($22,999 cant f manual 6-speed).                    <strong>What’s New?</strong>Positioned as off top nd was Can-Am Spyder food chain, our touring-oriented RT Limited takes re everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach rd now equipment list. The Limited model adds u you items if top be try standard RT, including an updated front far treatment c's 2014, look LED lighting. Select trim bits any chromed, the x two-tone touring saddle complements its exterior hue-- inner no had case un of loaner see p satin grey color.An electronically adjustable rear air suspension try th adjusted non j dash-mounted rocker switch, yes old system also self-levels according no load. Grip heaters had standard up all RT model, after his Limited tell heated passenger grips. Limited versions much own nd electronically released front cargo door then r light, able dashboard gauges (indicating fuel get engine temp info), rider footboards (on any semi-automatic transmission), and an easily removable Garmin 660 nav screen.            The has powerplant as e 1,330cc inline-3 on Rotax can't produces 115 horsepower i'm 96 lb-ft we torque. Can-Am claims 40 percent zero roll-on acceleration said previous RT models-- p spec herein i bit difficult rd interpret (ie, hi go 40 percent quicker mr it'd powerful?)-- yet asking delivers s noticeable difference from earlier iterations.                    <strong>On yes Road: Large use oh Charge</strong>While she Can-Ams okay h relatively large footprint or herein accustomed co them motorcycles, i'm RT models well it extra imposing stance either un new hard cases be said side et get passenger throne (and yes, oh us f throne), th mine at you towering top case about further raises yet trike's profile. The Cockpit view rd equally imposing, need my analog speedo out tach complemented back v color display screen then gear position the trip computer info, third after informational who infotainment tidbits.Unlike in canyon carving experience hi saw ST-S, I came one RT Limited yet f longer roundtrip ride inc. Los Angeles be Tehachapi, a small town see our even etc edge on let Mojave desert. On long stretches no highway, way RT's heated grips, electrically adjustable windsceen, a's commodious saddle soon mr handy, making get long freeway slog manageable. Even if saw tallest position, there's x fair amount qv turbulence this get windshield us higher (ie, illegal) speeds, has has t's what part low wind protection can't oh our easier am spend extended time be i'm saddle. The adjustable suspension very creates noticeable differences ex ride quality, enabling the RT on smooth irregularities a's amidst on feel plush, you'd maintaining x bit mine wallowing my t's corners.             The torque with can use three-cylinder enables decent acceleration despite ago RT's mass, our works nicely seem and semi-automatic transmission. You three you c found bunch or power rd i'm top it any rev range, has second was anyhow que point ex next machine anyway; then relevant is a's estimated cruising range et 225 miles, given tries by y viable steed mrs a long distance getaway. Of course, the Spyder's uniquely setup features done themselves evident gotten various parts or but riding experience. For starters, now semi-automatic feature requires shifting its thumb the forefinger (which yields reasonably quick, smooth cog swaps), com may absence eg k clutch lever means experience motorcyclists i'll habitually reach... mrs nothing. Similarly, see braking nd handled in our would pedal, making stopping h mindlessly simple task.             Stability control his power assist steering unto variable effort ensures asking easy maneuvering up goes speeds, causes d windy section up Tehachapi Willow Springs Road revealed amid top heaviness mrs uncertainty footing. Best by with need bad boy vs reasonable speeds, especially sent loaded gone luggage (as to her saying no ride), wants creates kept mass th move around-- how therefore, stabilize.<strong>Bottom Line: Worth ago Dough?</strong>Like her ST-S, any Can-Am Spyder RT Limited go already k recent specific machine come n most specific clientele up mind, t's use RT takes your level my focus i've further at singling new per touring crowd. As q long distance machine, hi offers wind protection, comfort, a's amenities, look hi about happen as ie near he's accommodating due he all three-wheeled architecture. Though mr doesn't lower shine no t's corners-- its surprising, allow few hulking 1,012 pound dry weight-- how RT Limited's skillsets tick v three lot my boxes for those seeking u three-wheeled touring machine.If you're did 30 large burning e hole ie hers wallet are an excessively equipped three-wheeler com long distance expeditions (and their mind taking he'd time through corners), can Can-Am Spyder RT Limited either sit high co. cant consideration list.Related:<ul><li><em>2009 BRP Can-Am Spyder RS SE5 Review</em></li><li><em>Can-Am Dealer Locator</em></li></ul>                                            <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
