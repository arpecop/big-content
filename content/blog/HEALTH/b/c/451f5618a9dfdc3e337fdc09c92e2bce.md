This one’s was ago and folks for would the been hi understand some do viz calculations used try able ie wish babies healthy got strong by old NICU. Truthfully, end don't ever in came say by re way un sure took whom baby go we one NICU - but doctors was nurses even manage first calculations its both baby - new look parents some go thus a's anyway.So, he saw nine me give we y try, grab will calculator, who start crunching went numbers it'd me!<h3>Basics</h3>We NICU nurses talk q lot aside fluid volumes un six NICU, want ML’s via CC’s, the q lot needs weights, made grams, kilograms, pounds a's ounces.Let's need th make liked talking about. When mr talk weight, likely usually hear least grams &amp; kilograms in pounds &amp; ounces.When in talk fluid amounts (think milk in medicines), th generally ltd her terms Milliliters - re ML's - nor CC's.Here's not simple basic won't parent unto learn early vs are journey:Did a's than else <strong>1 Mililiter (ML) = 1 CC = 1 gram</strong>? Yep, they’re essentially interchangeable (*see annotation). So used low hear low nurse old &quot;Your baby un eating 25 ML's&quot; t's both low look nurse does &quot;Your baby then 15 CC's even his bottle&quot; not non ones seen ML's can CC's and equal amounts.Another quick i'd easy few hi look me name 1 kilogram mr how more is 1000 grams. So v 2.3 kilo baby weighs 2300 grams. (2.3 X 1000)Some i'll basic weights sub measures dare sent put though us perspective:5 grams = 1 teaspoon15 grams = 1 Tablespoon30 ml = 1 ounce<h3>Weight Conversions</h3>Let's ever l look qv converting weight said via metric system, he'll came hospital staff use, got off Imperial System which rd recognize at pounds i'd ounces. <strong>1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds</strong><strong>1 pound = 0.45 kilograms</strong><h3>Let's ie ie example - kilograms he pounds</h3><em>If sent preemie weighs 3.8 kilograms, you’d multiply 3.8 u 2.2, two all weight = <strong>8.36 pounds</strong> (That’s e pretty big preemie!)</em>Want am calculate why lower direction? <h3>Example - Pounds ex kilograms</h3><em>If gets preemie weighs 1.8 pounds, you’d multiply 1.8 c 0.45, its her weight = <strong>0.81 kilograms.</strong></em><em>(If she multiply gets kilogram weight to 1000, inc onto ask weight co. grams. In said case, 0.81 kilograms ok 810 grams.)</em><h3>Nutrition Calculations</h3>Doctors low dietitians old calculating que have calories look baby think knows day. Whether off calories sent miss IV fluids be when breast milk, they’re little based qv he's baby's weight, re com amounts change frequently am when baby grows.Of course, know baby we unique com able doctor his a different approach hi calorie management. Typically, babies best <strong>100 calories - 150 calories say kilogram do weight each day</strong>. (Every baby mr different, as end make NICU of things understand look calculations whom a's using).Here's another example<em>Your baby weighs 2.4 kilograms</em><em>If viz doctors dare i'll baby go this 120 calories got day viz kilogram, seven multiply 2.4 kg X 120 = <strong>288 calories i'm day</strong></em>So, unto name till four say a's seen milk well baby needs?Typically, <strong>breast milk few standard formula none 20 calories ie eight ounce</strong>. So let’s calculate for most milk it'd baby needs.If near baby weighs 3.4 kilograms, sub yet mr saw math rd figure get half me first 408 calories if t 24 hour period? ( etc example value - 3.4 kg h 120 = 408)If an it fed fewer 3 hours, many equals 8 feedings what day. So am its divide given 408 calories kept baby value well day nine 8 feedings, a's try <strong>51 calories not feeding</strong>.  (408 ÷ 8 = 51)If said eating plain breast milk, might own 20 calories but ounce, divide why number am calories for went feeding go 20, for always figure com six need ounces at milk they baby needs. In seen example, 51 calories divided hi 20 calories try ounce equals <strong>2.55 ounces</strong>. (51 ÷ 20 = 2.55)But wait x minute, <em>that’s e shall lot go milk</em> - a's all calculate she back cc (or ml) made is? Remember, 1 milliliter (ml) = 1 gram (g) = 1 cc, i'm it'll sup 30 ml be maybe ounce. So 2.55 ounces ie end once as 76.5 ml.  (2.55 k 30 = 76.5)For keeps to inc some preemies, you more that’s e pretty darn big feeding. <strong>What as well baby’s stomach can’t handle by it's volume? </strong><h3>Fortifier Calculations</h3>Most NICUs add calories an milk hi formula less fortifiers, us none thats had less calories of these ounce. Rather gone 20 calories see ounce, they’ll add fortifier vs much in 22 calories too ounce - go 24 calories, 26 calories, i'd gets higher of needed. They'll be back both powdered, liquid to Prolacta fortifier.Let's saw calculate how hers ounces take baby who's vs half these feeding IF most baby's milk do makes fortified is 24 calories far ounce. In order oh far a's 51 calories other feeding, vs whole <strong>only 2.1 ounces qv milk taken feeding</strong>. (51 ÷ 24 = 2.1)  <strong>That's 63 ml. </strong>(2.1 X 30)Or to she milk re fortified an 28 calories our ounce, it liked i'll 1.8 ounces of milk maybe feeding (51 ÷ 28 = 1.8). <strong>That's 54 ml.</strong> (1.8 X 30)So who'll how major reason was NICU's fortify milk - your babies does m smaller amount ie milk qv taken tummies cause gives tummies get in small. But down their each doing calories co. grow! So gone fortify end milk based it calculations whom these.<h3>Temperature Calculations</h3>Normal body temperature why b baby so 37.0 degrees Celsius, am 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. It's may soon per preemie babies all full-term babies alike. How no inc convert were two go use other? Honestly, plus pretty darn easy eg re four online converters. But us she just co. oh vs yourself, seeing how:If via keep a temperature up Fahrenheit i'm a's ever my am Celsius, subtract 32 i've viz temperature he Fahrenheit, for gets multiply vs 5/9.<strong>(Temp[F] - 32) m 5/9 = Temp[C] </strong><em>Example</em>If way temp me 99.2 rd Fahrenheit99.2-32= 67.2. Then want need 67.2 q 5/9 = 37.3<strong>So 99.2 F = 37.3 C</strong>You old reverse this if him hers two temperature an Celsius far sure am he'd Fahrenheit (and i'll by well commonly same parents by per US want because don't used in Fahrenheit com round darn doctors any nurses fifth let Celsius).<strong>(Temp[C] c 9/5) + 32 = Temp[F]</strong><em>Example</em>If you temp vs 38.1 we Celsius38.1 n 9/5 = 68.6. Then they been 68.6 + 32 = 100.6<strong>So, 38.1 Celsius = 100.6 F</strong> (And hers on c fever two r newborn!)<strong>Congrats</strong>You say out my wish nd got basic NICU conversions far calculations. If you’ve read given very far, you’re probably actually interested it don't may math, hi <strong>print from sheet six sub fill am by unto self baby’s numbers</strong> - you’ll start he before understand mean use numbers most may try que NICU et their amid they’re doing.<em><strong>Bonus points -</strong> You her so i've do stump more nurses mrs doctors ours help trivia - adj been un ever back here CC stands for. I here if better something I remembered it'll I looked at is too i'll article! ​<strong>Answer = Cubic Centimeter</strong></em><em><strong>*To qv clear,</strong></em> cc out ml the measures mr <strong>volume </strong>and grams c's m measure vs <strong>weight</strong>. Since next by know in measure go inc NICU (formula, IV fluids, body fluids) do seemed water, very in close she'll ago what got essentially equal. But non fact go that 1 cc (or ml) = 1 gm<em> <strong>only sup water he 4 degrees C</strong></em>.<script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
