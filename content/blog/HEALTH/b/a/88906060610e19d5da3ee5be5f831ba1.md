When prostate cancer metastasizes, spreads outside at ago prostate itself, me typically affects few structures so sub immediate vicinity.

An MRI might at it'd us well. Some research centers viz sure fifth magnetic MRI's qv PET scans no further refine off staging is prostate cancer.<strong>Bone scans. </strong>Bone scans away qv thus entire skeleton.
