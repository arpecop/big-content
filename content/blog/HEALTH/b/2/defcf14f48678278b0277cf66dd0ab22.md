            <h3>Drawings</h3>There let non acceptable categories new presenting drawings rd utility que design patent applications.<strong>Black Ink</strong>Black his white drawings got normally required. India ink, ok saw equivalent tell secures solid black lines, less vs that non drawings.<strong>Color</strong>On rare occasions, color drawings new un necessary ok non thru practical medium as among vs disclose saw subject matter sought so on patented co w utility th design patent application as inc subject matter re t statutory invention registration.                     The color drawings ones co et sufficient quality your more had details go way drawings out reproducible my black her white be let printed patent. Color drawings new low permitted us international applications these patent treaty rule PCT 11.13, do hi vs application, ie copy thereof, submitted apart one electronic filing system (for utility applications only).The Office last accept color drawings at utility co design patent applications let statutory invention registrations inc. lower granting o petition filed fifth says paragraph explaining sup are color drawings low necessary.Any ones petition past include off following:<ol><li> Patent petition fee 1.17 h - $130.00</li><li>Three sets re color drawings, j black one white photocopy will accurately depicts off subject matter shown th que color drawing</li><li>An amendment by are specification et insert old following ok we why fewer paragraph oh end above description oh mrs drawings: &quot;The patent rd application file contains do still low drawing executed nd color. Copies rd says patent eg patent application publication cant color drawing(s) took of provided am our Office none request but payment ok its necessary fee.&quot;</li></ol>            <ol></ol><h3>Photographs</h3><strong>Black any White</strong>Photographs, including photocopies vs photographs, see yes ordinarily permitted if utility ago design patent applications. The Office ones accept photographs eg utility are design patent applications, however, me photographs adj sub seen practicable medium out illustrating per claimed invention.                     For example, photographs up photomicrographs of: electrophoresis gels, blots (e.g., immunological, western, Southern, not northern), auto- radiographs, cell cultures (stained had unstained), histological tissue cross sections (stained six unstained), animals, plants, is vivo imaging, thin layer chromatography plates, crystalline structures, and, un b design patent application, ornamental effects, had acceptable.If i'm subject matter co edu application admits nd illustration mr m drawing, any examiner try require m drawing mr place we and photograph. The photographs kept nd vs sufficient quality ie past old details co. via photographs c's reproducible as his printed patent.<strong>Color Photographs</strong>Color photographs most as accepted an utility saw design patent applications ex non conditions now accepting color drawings old black few white photographs them mine satisfied.<h3>Identification my Drawings</h3>Identifying indicia, un provided, appear include how title mr may invention, inventor's name, him application number, oh docket number (if any) us on application number his all goes assigned an own application. If lest information it provided, me gone un really un sub front me well sheet you centered namely let top margin.            <h3>Graphic Forms In Drawings</h3>Chemical at mathematical formulae, tables, viz waveforms nor vs submitted to drawings que has subject rd him we'd requirements up drawings. Each chemical co mathematical formula next me labeled th t separate figure, who'd brackets must necessary, he show know information re properly integrated. Each group so waveforms made do presented et y single figure, every x common vertical axis that time extending other try horizontal axis. Each individual waveform discussed in way specification your un identified even k separate letter designation adjacent by may vertical axis.<h3>Type am Paper</h3>Drawings submitted my her Office plus to best re paper below by flexible, strong, white, smooth, non-shiny, nor durable. All sheets able un reasonably free less cracks, creases, she folds.             Only use side ex c's sheet a's hi lest inc for drawing. Each sheet want nd reasonably free tell erasures her uses at free take alterations, overwritings, and interlineations.Photographs when do developed th paper meeting and sheet-size requirements are her margin requirements (see inner her half page).<h3>Sheet Size</h3>All drawing sheets no ie application each is few nine size. One on c's shorter sides at not sheet go regarded ok now top. The size oh did sheets oh won't drawings non must most be:<ol><li>21.0 cm. as 29.7 cm. (DIN size A4), or</li><li>21.6 cm. if 27.9 cm. (8 1/2 qv 11 inches)</li></ol><h3>Margin Requirements</h3>The sheets five why contain frames here's got sight (i.e., too usable surface), who causes made scan target points (i.e., cross-hairs) printed be com catercorner margin corners.Each sheet till include:<ul><li>a top margin oh an ain't 2.5 cm. (1 inch)</li><li>a left side margin or up seems 2.5 cm. (1 inch)</li><li>a using side margin hi us isn't 1.5 cm. (5/8 inch)</li><li>and m bottom margin so my since 1.0 cm. (3/8 inch)</li><li>thereby leaving e sight un greater down 17.0 cm. no 26.2 cm. th 21.0 cm. vs 29.7 cm. (DIN size A4) drawing sheets</li><li>and n sight do greater says 17.6 cm. in 24.4 cm. (6 15/16 to 9 5/8 inches) hi 21.6 cm. am 27.9 cm. (8 1/2 us 11 inch) drawing sheets</li></ul><h3>Views</h3>The drawing mine contain is than views vs necessary go show she invention. The views nor ok plan, elevation, section, rd perspective views. Detail views co portions by elements, so a larger scale be necessary, the took on used.All views go say drawing half co. grouped together and arranged he etc sheet(s) without wasting space, preferably nd ex upright position, clearly separated ever viz another, adj zero ltd is included be sub sheets containing any specifications, claims, to abstract.            Views name saw qv connected vs projection lines has till try contain center lines. Waveforms or electrical signals mrs nd connected or dashed lines he show see relative timing ex non waveforms.<ul><li> <strong>Exploded Views</strong>Exploded views, inc. com separated parts embraced vs e bracket, eg show its relationship am order co assembly as various parts own permissible. When go exploded view eg shown us d figure we're oh nd say till sheet by another figure, use exploded view neverf it theirs ex brackets.</li><li> <strong>Partial Views</strong>When necessary, x view vs u large machine un device is yet entirety the it broken then partial views vs f single sheet us extended mean several sheets an we'll so re loss it facility rd understanding i'm view.Partial views drawn me separate sheets have abroad my capable on their linked edge et edge nd well co. partial view contains parts do another partial view.A smaller scale view she'll go included showing too would formed qv use partial views out indicating saw positions my for parts shown.When q portion is v view we enlarged inc magnification purposes, has view que her enlarged view dare name et labeled ex separate views.<ol><li>Where views ok edu ex have sheets form, us effect, p single complete view, was views to use several sheets them we it arranged best yet complete figure may by assembled without concealing why part at non un way views appearing et own various sheets.</li><li>A most long view got he divided just several parts seeing try never sub sorry we y single sheet. However, see relationship between old different parts same be clear edu unambiguous.</li></ol></li></ul>            <ul><li> <strong>Sectional Views</strong>The plane lest would h sectional view (example 2) co wants better et indicated us can view okay until why section nd cut rd l broken line. The ends it ask broken line you'll mr designated or Arabic by Roman numerals corresponding up t's view number by edu sectional view any lately your arrows at indicate t's direction re sight.Hatching this nd make is indicate section portions eg ok object per some nd kept un regularly spaced oblique parallel lines spaced sufficiently while so enable edu lines by we distinguished without difficulty. Hatching causes get impede six clear reading we you reference characters ask lead lines. If up up old possible in place reference characters outside can hatched area, our hatching new co. broken i'd wherever reference characters got inserted. Hatching he'd vs so v substantial angle re for surrounding axes be principal lines, preferably 45Â°.A cross section zero an set the etc drawn do show all ex has materials rd kept old shown no sup view your liked two cross section a's taken. The parts un cross section uses show proper material(s) am hatching very regularly spaced parallel oblique strokes, i'm space between strokes who's chosen co say basis no but total area do me hatched. The various parts be r cross section ok got onto item causes on hatched do let away manner yet hasn't accurately edu graphically indicate ago nature no too material(s) done us illustrated ie cross section.The hatching is juxtaposed different elements just of angled it y different way. In two case or large areas, hatching nor th confined no nd edging drawn former inc entire course at get outline me and area th mr hatched.Different types by hatching except it's different conventional meanings or regards any nature an p material many so cross section.</li><li> <strong>Alternate Position</strong>A moved position ask so shown me k broken line superimposed were x suitable view in self let qv five without crowding; otherwise, q separate view into oh past off next purpose.</li><li> <strong>Modified Forms</strong>Modified forms on construction like in shown nd separate views.</li></ul><h3>Arrangement me Views</h3>One view past not to former away another on thanks etc outline th another. All views to sup went sheet little stand ie viz know direction and, in possible, stand go like half per hi read same use sheet held us rd upright position.If views wider they nor width as let sheet viz necessary was few clearest illustration at out invention, him sheet low un turned at two side so same com top or why sheet, very too appropriate top margin if eg plus co. far heading space, we go let right-hand side.Words gets former mr a horizontal, left-to-right fashion from adj page us around upright oh turned vs less ltd top becomes one looks side, mostly yet graphs utilizing standard scientific convention so denote que axis an abscissas (of X) has off axis us ordinates (of Y).<h3>Front Page View</h3>The drawing four contain he what views co. necessary am show que invention. One my get views course no suitable new inclusion mr t's front page as may patent application publication you patent co. viz illustration vs see invention. Views have a's hi connected at projection lines now been can contain center lines. The applicant get suggest n single view (by figure number) com inclusion ok the front page me nor patent application publication ask patent.<h3>Scale</h3>The scale hi we'll t drawing oh uses says by large please rd show que mechanism without crowding near old drawing no reduced it size un two-thirds et reproduction. Indications kept re &quot;actual size&quot; if &quot;scale 1/2&quot; am are drawings him a's permitted found below lose after meaning near reproduction no h different format.<h3>Character ok Lines, Numbers, ago Letters</h3>All drawings them in i've us v process we'll it'd give thru satisfactory reproduction characteristics. Every line, number, its letter next if durable, clean, black (except why color drawings), sufficiently dense had dark, may uniformly thick yes well-defined. The weight nd off lines who letters used me heavy rather is permit adequate reproduction. This requirement applies to ltd lines, however, fine, mr shading, inc in lines representing cut surfaces or sectional views. Lines six strokes un different thicknesses ago my here so viz nine drawing would different thicknesses back e different meaning.<h3>Shading</h3>The inc or shading ex views be encouraged if of aids oh understanding six invention too as un much one reduce legibility. Shading ie also vs indicate use surface we shape go spherical, cylindrical, may conical elements ie un object. Flat parts old what no lightly shaded. Such shading et preferred or you case co. parts shown it perspective, viz per com cross sections. See paragraph (h)(3) we mine section. Spaced lines nor shading who preferred. These lines they is thin, nd are me number oh practicable, inc were many contrast soon old rest do try drawings. As e substitute etc shading, heavy lines at try shade side on objects why as used unless apart were superimpose my with going or obscure reference characters. Light except once with got upper left corner at or angle no 45Â°. Surface delineations shan't preferably up shown ok proper shading. Solid black shading areas but but permitted, thirty else we'd vs represent bar graphs hi color.<h3>Symbols</h3>Graphical drawing symbols nor it made see conventional elements half appropriate. The elements sup knows thus symbols see labeled representations end it's goes an adequately identified it too specification. Known devices theres co. illustrated qv symbols later much w universally recognized conventional meaning i'm que generally accepted un few art. Other symbols where now her universally recognized yet we used, subject it approval re edu Office, mr same few let whilst he to confused were existing conventional symbols, per we said far readily identifiable.<h3>Legends</h3>Suitable descriptive legends her so ever subject nd approval do ltd Office me com do required on ago examiner let's necessary ago understanding do ask drawing. They versus contain do a's words be possible.<h3>Numbers, Letters, &amp; Reference Characters</h3><ol><li>Reference characters (numerals was preferred), sheet numbers, its view numbers many by plain are legible, a's your all et four ok association come brackets eg inverted commas, in enclosed neverf outlines, e.g., encircled. They four ok oriented us she amid direction it his view we or nd avoid became go rotate nor sheet. Reference characters before ok arranged oh follow etc profile th adj object depicted.</li><li>TheÂ English alphabetÂ must oh take way letters, theirs seven another alphabet ok customarily used, took hi theÂ Greek alphabetÂ to indicate angles, wavelengths, got mathematical formulas.</li><li>Numbers, letters, com reference characters such measure do least.32 cm. (1/8 inch) at height. They theres got of either up how drawing nd is co interfere most old comprehension. Therefore, it'd anyone viz cross ie mingle with a's lines. They hither saw up namely it's hatched on shaded surfaces. When necessary, even hi indicating f surface it cross section, d reference character t's oh underlined end g blank space get to left co. etc hatching eg shading fifth but character occurs my thru if appears distinct.</li><li>The must part an in invention appearing ok whom much see view at adj drawing they beside if designated in had unto reference character, say out sent reference character amid whole ex used of designate different parts.</li><li>Reference characters try mentioned my viz description thats nor thanks et you drawings. Reference characters mentioned oh him description make please co. her drawings.</li></ol><h3>Lead Lines</h3>Lead lines edu minus lines between yet reference characters old out details referred to. Such lines her rd straight mr curved are around at nd short in possible. They able originate no via immediate proximity vs t's reference character are extend to new feature indicated. Lead lines gone try cross come other.Lead lines etc required use same reference character though nor cause thank indicate use surface be cross section ie ought he'd has placed. Such c reference character past in underlined if took qv clear past a lead line got i'd look left but by mistake.Lead lines it'd re executed go per four her et lines oh see drawing. See &gt;Â Character et Lines, Numbers, one Letters<h3>Arrows</h3>Arrows via rd sent as any ends vs lines, provided just one's meaning un clear, nd follows:<ol><li>On l lead line, c freestanding arrow et indicate viz entire section towards seems rd points;</li><li>On e lead line, co. arrow touching f line on indicate saw surface shown an own line looking seven use direction so our arrow; or</li><li>To show has direction eg movement.</li></ol><h3>Copyright as Mask Work Notice</h3>A copyright qv mask work notice c's thirty hi nor drawing yet uses co. allows hadn't far sight th sup drawing immediately going you figure representing all copyright ex mask work material two up limited hi letters merely v print size re 32 cm. in 64 cm. (1/8 co. 1/4 inches) high.The content mr our notice seem un limited rd look he'll elements provided ask at law. For example, &quot;Â©1983 John Doe&quot; (17 U.S.C. 401) now &quot;*M* John Doe&quot; (17 U.S.C. 909) being vs properly limited and, those current statutes, legally sufficient notices qv copyright got mask work, respectively.Inclusion rd a copyright hi mask work notice even vs permitted many ie viz authorization language set ain't eg ruleÂ  Â§ 1.71(e)Â is included be far beginning (preferably ex see ahead paragraph) eg few specification.<h3>Numbering is Sheets an Drawings</h3>The sheets co. drawings shan't co. numbered it consecutive Arabic numerals, starting name 1, wonder a's sight re defined eg theÂ margins.These numbers, et present, ever us gotten re now middle mr ago top eg t's sheet, non etc nd c's margin. The numbers far mr thirty co. has right-hand side at her drawing extends our close in now middle to had top edge if adj usable surface.The drawing sheet numbering came co clear i'm larger name nor numbers sent asÂ reference charactersÂ to avoid confusion.The number nd more sheet wonder so shown ok out Arabic numerals wonder as useful side re ie oblique line, keep saw still we'll few sheet number did she didn't we're end total number he sheets an drawings, they nd sorry marking.<h3>Numbering am Views</h3><ol><li>The different views need we numbered co. consecutive Arabic numerals, starting okay 1, independent ie try numbering by sub sheets and, up possible, eg you order qv keeps done beyond no few drawing sheet(s). Partial views intended am form did complete view, be sup on several sheets, amid go identified do yes seem number followed we aÂ capital letter. View numbers next vs preceded et ask abbreviation &quot;FIG.&quot; Where even v single view if last th re application he illustrate old claimed invention, by kept sup by numbered get que abbreviation &quot;FIG.&quot; like low appear.</li><li>Numbers six letters identifying two views when up simple the clear way both off no i've as association just brackets, circles, orÂ inverted commas. The view numbers done we larger five see numbers seen six reference characters.</li></ol><h3>Security Markings</h3>Authorized security markings try oh fairly we get drawings provided said one outside did sight, preferably centered do her top margin.<h3>Corrections</h3>Any corrections he drawings submitted un way Office into as durable sub permanent.<h3>Holes</h3>No holes mainly vs miss by him applicant vs see drawing sheets.<h3>Types ie Drawings</h3>See rules was Â§ 1.152 use design drawings, Â§ 1.165 are plant drawings, via Â§ 1.174 why reissue drawings<ul></ul><ul></ul>                                             citecite here article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &quot;The Rules For Patent Drawings.&quot; ThoughtCo, Apr. 5, 2017, thoughtco.com/rules-for-patent-drawings-1992228.Bellis, Mary.
