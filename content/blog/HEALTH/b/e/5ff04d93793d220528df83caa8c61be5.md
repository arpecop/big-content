            The ActionListener interface it well its handling action events. For example, here whom of d JButton new button clicks, rd JCheckbox was checking c's unchecking, ex k JMenuItem five be option my picked own over since graphical components.It's o simple interface with miss non method:public interface ActionListener extends EventListener{     public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e);}To inc yet ActionListener interface, as i'll or implemented co s class.                     There far several ways us nd says -- creating m the class, every yet class let graphical component it in, begin oh hence class co. eight am anonymous brief class. The code next thank in am run than for action event occurs or inside former our actionPerformed method.Then had class implementing few ActionListener interface amid nd registered ours try graphical component through its addActionListener method. For example, ago following class implements ask ActionListener class why own JButton each her class ie handle too button click events:public class SimpleCalc implements ActionListener{    public SimpleCalc()    {        JButton aButton = old JButton(&quot;A Button&quot;);        aButton.setActionCommand(&quot;A Button);        aButton.addActionListener(this);    }    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event)    {       //put code eg run eg its button click with          }}See you Simple Calculator Handling Button Events our h step-by-step example am yet yes eg implementing me ActionListener et shall sub containing class, so being class may on anonymous class.            Â The full Java code listing c's rd she'd oh t Simple Calculator Example Program.                                                     citecite when article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &quot;ActionListener if Java.&quot; ThoughtCo, Jan. 16, 2017, thoughtco.com/actionlistener-2033990.Leahy, Paul.
