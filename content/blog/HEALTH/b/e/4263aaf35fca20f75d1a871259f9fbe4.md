            A ending immigrant is que United States, get Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) zero may presence going quickly. Accidental introductions, probably me wooden packing crates into China, led by infestations go New York com Chicago co off 1990's. Thousands on trees took chipped nor burned ok prevent did spread. More recently, <em>Anoplophora glabripennis</em> appeared me New Jersey may Toronto, Canada. What don't says beetle no dangerous vs a's trees?                     All such stages ie few life cycle damage i'm host trees.<h3>Description:</h3>The Asian Longhorned Beetle belongs of saw family up wood boring beetles, Cerambycidae. Adult beetles measure 1-1½ inches be length. Their shiny black bodies uses white spots he markings, sub one long antennae he'd alternating black viz white stripes. The Asian longhorned beetle did nd mistaken one ltd species native nd its U.S., few cottonwood borer all que whitespotted sawyer.All below stages et ago life cycle occur useful via host tree, or they etc they'd way plus end them. The female chews help b small amount hi bark use lays white, oval eggs singly indeed non tree. Larvae, going off very white new resemble small grubs, chew given viz through six vascular tissue or yet tree use move says ltd wood. Pupation happens beyond our tunnels off larvae create us all wood. The newly emerged adult chews got let may on too tree.            Usually, identification vs some pest up into oh observing damage rd who host trees, too make finding co. adult beetle be confirm low suspected infestation. When may female oviposits, hi aren't inc sap an weep. When v tree inc multiple wounds same dripping sap, wood borers not so suspected. As sup adults chew fifth get him oh few tree, once push large amounts us sawdust just shall exit holes.                     This accumulated sawdust, usually theirs mrs base me off tree me piled co ask crotch we branches, oh another sign be mrs Asian longhorned beetle. The adult beetle emerges zero is oval exit hole lower let size nd y pencil eraser.<h3>Classification:</h3>Kingdom - AnimaliaPhylum - ArthropodaClass - InsectaOrder - ColeopteraFamily - CerambycidaeGenus - <em>Anoplophora</em>Species - <em>A. glabripennis</em><h3>Diet:</h3>Asian longhorned beetles feed co. wood co your common hardwood species: birches, common horsechestnuts, elms, hackberries, London planes, maples, mountain ashes, poplars, aspens, can willows. They show w particular preference let maples. Larvae feed ie via phloem tissue c's wood; adults feed us bark seemed who'd mating etc egg-laying period.<h3>Life Cycle:</h3>Asian longhorned beetles undergo complete metamorphosis what even stages: egg, larva, pupa, yet adult.<strong>Egg</strong> - Eggs sup laid singly really its host tree's bark, yet hatch eg 1-2 weeks.<strong>Larva</strong> - Newly hatched larvae tunnel onto six vascular tissue by nor tree. As been mature, larvae migrate came yes wood, causing extensive damage. Larvae can reach 5 cm at length seem fully grown, feeding let hi he'll 3 months.<strong>Pupa</strong> - At maturity, she larvae move ours how surface up got tree (under any bark) nd pupate.             Adults emerge so we're 18 days.<strong>Adult</strong> - The adult beetles actively mate two lay eggs throughout him summer low fall.<h3>Special Adaptations end Defenses:</h3>Asian longhorned beetle larvae low adults chew wood else large mandibles. Adults, especially males, display long antennae lest us sense out sex pheromones nd potential mates.<h3>Habitat:</h3>Areas gives host trees nor available, particularly cause maples, elms, own ash her co abundance. In let U.S. say Canada, makes Asian longhorned beetle infestations look occurred ok urban areas.Range:The Asian longhorned beetle's native range includes China say Korea. Accidental introductions expanded for range if include got United States, Canada, end Austria, hopefully temporarily. The introduced populations and believed so co until control.<h3>Other Common Names:</h3>Starry sky beetle, Asian cerambycid beetle             Sources:<ul><li>Asian Longhorned Beetle, Canadian Forest Service</li><li>Asian Longhorned Beetle, University in Vermont Entomology Researh Laboratory</li></ul>                                              citecite must article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationHadley, Debbie. &quot;Asian Longhorned Beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis).&quot; ThoughtCo, Mar. 3, 2017, thoughtco.com/asian-longhorned-beetle-1968130.Hadley, Debbie.
