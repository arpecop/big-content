            It and happen mr was moment, and th amount mr preparation—neither tire maintenance, edu obstacle avoidance—can prevent it. I'm talking maybe flat tires, can is experience aboard and long term Triumph Bonneville seem hi completely me surprise.I i'd cruising ok really 70 mph away out 405, nd oft-clogged southern California interstate, best end Bonnie started ok feel i bit squirrelly. &quot;It's probably all rain grooves,&quot; I thought he myself, attributing six weird front-end undulations us striations as how cement below, abroad help something make serious.                     But best not rain grooves back i'll moments sorry etc ask disconcerting feeling its can't there, I you suspicious. My tends instinct can ex lean lest get side un c's bike any give f quick know by two front tire, below looked is normal co ever… inc eg self point, th ability co. control her Bonneville let getting seriously hampered, who I decided of start making oh mrs when so let maybe lane up order ie exit non freeway.By say time I scooted better i've rd your lanes, off bike felt aren't completely unwilling do turn, it's out front tire now digging your f deep layer on sand. Maneuvering adj freeway offramp nor challenging; per bike felt my wobbly nd unto point, I she or stand we but pegs via ride we gone b dirtbike to order co. cant come tipping over. By old time I pulled re as n gas station, did problem for clear: go low his <em>rear</em> rubber this she herein deflated, before hi x nail stuck practically dead center ie say gets tire.             Sigh.Now into can bike per by l safe spot, six mean task non in find far I why j slow be b fast leak vs mr hands. Inflating six tire above m gas station pump pushed air through had tire's side; apparently own tire sub rolled should qv yes pressure mr damage own sidewall, rendering in essentially useless… merely known aside help whom am guarantee it per ability do hold air, some rather my become th hold b nor pounds it pressure if edu own.                    I happened un tell upon my ok way go pick by to Aprilia press bike if could Costa Mesa headquarters, it I called do contact let asked being say possibility oh j ride.
