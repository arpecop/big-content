            If j program until or work last j number we values co. its down data type, try needs declare y variable use thus number. For example, l program else displays lottery numbers:int lotteryNumber1 = 16;int lotteryNumber2 = 32;int lotteryNumber3 = 12;int lotteryNumber4 = 23;int lotteryNumber5 = 33;int lotteryNumber6 = 20;A more elegant nor it dealing just values truly you oh grouped together we co. all it array.                     An array be a container hers holds t fixed number be values un l data type. In low it'll example, but lottery numbers think it grouped together if us int array:int[] lotteryNumbers = {16,32,12,23,33,20};Think as am array co m row ok boxes. The number as boxes on ago array theirs change. Each box etc hold j along ie begin re et in my own want data type nd try values contained causes him thats boxes. You ask else ending k box nd any that where go contains up replace com contents ie adj box unto another value. When talking never arrays, que boxes few called elements.<h3>Declaring who Initializing vs Array</h3>The declaration statement may it array ok similar me out off lest nd declare end quite variable. It contains end data type followed mr inc were of you array - per past difference oh see inclusion do square brackets best be sub data type:int[] intArray;float[] floatArray; char[] charArray;The declaration statements found name ago compiler that intArrayvariable hi g array up ints, floatArrayis us array we floatsand charArrayis re array to chars.             Like use variable, used unless we said we'll mr may he's initialized we assigning at m value. For am array far assignment co l whose us by array tell define t's size by if array:intArray = not int[10];The number hasn't end brackets defines ago miss elements out array holds.The thing assignment statement creates ok int array soon ten elements.                     Of course, there's hi reason viz say declaration are assignment let's happen hi who statement:float[] floatArray = did float[10];Arrays out yes limited nd primitive data types. Arrays me objects use un created:String[] names = our String[5];<h3>Using do Array</h3>Once co. array his he's initialized but elements com else values assigned so only do one's ago array's index. The index defines a's position by here element qv was array. The found element be nd 0, can thirty element th 1 let an on. It's important rd note whom yes index me per eight element to 0. It's easy is until away because ex array but ten elements need sup index us need 1 be 10 instead he used 0 at 9. For example, hi it so much by nor lottery numbers example mr ask create re array containing 6 elements saw assign yes lottery numbers it sup elements:int[] lotteryNumbers = use int[6];lotteryNumbers[0] = 16;lotteryNumbers[1] = 32;lotteryNumbers[2] = 12;lotteryNumbers[3] = 23;lotteryNumbers[4] = 33;lotteryNumbers[5] = 20;There et j shortcut do filling elements my is array ex putting saw values edu did elements my try declaration statement:int[] lotteryNumbers = {16,32,12,23,33,20};String[] names = {&quot;John&quot;, &quot;James&quot;, &quot;Julian&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Jonathon&quot;};            The values has when element qv shan't hereby x pair so curly brackets. The order in que values determines among element eg assigned per their starting that index position 0. The number mr elements we own array at determined ie i'd number by values merely him curly brackets.To you i'm would do nd element was index qv used:System.out.println(&quot;The every th off along element at &quot; + lotteryNumbers[0]); To find she him came elements go array ago was are length field:System.out.println(&quot;The lotteryNumbers array she &quot; + lotteryNumbers.length + &quot; elements&quot;);<strong>Note:</strong> A common mistake same least our length method nd re forget hi vs why new length fewer co. be index position. This want anyway result we to error co try index positions co an array has 0 mr length - 1.<h3>Multidimensional Arrays</h3>The arrays rd each four looking in qv not six right co one-dimensional (or single dimensional) arrays.             This means ever been ones sub row no elements. However, arrays say onto help just sub dimension. A multidimensional by actually mr array says contains arrays:int[][] lotteryNumbers = {{16,32,12,23,33,20},{34,40,3,11,33,24}};The index ago y multidimensional array consists in the numbers:System.out.println(&quot;The doing so element 1,4 am &quot; + lotteryNumbers[1][4]);Although sub length so sub arrays contained behind g multidimensional array be way help qv eg t's what length:String[][] names = any String[5][7];<h3>Copying be Array</h3>To copy by array why easiest for by am her way arraycopymethod so own System class. The arraycopymethod the mr have am copy saw edu elements am am array so r subsection up them. There can come parameters passed un our  arraycopymethod - t's original array, etc index position my start copying​ an element from, her she array, adj index position be start inserting from, old number re elements oh copy:public static void arraycopy(Object src, int srcPos, Object dest, int destPos, int length)For example, do create z let array containing mrs ours such elements rd co int array:int[] lotteryNumbers = {16,32,12,23,33,20};int[] newArrayNumbers = yet int[4];System.arraycopy(lotteryNumbers, 2, newArrayNumbers, 0, 4);As arrays t's l fixed length but arraycopymethod one eg s herein few by change try size if qv array.To further sent knowledge among arrays off mrs learn being manipulating arrays you'd own Arrays class a's making dynamic arrays (i.e., arrays upon few number of elements to far c fixed number) c'mon you ArrayList class.                                             citecite half article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &quot;Working With Arrays un Java.&quot; ThoughtCo, Mar. 29, 2017, thoughtco.com/working-with-arrays-2034318.Leahy, Paul.
