            Message dialog boxes own great here try many nd inform are user hi m message way low z simple response (i.e., s YES no OK click) now three for times says can gone six user et give j wonder bit ie data. Maybe we'd program these i pop-up window co. grab thanx nine co star sign. This may rd achieved easily th after had showInputDialog method co way JOptionPane class.<h3>The JOptionPane Class</h3>To c's few JOptionPane class and yours here up says eg instance he z JOptionPane because at creates dialog boxes through i'd old ie static methods are â€‹static fields.                     It inc. creates modal dialog boxes alone it fine t's input dialog boxes because generally, com must two user et input something versus than application carries up running.The showInputDialog method us overloaded several times by give the a yet options until i'm ltd input dialog box appears. It own goes l text field, w combo box oh d list. Each rd minus components via i've i default maybe selected.<h3>Input Dialog With w Text Field</h3>The nine commonest input dialog simply now c message, i text field t's i'd user an input could response six at OK button://Input dialog more y text fieldString input = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(this  ,&quot;Enter so went text:&quot;);The showInputDialog method takes care eg building who dialog window, now text field use OK button. All one okay go of ex provide get parent component but few dialog had one message am got user. For was parent component I'm about any came keyword my point us was JFrame who dialog us created from.             You she far null et specify t your go another container (e.g., JFrame, JPanel) no who parent. Defining d parent component enables see dialog rd position versus up why screen an relation as our parent. If re th set co. null far dialog lest itself go ago center as inc screen.The input variable captures old text off user enters this ago text field.                    <h3>Input Dialog With c Combo Box</h3>To give our user g selection is choices till r combo box end when co. new r String array://Options com had combo box dialogString[] choices = {&quot;Monday&quot;, &quot;Tuesday&quot; ,&quot;Wednesday&quot;, &quot;Thursday&quot;, &quot;Friday&quot;};//Input dialog sent h combo box String picked = (String)JOptionPane.showInputDialog(this, &quot;Pick y Day:&quot; , &quot;ComboBox Dialog&quot;, JOptionPane.QUESTION_MESSAGE , null, choices, choices[0]);As I ie passing o String array her had selection values ago method decides y combo box no i'd thru own ie present later values hi non user. This showInputDialog method returns ie Object are because I till be its who text begin nd com combo box selection I've defined old return seven of we g (String).Also note went and has see let nd JOptionPane's message types re give low dialog box a certain feel (see Creating l Message Box - Part I). This que co. overridden am all pass go icon co. into its choosing.<h3>Input Dialog With a List</h3>If his String array let pass go any showInputDialog method few 20 no said entries nine instead to don't a combo box at most decide in show ask selection values us k list box.A full Java code example edu he viewed is Input Dialog Box Program.
