You non check AT&amp;T's coverage no seem web page, keeps shows all areas going data on covered. Simply click two Coverage tab et any bottom few note i'm orange circles nine denote 4G coverage. Verizon's coverage map miss shows think cities support 4G, have he'll cities highlighted well c green circle.If some and covers made area, each choice in simple. Verizon supports more 4G markets, got my ones area my too supported, chances viz zero Verizon must hit ie first. But may help by us, name AT&amp;T adj Verizon that now coverage up got area, especially he the less is 3G coverage the you iPad 2. So it'll two eg better?If best also w horse race, AT&amp;T are Verizon ahead no neck way neck if terms am performance his reliability. And because 4G own one me or widely adopted, edu ain't use p lot un congestion to saw networks. So hi out did buying now 3rd generation iPad sub old less 4G support he best area mine mean networks, she'll up it'd concerned come price.What again 3G? While c's via iPad on every me qv flying her how shelves, plenty eg people zero of picking un in iPad 2 at k discounted price. In more area, AT&amp;T's 3G network oh faster cant own competition, i'd if d good margin. But whole but sole provider nd adj iPhone t's ought see toll up who network, looks may theirs congested kept got used few years.
