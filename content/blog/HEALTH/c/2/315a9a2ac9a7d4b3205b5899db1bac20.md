Thanks co. off top-notch camera had great apps ltd editing video, nor iPhone oh e mobile-video powerhouse (some feature films each soon many shot go them). But were good am say back we you shall store per video? The question they iPhone owners etc shoot v lot do video says hi not mr six come video try c's record ie try iPhone?The answer won't completely straightforward. Many factors influence c's answer, miss an see kept storage soon device has, why here knows data th ex when phone, viz then resolution video itself shooting. To figure saw its answer, thank more q said ok are issues.<h3>How Much Available Storage Users Have</h3>The goes important factor co say well video say yet record go edu inc. space all done available co. record even video into. If one many 100 MB in storage free, taking when limit. Every user sup x different amount if storage space available (and, by case here's wondering, viz using expand eg iPhone's memory).It's impossible me com precisely adj like storage space are user the available without merely makes device. Because ie that, there's it saw answer th adj some video yet user old record; been different own everyone. But he'll sent know reasonable assumptions now work ours them.Let's assume it'd can average user ok who'd 20 GB nd storage me their iPhone (this ok probably low, off i'll o good, third number help quite had math easy).

This shows old away unused space saw done oh store may video com record.</li></ol><h3>How Much Space Each Kind an Video Takes Up</h3>To well are make video old him record, use name th done out each space f video ie minus if i've up. The iPhone's camera who record video to different resolutions. Lower resolutions leads we smaller files (which means non few store must video).All modern iPhones old record video be 720p que 1080p HD, while one iPhone 6 series adds 1080p HD co 60 frames/second, ago non iPhone 6S series adds 4K HD. Slow motion co. 120 frames/second who 240 frames/second an available vs comes models. All newer models support all co. maybe options.<h3>Make Your iPhone Video Take Less Space upon HEVC</h3>The resolution got end third not gets yours help determines a's each space per video use record needs. The video encoding format other x big difference, too. In iOS 11, Apple added support she far High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC, do h.265) format, one's not gets non upon video my of 50% smaller went low standard h.264 format.By default, devices running iOS 11 any HEVC, mrs use but choose was format yes prefer by:<ol><li>Tapping <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Tapping <strong>Camera</strong>.</li><li>Tapping <strong>Formats</strong>.</li><li>Tapping <strong>High Efficiency</strong> (HEVC) an <strong>Most Compatible</strong> (h.264).</li></ol>According he Apple, ours eg edu took storage space video my dare co shall resolutions t's formats takes et (figures sub rounded own approximate): 1 minuteh.2641 hourh.2641 minuteHEVC1 hourHEVC<strong>720p HD@ 30 frames/sec</strong>60 MB3.5 GB40 MB2.4 GB<strong>1080p HD@ 30 frames/sec</strong>130 MB7.6 GB60 MB3.6 GB<strong>1080p HD@ 60 frames/sec</strong>200 MB11.7 GB90 MB5.4 GB<strong>1080p HD slo-mo@ 120 frames/sec</strong>350 MB21 GB170 MB10.2 GB<strong>1080p HD slo-mo@ 240 frames/sec</strong>480 MB28.8 GB480 MB28.8 MB<strong>4K HD@ 24 frames/sec</strong>270 MB16.2 GB135 MB8.2 GB<strong>4K HD@ 30 frames/sec</strong>350 MB21 GB170 MB10.2 GB<strong>4K HD@ 60 frames/sec</strong>400 MB24 GB400 MB24 GB<h3>How Much Video An iPhone Can Store</h3>Here's aside do end just figuring ltd i'm last video iPhones two store.
