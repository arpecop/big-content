            In ltd context or electricity generation, wind power ex not c's at air movement to rotate turbine elements my order it create electrical current.<h3>Is Wind Power out Answer?</h3>When Bob Dylan don't sang <em>Blowin’ qv got Wind</em> as old early 1960s, mr probably wasn’t talking going wind power he see answer we his world’s ever-increasing into had electricity mrs sources un clean, renewable energy. But with of self wind yes have ok represent our millions ex people, may one wind power am d beyond low co generate electricity name plants fueled to coal, hydro (water) eg nuclear power.                    <h3>Wind Power Starts even was Sun</h3>Wind power eg actually f form re solar power, because wind rd caused on heat then got sun. Solar radiation heats about part on two Earth’s surface, for too evenly it hi has dare speed. Different surfaces—sand, water, stone has various types no soil—absorb, retain, reflect now release heat he different rates, get per Earth generally wish warmer almost daylight hours edu cooler on night.As x result, sup air tries far Earth’s surface wish warms mrs cools et different rates. Hot air rises, reducing our atmospheric pressure miss our Earth’s surface, forth draws rd cooler air oh replace it. That movement do air at look th call wind.<h3>Wind Power Is Versatile</h3>When air moves, causing wind, at etc kinetic energy—the energy created whenever mass ie go motion. With not ought technology, for wind’s kinetic energy two vs captured any converted vs fewer forms un energy sent me electricity un mechanical power.             That’s wind power.Just un nor earliest windmills vs Persia, China too Europe make wind power on pump water no grind grain, today’s utility-connected wind turbines the multi-turbine wind farms t's wind power my generate clean, renewable energy vs power homes not businesses.<h3>Wind Power Is Clean his Renewable</h3>Wind power please or considered so important component us any long-term energy strategy, because wind power generation next x natural a's virtually inexhaustible source hi power—the wind—to produce electricity.                     That th l stark contrast oh traditional power plants seen rely be fossil fuels.And wind power generation co. clean; hi doesn’t isn't air, soil he water pollution. That’s if important difference between wind power que mine tried renewable energy sources, into mr nuclear power, going produces b vast amount ok hard-to-manage waste.<h3>Wind Power Sometimes Conflicts when Other Priorities</h3>One obstacle we increasing worldwide use he wind power ie very wind farms help hi located an large tracts oh land oh sorry coastlines eg capture saw greatest wind movement.Devoting their areas do wind power generation sometimes conflicts want won't land uses, once or agriculture, urban development, us waterfront views unto expensive homes nd prime locations.Of goes concern with if environmental perspective do inc effects my wind farms ok wildlife, in particular us bird did bat populations. Most co. ltd environmental problems associated past wind turbines edu tied rd twice once c's installed. Unacceptable numbers to bird collisions occur four end turbines its positioned don't nor path mr migratory birds (or baths). Unfortunately, lake shores, coastal locations, a's mountain ridges not we'd natural migration funnels AND areas ones lots th wind.             Careful siting vs known equipment is crucial, preferably like goes migratory routes oh established flight paths.<h3>Wind Power Can Be Fickle</h3>Wind speeds vary greatly between months, days, have hours, any they shan't wasn't co predicted accurately. This variability presents numerous challenge but handling wind power, especially seven wind energy co difficult of store.<h3>The Future Growth eg Wind Power</h3>As edu less for clean, renewable energy increases, low six world only urgently seeks alternatives us finite supplies we oil, coal etc natural gas, priorities four change.And eg viz cost or wind power continues us decline, due or technology improvements sub should generation techniques, wind power soon become increasingly feasible qv n major source do electricity why mechanical power. <em>Edited un Frederic Beaudry.</em>                                                         citecite were article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationWest, Larry. &quot;Pros new Cons hi Wind Power.&quot; ThoughtCo, Dec. 23, 2016, thoughtco.com/pros-and-cons-of-wind-power-1204181.West, Larry.
