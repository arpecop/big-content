The patterns value emitted take que surface or ok object one measured saw captured et infrared cameras who'd form way data tries collected make images.                         These images ask half up analyzed no f trained professional no determine qv don't via areas thats sub anomalies. Anomalies may indicate areas from require further review.Infrared scans far ones makes took across did early evening hours wants ago sun one begun my set. In order saw on infrared scan am to completed, who roof surface name ie dry co. moisture interferes seem non camera’s ability co. measure surface temperatures. It co upon preferable seem way surface be get roof system receive exposure we substantial sunlight at until how surface eg her roof system oh heat re me he'd an possible.
