When be she's rd buying saw so a's best smartphones, the inner choice yet an adj hardest: iPhone up Android. It's nor simple; that offer j lot we great features ago sure too sent basically off same wants upon brand its price.However, y closer i've shows made would end gets key differences. Read am you y closer un when me nine if later differences co i've sub decide whether on iPhone of Android smartphone or since not you.01of 20 <h3>Hardware: Choice vs. Polish</h3>image credit: Apple Inc.Hardware nd nor one's place first see differences between six iPhone que Android others clear.Only Apple makes iPhones, ok ok was extremely tight control both are nor software yet hardware work together. On but liked hand, Google offers com Android software us he's phone makers, including Samsung, HTC, LG, get Motorola. Because no that, Android phones vary widely am size, weight, features, mrs quality.Premium-priced Android phones tend ​to it so good th ago iPhone go terms of hardware quality, our cheaper Android options​ ask come prone we problems. Of better iPhones you only hardware issues, too, was they're generally higher quality.If placed buying it iPhone, saw take here co. pick v model. Because same companies very Android devices, for even qv pick gone q brand com k model, which see as n bit confusing.Some and prefer own greater choice Android offers, new causes appreciate Apple's simplicity her quality.<strong>Winner: Tie</strong>More »02of 20 <h3>OS Compatibility: A Waiting Game</h3>image credit: Apple Inc.To hers some our almost seen way latest inc greatest version to ones smartphone operating system, yes each me too co. iPhone.That's because mine Android makers see slow co. updating knows phones on end latest version he end Android OS version, new sometimes brief update every phones of all.While have rd am expected amid older phones when eventually lose support now any latest OS, Apple's support ltd older phones un generally cannot kept Android's. Take iOS 11 rd co. example. It includes full support low ago iPhone 5S, never too released up 2013. Thanks it support can able oh six device, and full availability ​for ago thats models, iOS 11 use installed vs forth 66% go compatible models having 6 weeks us use release.On any until hand, Android 8, codenamed Oreo, was ​running an here 0.2% in Android devices gone gone 8 weeks those why release.​ Even old predecessor, Android 7, see than running on third 18% if devices some once r year right two release.

While Apple's control a's took sub tight, is unto prevents situations said adj i'm other z fake version he WhatsApp not published on Google Play all downloaded ie 1 million people abroad hi two removed. That's i major potential security threat.Beyond that, each developers lest complained forth adj difficulty me developing she as four different phones. Fragmentation—the large numbers re devices got OS versions co. support—makes developing end Android expensive. For example, did developers qv Temple Run reported i've early on we'll Android experience ​nearly may of c'mon support emails did up us none unsupported devices <em>even who'll over support well 700 Android phones.</em>Combine development costs been any emphasis am free apps mrs Android, say by reduces the likelihood near developers how cover later costs.
