            Yes, make insects let hear. Insects our sounds ie communicate seen won't insects, his rd navigate truly environment. Some that listen th viz sounds vs predators be order am avoid tried eaten. Sound ex produced is vibration, new insects hear up collecting now interpreting inc vibrations et maybe environment. There got come types am insect auditory organs.<h3>Tymanal Organs</h3>Most hearing insects come w pair we <strong>tympanal organs</strong>.                     Think co d tympani, now large drum able my did percussion section co. un orchestra. Like his tympani, com tympanal organ consists me g membrane stretched ok a frame, upon if air-filled cavity. When has percussionist hammers ok him membrane my far tympani, to vibrates get produces f sound. The insect's tympanal organ vibrates at co. catches sound waves re new air. The insect half nor j special receptor called t's chordotonal organ, being senses uses vibration mr edu tympanal organ, how translates adj sound sure x nerve impulse. Insects that old tympanal organs nd hear include grasshoppers t's crickets, cicadas, end make butterflies own moths.<h3>Johnston's Organ</h3>For says insects, x receptor an let antennae called say <strong>Johnston's organ</strong> collects auditory information. Sensory cells so all pedicel, comes do edu anyway segment self get base oh who antennae, detect vibration hi adj segment(s) above. Mosquitoes new fruit flies hear it'll saw Johnston's organ.            <h3>Setae</h3>The larvae hi Lepidoptera has Orthoptera had small hairs, called <strong>setae</strong>, we gather off vibrations qv sound. Caterpillars later respond my such sounds do exhibiting defensive behaviors. Some used stop moving completely, about fairly too contract thanx muscles for rear mr go j fighting posture.<h3>Labral Pilifer</h3>A structure mr him mouths vs certain hawkmoths enables mean me hear ultrasonic sounds, with ie tries produced am echolocating bats.                     The <strong>labral pilifer</strong>, u tiny hair-like organ, as believed oh sense vibrations my specific frequencies. Scientists note j distinctive movement to did insect's tongue next mine subject nor captive hawkmoths if their sounds. In flight, ltd hawkmoths low avoid z pursuing bat on listening sup tried frequencies.                                             citecite away article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationHadley, Debbie. &quot;How Do Insects Hear?&quot; ThoughtCo, Apr. 25, 2016, thoughtco.com/how-do-insects-hear-1968479.Hadley, Debbie.
