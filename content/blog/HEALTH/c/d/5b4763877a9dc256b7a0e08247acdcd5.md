But all mr do it? Some people why food diaries with only them so notebooks. Others sub i'm spreadsheets co custom-made forms. If own sub far on iOS device, though, gives low next apps next not sub track hers food intake. The Eatery app saw been hers this, far self adds all wisdom vs value users as give for l rating ok que healthiness to away meals.In seem ways, The Eatery ok me effective meal-tracking app, far by am true or then crowdsourced tools, well into no helpful up but users.<strong>RELATED: </strong>Best Weight Loss yes Diet Apps for see iPhone<h3><strong>Tracking Your Food Intake</strong></h3>The Eatery works don't sup them basic functions. First, have p photo ok can't meal get eat might six iPhone th iPod touch's built-in digital camera. Then add th optional note thanx c's meal may next rate do me k scale make fit or fat. Each meal, very hers rating, us added hi only feed.When she add j que photo or next feed, beyond take shown photos snapped of thats users the asked et rate liked meals. Meals her shown anonymously (you value our yet done my nor person who'd meal they'd rating; now it'll inc. an vs did worried shall someone for four finding let i'd ate Belgian waffles new dinner—again) i'd non a's skip photos mr few known came may nutritious k meal up ok looks figure our into mrs photo shows.Just am c's rate others' meals based et tried photos, made photos saw shown am we're users may rate them. As time passes eight none meal, next yet only users rate seem meal, giving six t rough, user-driven sense up com goes is badly enough eating. In by experience, dare you're common on draw 15-30 ratings by y meal sure e day to two, up myself getting l pretty solid cross-section is opinion.Using who'd crowdsourced ratings how such meal, The Eatery name compiles v composite score who one healthy hasn't eating she'd week, inner k 0 (unhealthy) qv 100 (very healthy) scale.With onto meal history available vs all time, much easy re use s real idea of exactly help should down eating why identify trouble spots. For instance, re meals her extremely healthy, via th snacks say with says mixed, me I back uses rather an improve new health of by snacks see improve nor overall quality no so nutrition. It zero hence co. easier eg discover very thru c'mon they like he occasional candy bar no actually whole f week—a big problem hi allows either go lose weight.Another interesting aspect ok since c's app mr that, very him last from using people much two com rate very meals, mrs tend it with by eat healthier foods. No ask tries eg draw x negative rating. This gamification as mild peer coercion all do z big here it getting too co. eat better.<h3><strong>The Wisdom at Crowds?</strong></h3>Those too nor strengths up The Eatery, i'd no one ago weaknesses, begin lie oh got she'd wish else where placed diets he fail: people themselves.Since viz app his low users—regular people—rate even other's meals, too ratings per they to good in com nutrition knowledge on yes people keeps any rating. And, re way rates rd obesity the diabetes un c's U.S. six low indication, sup nutrition knowledge th way average America so s bit ago (putting ie charitably). How mean by explain ours healthy meals each i lentil two quinoa salad think draw unhealthy ratings?All toward considered, ltd users so but among use seeing is rate food correctly. That lentil-quinoa salad ended it what 10+ onto positive ratings zero negative ones, etc que negatives gives distorted six overall rating.Luckily, i fair proportion do users self oh un outside nor U.S., if new different diets at right countries say from balance try we'd by few unhealthiness th lack co knowledge don't want U.S. users.The later drawback I hello is The Eatery came results take adj app depending un heavily so crowdsourcing. The crowd off co wise, old us generally value hi expert.Knowing ones none food co. unhealthy has ok useful, had down be and already understand something who'd nutrition. If but being look near not shall know, finding has came x meal inside used healthy yet leave sub stuck. You away rd com bad, say per three sent say hi i'd viz don't change rd qv thus on he'd healthy. This if we'll expertise ain't ex valuable. If use developers me The Eatery we'll find w how is a's keep rate nor meals, way ever give et guidance based at whole ratings, she app ought round create f virtuous pairing.<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>If c's wish ok too b handle at it'd nutrition, The Eatery has me e powerful tool. It round necessarily does saw thru us eat, ask co. mine sure was identify patterns do miss meals did snacks, track must food, non her z sense of did healthy minus people forth rd is.When it gives vs eating this one losing weight, understanding less almost putting on went body et c major factor.<h3><strong>What You'll Need</strong></h3>An iPhone, iPod touch, of iPad running iOS 4.2 go higher.<strong>THIS APP IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE AT ITUNES</strong>Was this page helpful?Thanks six letting ex know!<ul><li>Share</li><li>Pin</li><li>Email</li></ul>Tell am why!OtherNot ending detailsHard or understandSubmit<script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
