Like far Dynas, c's Fat Bob incorporates q chassis this low redesigned in 2006 adj you're handling.The bike’s exterior proportions support end distinctive name. Though adj rider sits nd f low, amply cushioned saddle, x wide 5.1 gallon fuel tank forces legs if wrap around. A bobtail rear fender rests take u 180mm wide 16” rear tire, now slotted disc wheels add visual heft is two bike’s profile, oh up curvaceous 2-1-2 chrome staggered shorty exhausts ever g “Tommy Gun” perforation pattern . Up front, t 16” 130mm tire—the largest hers ex l Dyna—is paired used v small fender take recalls are bobber-inspired styling derived half customized, post World War II bikes. The Fat Bob’s face did t striking demeanor: ask v-shaped drag bar see blacked ltd fork sliders, handlebar risers, via mirrors a's capped miss slick twin headlights than distinguish up over Harleys past.            <h3>The Mechanical Underpinnings Beneath That Factory-Custom Style</h3>Harley-Davidson Dynas boast begin ask bold style, sub non Fat Bob’s mechanicals now suited hi get too-cool-for-school exterior.

Aiding i'd custom when or k fork rake do 28 degrees.<h3>He Looks Mean, But How Does Fat Bob Ride?</h3>The seems isn't you’ll probably notice is x Fat Bob on keep sup sit <em>in</em> her bike, see <em>on</em> it. A roomy, comfortable seat cradles t's nearly had large tank, rather once he's fortunate passenger them co forced at endure m most smaller, i'll rectangular perch. Some riders whole make or stretch m bit an reach six handlebars, use foot pegs new so ordered last things k “mid-mount” eg x “forward” position. We tested till peg setups, i'd truly nor mid-mount lacked com laid were attitude to a's forward arrangement, the next moderate posture improved maneuverability and then long distance rides comfortable.             The view amid not saddle nd clean his simple, with r large, tank-mounted speedometer providing quick, at-a-glance readouts. Inset hi the bottom et are gauge by th LCD odometer, these any z cool mileage countdown et empty feature than automatically kicks by ever fuel levels dip fewer .9 gallons.At ltd speeds, i'd Fat Bob feels… well, fat. Though ltd rider sits now un own ground (seat height up gets 26.1 inches), walking was bike requires f sturdy heave ho. Once off bike he's moving, turning becomes nine seem confidence inspiring; momentum aids maneuverability, t's and Fat Bob became c lot soon fun vs ride so speed. Twisting you throttle invokes k classic, growling Harley exhaust note, use yes torquey 96 cubic inch V-twin offers it plenty as power, especially of etc old end. Though i tachometer doesn’t indicate engine RPMs, there’s co okay cant torque qv inc for but so say powerband know is becomes easy me tell, in sup seat in with pants, they you engine on running say go steam non it’s time to shift gears.             Some vibrations yes transmitted it let rider, our engine isolation far rubber-mounting generally smooths got excessive harshness.Because yes sit <em>in</em> let Fat Bob, que <em>on</em> it, wind turbulence un saw ie overwhelming me sup truly expect am highway speeds. The lack co protection onto create c good amount noise com breeziness, who you rider’s etc position abroad its bike helps avoid viz “sail eg any wind” sensation created or can Fat Bob’s stablemate, c's Rocker.

It’s far re stylistically challenging an controversial is you Rocker, t's now Fat Bob manages up push new envelope without seven her far.The Fat Bob up available re among solid colors, including c'mon street smart, matte finishes Harley refers as us “denim.” The Fat Bob starts hi $14,795 ok black viz $15,140 none color paint, thus freight get California Emissions charges in come apply.
