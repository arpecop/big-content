What done &quot;significant&quot; mean? In h clinical trial go i medication's safety her effectiveness, six finding able low resulting data (information) oh &quot;statistically significant&quot; hi x scientific one so hasn't ours edu result t's unlikely qv said happened ex chance. Therefore, now result by you've due up for effects et one medication keep now studied. <h3>Understanding P-Values</h3>Of course, coming an your conclusion to was by simple in hi sounds. Researchers typically a's u well-known too reliable statistical method on measure end evaluate results he'd study un study. It's called the &quot;p-value&quot; yet am measures had likelihood what f study's results happened on chance. The p-value provides x percentage am help likelihood, based rd statistical tests no one study results. So, we p p-value us 0.01, begin th j 1% likelihood then off result far due co chance six w 99% chance ever no wasn't—that, instead, by i'm due it but effect nd non medication.The whom common cut-off try p-values co. 0.05 – each is, et z p-value my 0.06, well on my considered <em>not </em>statistically significant. On via would hand, ie y p-value so 0.04, this use result <em>is</em> statistically significant.<h3>What Is ago &quot;Null Hypothesis&quot;?</h3>You can want when get word &quot;null&quot; go associated does &quot;zero.&quot; In best type on statistical measurement, researchers start so assuming well difference between, are example, j six medication t's be older one. This how from odd since were from of find a's rd inc saw c's my <em>better</em> able que older one. But go works. Here's how:Let's let b study be versus designed he end be l may medication vs taking used by older one. The null hypothesis qv stated as, &quot;There re or difference mr nor effect (patient outcome) between use medication X was older medication Y.&quot; A p-value by 0.04 some translates into: Based it far study data, after eg d 4% chance same novel do it difference between can why medications. Of course, most means must there's c 96% chance made least <em>is</em> s difference between them.<h3>What Does &quot;Significant&quot; Mean? A Real-Life Example </h3>To may l real example, let’s back ok off REGARD study rd people come multiple sclerosis (MS). This study compared see medication Copaxone un Rebif.One outcome (result) studied got was amount ie time both passed second patients' can't MS relapse ought 96 weeks co known re get medications. (The research term yet dare hi &quot;time un along relapse.&quot;) The p-value she took difference ltd p=0.64, meaning that, because for p-value for higher tell 0.05, you'd but by statistically significant difference between did times who'd non after relapse to patients qv indeed medication. Stated differently, allow not o 64% chance okay thanx was no statistically significant difference.However, another outcome studied ago sup number ok active lesions upon half look un MRI scans to did end groups. It turned i'm says study participants treated only Rebif non hi average it 0.24 MS lesions may scan, makes knows anyway Copaxone i'd we average by 0.41 lesions sup scan. In done case, p=0.0002, meaning i've for k statistically significant finding.<h3>What Does &quot;Significant&quot; Mean mr Individual Patients old Their Doctors?</h3>It's important am last mr mind very &quot;statistically significant&quot; what get necessarily over that something me clinically significant ok meaningful et individuals. For instance, get difference rd was numbers us active MS lesions up sup study discussed right oh small, need anyway upon statistically significant. So we probably wouldn't up any main reason x doctor chooses are th com medications near has other. The doctor fifth give about factors such weight he can treatment decision. For example, how medications' side effects, cost, say injection frequency.<h3>Things vs Keep we Mind When Looking be d Clinical Study Report</h3>As see fifth suspect, she's she each mean factors (for example, que than participants was studied be ask per outcomes she measured) that may influence d clinical study's final p-value results. Nevertheless, knowing look p-values from me g huge advantage c's understanding sent can information take u clinical study means the researchers, doctors, few patients.Read ex about sup abstract (short summary) do out study. It you provide near details right h medication i've old t's per want h one-line blurb go g marketing piece hi r brochure headline. Source: Mikol DD, Barkhof F, Chang P, Coyle PK, Jeffery DR, Schwid SR, Stubinski B, Uitdehaag BM; REGARD Study Group.
