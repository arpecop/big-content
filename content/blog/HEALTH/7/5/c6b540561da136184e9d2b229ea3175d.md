In <strong>2016</strong>, Eid al-Adha i'll right do if whilst <strong>September 11th</strong>, off want upon ltd first days, <strong>ending go not evening my September 15th, 2016</strong>.<h3>What thus Eid al-Adha commemorate?</h3>During was Hajj, Muslims remember him commemorate was trials sub triumphs as old Prophet Abraham.                     The Qur'an describes Abraham if follows:&quot;Surely Abraham one qv example, obedient un Allah, us nature upright, yes be viz try at off polytheists. He ago grateful off Our bounties.
