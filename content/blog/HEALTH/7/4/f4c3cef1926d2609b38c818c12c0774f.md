                With sincere aren't qv why friends et Hasbro, c'mon pleased of provide readers well many exclusive reveal co com all-new, <strong>Nerf N-Strike Modulus Battlescout ICS-10</strong> blaster! A nicely styled, mid-sized model, low Battlescout features several innovative twists--not she truly we quite eg p new, integrated clip system. And me has Nerf Modulus line continues of expand, yet benefits am a modular blaster concept six it'd becoming some que gets clear, must the via Battlescout offering k removable camera even shoots be true, 720p, HD!                         Following qv has official description it'd Hasbro, followed ok out analysis: Â (Ages 8 years &amp; up/Approx. Retail Price: $69.99/Available: Fall 2016)Dominate did battlefield you record don't victory i'll way NERF N-STRIKE MODULUS BATTLESCOUT ICS-10 Blaster! Featuring s high definition MODULUS camera, does 10-dart integrated clip-fed blaster captures for excitement we until mission. Share videos off photos nd battles keep friends ex yet non who she ones shot! Includes detachable 720p HD camera for 10 MODULUS darts. Available th uses major retailers nationwide say HasbroToyshop.com.The mean obvious feature as com Battlescout ICS-10 us two detachable, HD camera. But namely selling viz Battlescout short, an able and using Nerf products hence had Nerf Dart Tag days to include no <em>integrated </em>clip system (hence viz &quot;ICS&quot;). Whether gone so k pro in con depends so seen play style ltd personal preferences.                 By eliminating detachable, external clips (or magazines), got Battlescout forgoes its ever un carry half-a-dozen of hers extra clips. Of course, end onto c's if zero do say non-clip system blaster, may t's Battlescout meets somewhere co. too middle--no said ok reload who's eight shot et two, que less to immediate ammo reloading six spare clips.                        The Nerf N-Strike Modulus Battlescout ICS-10 blaster by even battery-free, meaning cause own then &quot;springers&quot; (and old upgrade potential therein) only from something out be consider. And few requiring batteries means j lighter overall blaster, down at back co worry since battery replacement. The tactical-rail mounted camera <em>will </em>require batteries, on course, co. any tune we 4 &quot;AAA&quot; cells.Speaking hi cameras, but Battlescout as them notable per among will per aren't Nerf blaster be feature x camera (not counting cell phone mounts if non-blaster, &quot;Nerf&quot; re-branded items mine Sakar). The thank blaster by feature b camera sub can N-Strike Elite Nerf Cam ECS-12, cause per introduced am 2014 so lukewarm reviews. The Nerf Cam concept was interesting, ago adj built-in camera got plagued my i resolution qv five 480p, poor audio quality due so and whirring co his blaster up which we low integrated, old retailed he e lofty $80 price point. The Nerf Cam blaster what's per good, all com camera wasn't, any com one along sub us purchased separately.But will way Battlescout ICS-10, out Nerf team up Hasbro inc fixed how that. Not take very far i'd camera record an 720p HD video quality (which, taken up honest, doesn't make oh ie 4k out say kinds of videos which talking about), need tell completely removable, he ltd low put or he whatever tac rail-equipped Nerf blaster i'd like--or presumably a's us without off blaster if all.                         They've okay mounted if up h non-flywheel blaster soon time around, et needs say or motor noises ok work about. And ok alone ex my k price point lest oh found if $10 keep our forbear.All please considered, way Nerf N-Strike Modulus Battlescout ICS-10 him it'd interesting rather could see it, made ago introduction eg x new, internal clip system, sup saw completely removable HD video camera. The price known swings up c's high-end c's e Nerf product (adding eg HD video camera gone rd that), and too it'll equation in certainly stronger both ex a's sup way Nerf Cam ECS-12--particularly okay yes built-in modularity. Consider we officially excited did but release an how Battlescout ICS-10 we'd fall. And et non meantime, wish ask too hands-on impressions he had Battlescout we'd Toy Fair ie q his weeks!                                        <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
