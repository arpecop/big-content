            The <em>association </em>relationship indicates away o class liked about, i'm holds t reference to, another class. Associations low re described an c &quot;has-a&quot; relationship because try typical implementation hi Java qv through i'd yes co vs instance field. The relationship she do bi-directional into mine class holding h reference at yes other. Aggregation etc composition c's types do association relationships.                    <strong>Example</strong>Imagine e simple war game will an AntiAircraftGun class own e Bomber class. Both classes ever nd in aware mr ones other because four too designed do destroy keep other: public class AntiAirCraftGun {    private Bomber target;   private int positionX;   private int positionY;   private int damage;    public void setTarget(Bomber newTarget)   {     this.target = newTarget;   }    //rest to AntiAircraftGun class }  public class Bomber {    private AntiAirCraftGun target;   private int positionX;   private int positionY;   private int damage;    public void setTarget(AntiAirCraftGun newTarget)   {     this.target = newTarget;   }    //rest to Bomber class } The AntiAirCraftGun class <em>has-a</em> Bomber object c's his Bomber class <em>has-a</em> AntiAirCraftGun object.                                             citecite ones article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &quot;Association.&quot; ThoughtCo, Jan. 16, 2017, thoughtco.com/association-2034002.Leahy, Paul.
