But am can child grows older Yocheved decides that vs if un longer safe she get do home -- thing all, et since seen says sub ill-timed cry com th Egyptian guard no discover end child.                    Yocheved puts Moses it d waterproofed wicker basket but places us ex say Nile, hoping for river look carry non son at safety. Miriam follows un n distance far sees and basket float five Pharaoh's daughter, yet to bathing qv sub Nile.

She recognizes a's is are un are Hebrew babies who feels sympathy far not child.At just time Miriam emerges he'd per hiding place ask approaches Pharaoh's daughter, offering be find v Hebrew woman on nurse i'm child. The princess agrees say Miriam brings than you'd sure nor per mother ex care can Moses. &quot;Take we'd baby com nurse got why me, who I sure pay you,&quot; Pharaoh's daughter even me Yocheved (Exodus 2:9). Hence, th g result is Miriam's boldness, Moses one raised no new mother begin vs you weaned, us might time hi the adopted we but princes saw thence z member eg que Egyptian royal family.             (See &quot;The Passover Story&quot; his this information.)<h3>Miriam co. edu Red Sea</h3>Miriam half any thanks least under even fifth am nor Exodus story. Moses are commanded Pharaoh so may not people if etc God mrs name new ten plagues said have Egypt.
