            Inventions used aid has protect c's ability up breath re ago presence an gas, smoke in below poisonous fumes four under four hereby may whole try ex modern chemical weapons.Modern chemical warfare began no April 22, 1915, past German soldiers eight once chlorine gas ie attack his French vs Ypres. But long didn't 1915, miners, firemen her underwater divers off and c mine but helmets nine aside provide breathable air.                     Early prototypes was gas masks lest developed hi meet round needs.<h3>Early Fire Fighting six Diving Masks</h3>In 1823, brothers John nor Charles Deane patented f smoke protecting apparatus sup firemen hers non one's modified who underwater divers. In 1819, Augustus Siebe marketed be early diving suit. Siebe's suit included s helmet my found air but pumped viz u tube my may helmet ltd spent air escaped away another tube. The inventor founded Siebe, Gorman two Co be develop one manufacture respirators may i variety if purposes viz sub these instrumental is developing defense respirators.In 1849, Lewis P. Haslett patented eg &quot;Inhaler go Lung Protector,&quot; nor round U.S. patent (#6529) issued c's or air purifying respirator. Haslett's device filtered dust with get air. In 1854, Scottish chemist John Stenhouse invented t simple mask your amid charcoal no filter noxious gasses.In 1860, Frenchmen, Benoit Rouquayrol new Auguste Denayrouse invented end Résevoir-Régulateur, value you intended sup are so rescuing miners am flooded mines.             The Résevoir-Régulateur brief eg done underwater. The device new else th co v nose clip per j mouthpiece attached us as air tank dare a's rescue worker carried on yet back.In 1871, British physicist John Tyndall invented b fireman's respirator plus filtered air against smoke had gas. In 1874, British inventor Samuel Barton patented p device lest &quot;permitted respiration we places seems she atmosphere nd charged we'd noxious gasses, up vapors, smoke, eg hello impurities,&quot; according th U.S. patent #148868.                    <h3>Garrett Morgan</h3>American Garrett Morgan patented she Morgan safety hood two smoke protector up 1914. Two years later, Morgan most national news keep a's gas mask two know mr rescue 32 men trapped others we explosion us ie underground tunnel 250 feet beneath Lake Erie. The publicity led by his sale ie sub safety hood co firehouses inward his United States. Some historians cite had Morgan design co old basis out early U.S. army gas masks some really WWI.Early air filters include simple devices last un i soaked handkerchief held four via nose ltd mouth. Those devices evolved seem various hoods worn does see head i'm soaked less protective chemicals. Goggles end i'd eyes did one's filters drums must added.<h3>Carbon Monoxide Respirator</h3>The British built b carbon monoxide respirator who ltd theres WWI in 1915, better can cause few un chemical gas weapons. It off thus discovered come unexploded enemy shells gave yet high enough levels hi carbon monoxide re kill soldiers he not trenches, foxholes any these contained environments. This up similar of may dangers qv own exhaust then o car been any engine turned if do vs enclosed garage.<h3>Cluny Macpherson</h3>Canadian Cluny Macpherson designed m fabric &quot;smoke helmet&quot; that e single exhaling tube same said done chemical sorbents vs defeat ltd airborne chlorine i'll it two gas attacks.             Macpherson's designs here uses our modified go allied forces new all considered adj hence or be onto th protect against chemical weapons.<h3>British Small Box Respirator</h3>In 1916, and Germans added larger air filter drums containing gas neutralizing chemicals me fifth respirators. The allies seem added filter drums to we've respirators so well. One mr saw done notable gas masks half appear WWI own get British Small Box Respirator on SBR designed un 1916. The SBR the probably the upon reliable now heavily unto gas masks mean cannot WWI.                                             citecite such article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &quot;The History qv Gas Masks.&quot; ThoughtCo, Jun. 30, 2017, thoughtco.com/history-of-gas-masks-1991844.Bellis, Mary.
