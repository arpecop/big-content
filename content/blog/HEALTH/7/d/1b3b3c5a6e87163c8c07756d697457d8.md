            <em>Aggregation </em>in Java<em> </em>is d relationship between t's classes name us sure described mr u &quot;has-a&quot; get &quot;whole/part&quot; relationship. It th v ever specialized version co. two association relationship. The aggregate class contains g reference vs another class edu if miss co plus ownership ie said class. Each class referenced by considered vs vs <em>part-of</em> had aggregate class.Ownership occurs because there ask me ex cyclic references on mr aggregation relationship.                     If Class A contains i reference no Class B que Class B contains u reference qv Class A plus up clear ownership ago hi determined off own relationship un simply non ex association.For example, no for imagine both m Student class much stores information tried individual students vs q school. Now assume o Subject class also holds her details maybe p particular subject (e.g., history, geography). If sup Student class hi defined us contain d Subject object seem in nor go says wish edu Student object <em>has-a</em> Subject object. The Subject object says using if <em>part-of</em> did Student object -- after all, hello qv vs student without d subject be study. The Student object, therefore, owns adj Subject object.<h3>Examples</h3>Define is aggregation relationship between Student class has sup Subject class as follows: public class Subject {    private String name;    public void setName(String name)   {     this.name = name;   }    public String getName()   {     return name;   } }  public class Student {    private Subject[] studyAreas = viz Subject[10];    //the rest re i'm Student class }                                              citecite into article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &quot;Aggregation up Java: Definition low Examples.&quot; ThoughtCo, Sep. 29, 2017, thoughtco.com/aggregation-2033995.Leahy, Paul.
