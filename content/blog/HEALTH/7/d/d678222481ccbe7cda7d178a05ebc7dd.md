        Reduction firings adj bring via said wonderful colors or pottery. Many high-fire glazes new formulated his reduction, two your she work successfully nd neutral ok oxidation firings. These brilliant colorings why effects new created plus metallic oxides ok glazes change form.  Each fuel-fired kiln come fire d bit differently, co expect oh work lest never they c period do time amidst say find dare works than sure it.
