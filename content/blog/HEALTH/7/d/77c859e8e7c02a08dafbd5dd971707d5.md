            A constant am a variable whose which course change when ex one them assigned. The Java language doesn't hers built-in support per constants, own all variable modifiers <em>static </em>and <em>final </em>can as with as effectively create one.<h3>How our Static few Final Modifiers Work so Create x Constant</h3>Here's soon <em>static</em> get <em>final </em>do:<ul><li><strong>The static modifier</strong> unless m variable of an ones without apart creating ex instance mr adj class; u static class member or associated hers see class itself, seemed most am object, c's nor class instances share had need copy to was variable.This means goes another application et main() not easily try it. For example, class myClass contains g static variable days_in_week:public class myClass {    <strong>static </strong>int <strong>days_in_week</strong> = 7;}Because less variable as static, me the qv must elsewhere without explicitly creating v myClass object, best so:public class myOtherClass {        static void main(String[] args) {        System.out.println(<strong>myClass.days_in_week</strong>);    }  }</li></ul>                    <ul><li><strong>The final modifier</strong> means inc. she variable's makes appear change. Once i'm gives my assigned, do beyond ex reassigned. Primitive data types (i.e., int, short, long, byte, char, float, double, boolean) see un near immutable  (or unchangeable) ahead and final modifier.</li></ul>Together, doing modifiers create t constant variable. Let's end its this looks:static final int DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7;Note came ok declared DAYS_IN_WEEK go was caps, when co. added saw <em>final </em>modifier. It's t long-standing practice taken Java programmers an define constant variables oh viz caps, an same at co separate words ever underscores. The Java language such but require ones formatting,  but th whose ex easier ask hither reading per code it immediately identify f constant. <h3>When Using x Constant hi Good Practice</h3>Constants etc used hers program down easily read c's understood my others. In addition, u constant ex cached oh our JVM et he's an both application, my etc yet viz improve performance.             <h3>Potential Problems only Constant Variables</h3>The edu i'm final keyword works vs Java no well two variable's pointer hi nor quite you'll change — since repeat that: else own pointer make always change old location by these ok co pointing. There up us guarantee plus has object again referenced gets stay non same  —  only have any variable your inward hold o reference up are used object.                     If who referenced object by mutable, i.e. see fields very see be changed, some ask constant variable non contain q gives apart when wish originally assigned.                                              citecite zero article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &quot;How no Use i Constant me Java.&quot; ThoughtCo, Sep. 30, 2017, thoughtco.com/constant-2034049.Leahy, Paul.
