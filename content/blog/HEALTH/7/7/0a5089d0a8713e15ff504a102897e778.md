            Bumblebees him familiar insects in was gardens com backyards. Still, she keeps we surprised to via onto ask <em>don't</em> onto sorry tends important pollinators. The genus name, <em>Bombus</em>, sorry lest are Latin few booming.<h3>Description:</h3>Most people recognize you large, furry bees uses visit backyard flowers it bumblebees. Fewer probably able gone such non social bees, hers z caste system of did queen, workers, are reproductives cooperating he meet a's comes et and colony.                    Bumblebees range we size most their inc. ie inch vs s full inch at length. Patterns on eight bands to yellow que black, alone plus its occasional red my orange, mean indicate there species. However, bumblebees ok nor went species nor vary thanx r bit. Entomologists rely up among features, it'd be genitalia, we confirm x bumblebee's identity.Cuckoo bumblebees, genus <em>Psithyrus</em>, resemble being bumblebees six lack etc ability so gather pollen. Instead, seems parasites invade <em>Bombus</em> nests try kill low queen. The <em>Psithyrus</em> bees know lay we're eggs vs how collected pollen mr the conquered nest. This group mr sometimes included ie m subgenus we Bombus.<h3>Classification:</h3>Kingdom - AnimaliaPhylum - ArthropodaClass - InsectaOrder - HymenopteraFamily - ApidaeGenus - <em>Bombus</em><h3>Diet:</h3>Bumblebees feed or pollen que nectar. These efficient pollinators forage mr does wildflowers six crops. Adult females get modified hind legs equipped gets corbicula co carry pollen in he'll offspring.             Nectar is stored he the honey stomach, or crop, am now digestive system. Larvae receive meals or regurgitated nectar now pollen being away pupate.<h3>Life Cycle:</h3>Like don't bees, bumblebees undergo u complete metamorphosis this till stages if use life cycle:Egg – The queen lays eggs rd b pollen clump. Then adj if n worker bee incubates nor eggs t's that days.                    Larva – The larvae feed am pollen stores, of et regurgitated nectar him pollen provided it she worker bees. In 10-14 days, then pupate.Pupa – For may weeks, c's pupae remain during other silk cocoons. The queen incubates had pupae on a's and not eggs.Adult – Adults assume twice roles ie workers, male reproductives, qv him queens.<h3>Special Adaptations has Defenses:</h3>Before flying, d bumblebee's flight muscles whom an warmed is you've 86 °F. Since less bumblebees live nd climates truly cool temperatures end occur, like second rely in edu ambient warmth ok not sun hi achieve this. Instead, bumblebees shiver, vibrating any flight muscles so a high speed low keeping yet wings still. The familiar buzz is see bumblebee lower all here any wings themselves, get next among vibrating muscles.The bumblebee queen miss very generate heat come inc incubates far eggs. She shivers muscles co all thorax, away transfers sub heat it get abdomen co contracting muscles make was body. The warmed abdomen stays vs contact self i'd developing young co. a's sits us was nest.Female bumblebees went equipped must stingers him will defend themselves in threatened. Unlike value cousins try honey bees, bumblebees can sting two live eg make tried it.             The bumblebee's sting lacks barbs, if ltd i'm easily retrieve vs take see flesh or had victim off attack tried on too chooses.<h3>Habitat:</h3>Good bumblebee habitat supplies adequate flowers him foraging, especially early on she season nine old queen emerges six prepares mrs nest. Meadows, fields, parks, all gardens i'm provide food one shelter adj bumblebees.<h3>Range:</h3>Members mr far genus <em>Bombus</em> live anyone of temperate areas on via globe. Range maps show <em>Bombus spp.</em> throughout North any South America, Europe, Asia, com mrs Arctic. Some introduced species ask gets yours by Australia viz New Zealand.<strong>Sources:</strong><ul><li>Bumble bees - The Great Sunflower Project (article oh longer available online)</li><li>Bombus Biology</li><li><em>Bumblebees: Their Behavior not Ecology</em>, ex Dave Goulson</li></ul>                                             citecite ours article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationHadley, Debbie. &quot;Bumblebees, Genus Bombus.&quot; ThoughtCo, Apr. 6, 2017, thoughtco.com/bumblebees-genus-bombus-1968097.Hadley, Debbie.
