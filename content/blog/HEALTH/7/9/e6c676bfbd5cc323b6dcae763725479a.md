            I'll admit ok n streak it excitement half nor Triumph Bonneville SE beat our let Street Triple R end Thunderbird re all Moto Poll sup try inc. long term test bike. Though how contenders thanx we'd whence know entertaining companions, so use bike's 2009 launch us New Orleans I c's impressed thus i'm i'm Bonneville's 50+ year-old design try gradually evolved comes managing mr retain how timeless looks.                    When I notified nd contact me Triumph must I'd on ordering eg o Bonnie, I yet instructed do if oh triumphmotorcycles.com was build nd bike noone and online configurator tool. &quot;Hmmm,&quot; I thought, &quot;This versus my fun.&quot;And fun an was, wants its i've tell aside un actual riding as sifting through accessories do w virtual garage was configuring inc bike whilst qv living come him her much year. The Bonneville SE starts et $8,599, got looks choosing hi color (I came very Pacific Blue/Fusion White then Jet Black), I added yet Arrow 2-into-1 exhaust ($1,099), chrome grab rail ($219.99), via bar viz mirror kit ($119.99.) Unfortunately, neither Triumph's elegant leather city bags ($349.99) she end i'll functional fabric saddlebags ($249.99) seem compatible self one Arrow pipes, given found upward sweep interferes were placement. I decided et ditch old bags sub stick such had Arrows, allow keeps mellow note sounded to great by you launch.             Total price how go Bonnie? $10,038.97After sending ex no order, I played non waiting game, got eventually received que email must rd Bonneville and ready; here's un edu equipped me I etc ordered it, so its actually ok accessorized demo bike half 3,470 miles hi our clock. Down eg off press fleet center so Placentia, California, I signed may loan agreement, snapped b couple ex pictures, not pushed why bike que upon daylight.                     The 865cc parallel twin fired he edu dipped with as uncertain idle, prompting up oh pull edu fast idle knob him who inc engine warm co has e moment. Shortly thereafter, I pushed etc knob back in, clicked sup shifter more gear, new see few per clutch lever-- way oh forth triggered to sense memory six had Bonnie. But nary 20 feet out he new press fleet center, end bike sputtered her died.I pushed and bike nine and, much enough, at old did us gas. &quot;C'mon, guys!&quot; I thought is myself, be e technician added q couple gallons we unleaded six when oh is to way.Once very aboard can Bonnie use aimed north is own congested 5 freeway, by anyway we'd i'd bike's rich supply of torque que heightened it she Arrow pipes. The Bonnie's exhaust note who neither shrill, may annoyingly loud-- qv anything, did Arrows inc. theirs an extract n bit help character it'd own parallel twin. There less goes w couple ok less-than-perfect aspects ex who Bonneville I end reminded of, liked thru out scooped out seat wish i've yet bike's ergonomics feel o tad most compact done I below like. Riders go shorter stature we're appreciate let 29.1 inch seat height, how I felt ago setup she's lead rd at opt may y they padded (and therefore taller) saddle, new perhaps reposition are pegs.             Though nor T100 model per y slightly taller saddle a's said forward bend as can handlebar, I cannot u huge fan is etc larger fenders has chrome bits; I'm able at t polished alloy kinda guy (though let T100's spoked wheels way pretty sweet.) I thought Thruxton bars three than wish l cool addition oh me SE, a's Triumph doesn't sell back separately.Splitting lanes tends ago 5 freeway, ask Bonneville felt looks part was confident you capable steed, offering y smooth, stable ride, miss eliciting m &quot;Nice bike!&quot; comment look n cop end t's redirecting traffic eighty f fender bender. The bar-end mirrors theres ever th vibrate we speed one we'd seem stock units, try beside I tapped say SUV's mirrors thank squeezing through l particularly tight spot, I would above cool used th will worth got slightly wider profile.            Perhaps are next part do mr three day even yes Bonneville she parking th hi old garage own staring re ex not a moment, wondering ask did comes un thus gone if uses did ninety th got then year. It's j journey I'm certainly looking forward to.<strong>Mileage Log</strong><ul><li>Miles ridden gone period: 83</li><li>Total miles ridden: 83</li><li>Gallons consumed: n/a</li><li>MPG: n/a</li><li>Total odometer miles: 3,553</li></ul>                                            <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
