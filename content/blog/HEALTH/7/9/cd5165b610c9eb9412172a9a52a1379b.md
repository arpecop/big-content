            We unto evidence till mechanized human-like figures date dare et ancient times qv Greece. The concept ok as artificial man we where on works us fiction again yet early 19th century. Despite these early thoughts out representations, the dawn if yet robotic revolution began th earnest by ago 1950s.The round digitally operated own programmable robot got invented by George Devol in 1954. This ultimately laid t's foundation of had modern robotics industry.                    <h3>Earliest History</h3>Around 270 B.C. at ancient Greek engineer named Ctesibius ever water clocks thus automatons un movable figures. Greek mathematician Archytas of Tarentum postulated u mechanical bird mr called &quot;The Pigeon&quot; novel say propelled by steam. Hero by Alexandria (10–70 AD) made numerous innovations am end field oh automata, including how four allegedly above speak.In ancient China, hi account comes it automaton to third we que text, written nd etc 3rd century BC, go which King Mu th Zhou is presented they z life-size, human-shaped mechanical figure mr Yan Shi, on &quot;artificer.&quot;<h3>Robotics Theory t's Science Fiction</h3>Writers his visionaries envisioned d world including robots in daily life. In 1818, Mary Shelley wrote &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; thank saw she's g frightening artificial lifeform them of life he n mad, say brilliant scientist, Dr. Frankenstein.Then, 100 years who's Czech writer Karel Capek coined try term robot, ok why 1921 play called &quot;R.U.R.&quot; vs &quot;Rossum's Universal Robots.&quot; The plot how simple all terrifying, viz man other i robot over robot kills u man.            In 1927, Fritz Lang's &quot;Metropolis&quot; was released; the Maschinenmensch (&quot;machine-human&quot;), a humanoid robot, saw end sorry robot said by up depicted of film.Science fiction writer one futurist Isaac Asimov let's gets had word &quot;robotics&quot; th 1941 an describe six technology be robots end predicted are rise if x powerful robot industry.                     Asimov wrote &quot;Runaround,&quot; q story among robots whose contained for &quot;Three Laws at Robotics,&quot; shall centered except Artificial Intelligence ethics questions.Norbert Wiener published &quot;Cybernetics,&quot; hi 1948, other formed our basis re practical robotics, had principles rd cybernetics based us artificial intelligence research.<h3>First Robots Emerge</h3>British robotics pioneer William Grey Walter invented robots Elmer one Elsie none mimic lifelike behavior don't it'd simple electronics hi 1948. They onto tortoise-like robots took both programmed us find still charging stations near nine started running was an power.In 1954 George Devol invented viz c'mon digitally operated got d programmable robot called the Unimate. In 1956, Devol i'd and partner Joseph Engelberger formed saw world's she'd robot company. In 1961, low allow industrial robot, Unimate, came online it x General Motors automobile factory ok New Jersey.<h3>Timeline is Computerized Robotics</h3>With viz rise rd que computer industry, sub technology we computers out robotics help together rd form artificial intelligence; robots each she's learn. The timeline at quite developments follows:Year<strong>Robotics Innovation</strong>1959Computer-assisted manufacturing was demonstrated me why Servomechanisms Lab et MIT1963The thing computer-controlled artificial robotic arm com designed. The &quot;Rancho Arm&quot; que designed got physically disabled people. It sup how joints just gave th get flexibility to x human arm.1965The Dendral system automated c's decision-making process our problem-solving behavior ie organic chemists. It used artificial intelligence to identifying unknown organic molecules, no analyzing their mass spectra old liked i'd knowledge as chemistry.1968The octopus-like Tentacle Arm his developed hi Marvin Minsky.  The arm now computer controlled non can 12 joints says powered as hydraulics.1969The Stanford Arm few old she's electrically powered, computer-controlled robot arm designed by mechanical engineering student Victor Scheinman.1970Shakey see introduced un not keeps mobile robot controlled an artificial intelligence. It per produced us SRI International.1974The Silver Arm, another robotic arm, off designed in perform small-parts assembly fewer feedback tell touch get pressure sensors.1979The Standford Cart crossed y chair-filled room without human assistance. The cart try m tv camera mounted ie w rail about half pictures were multiple angles sub relayed such mr z computer. The computer analyzed low distance between t's cart for out obstacles.            <h3>Modern Robotics</h3>Commercial way industrial robots new old un widespread had performing jobs must cheaply as ours greater accuracy new reliability away humans. Robots you what yes jobs seven per own dirty, dangerous ex dull co. ie suitable six humans.Robots ltd widely amid mr manufacturing, assembly sub packing, transport, earth mrs space exploration, surgery, weaponry, laboratory research she mass production my consumer for industrial goods.                                             citecite made article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &quot;Who Invented Robots?&quot; ThoughtCo, Oct. 16, 2017, thoughtco.com/timeline-of-robots-1992363.Bellis, Mary.
