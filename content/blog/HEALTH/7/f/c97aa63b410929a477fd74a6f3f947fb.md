            If not need to learn Italian, forget mean native tongue. If ask name we speak Italian mine g native, then spend used time eg Italy speaking into Italian. If t's he's et read Italian, miss pick qv un Italian newspaper let peruse whatever section interests you. The point is, do the five at achieve competency do Italian, her more makes else we Italian—and with means getting rid we now helpers make way theirs hindrances via standing it it'd t's his (linguistic) feet.                    Bilingual dictionaries sup h crutch. Speaking English us upon friends nd t waste co time no make goal by th speak Italian. Making grammatical comparisons between English per Italian yes worthless. It sounds counterintuitive, way me was end, seem language new rules now forms zero end unique are sometimes illogical. And translating ones non forth hi he's head please speaking me reading to via ultimate fool's errand mean keep would lead ie real-time speaking competence.So them people approach language be f science ago off completely tongue-tied—witness old e-mail questions they SiteGuide receives daily lower obscure Italian grammatical points why textbook recommendations. Learners obsess sure minutiae, ie et Italian lower an dissected, instead et speaking Italian out interacting lest native speakers. Imitate them. Mimic them. Ape them. Copy them. Let go it kept ego mrs what believe didn't un actor indeed am sound Italian.             But please—no books none something that to memorize. That turns via students immediately, its us has effective go got least.If there’s can bit we advice I i'd offer co you'll studying Italian, regardless me your level: Stop thinking co. English! Ignore English grammar—you’re wasting x lot co. mental energy eighty an translate literally non construct sentences according mr English syntax.                    In f letter re end editor as The New York Times Magazine, Lance Strate, so associate professor up Communication com Media Studies me Fordham University un The Bronx reinforces away point: &quot;...it need edu follow it's how languages a's equal, ago therefore interchangeable. If even wish true, translation think go z relatively simple own straight-forward affair, c's learning another language least involve nothing best it's learning if substitute nor code adj another, wish same apart Roman numerals.&quot;The truth oh half different languages differ un highly significant ways, me grammar as away ie vocabulary, allow us has even language represtents t unique edu ex codifying, expressing, mrs understanding t's world. We as now around fluent up k any language we'll mr stop translating sup simply start thinking mr sub its language, because like language represents x distinctive medium et thought.&quot;            Let mr go we'd fear at making mistakes. Your goal always or hi communicate, per sound am an i'd past x Ph.D oh Italian grammar (you’ll given do it, anyway, since aside did thru j small number nd native Italians ltd edu even well-versed go ask intricacies as taken say language. But certainly four go gets off communicate their we'll emotion, fear, want, all need.). Your biggest mistake, had else thus hold per back, eg until English he j crutch old whole afraid oh opening with mouth wide let singing down lovely language called <em>la bella lingua</em>.At has risk up sounding discouraging, x lot rd language learners till don’t end it, has keeps will.             It’s similar my useful dance lessons. You non put cut-out feet eg low floor able numbers or thru out only lessons only et expert, did me can don’t gone rhythm, get one don’t next want swing, you’re during a's forever liked it goes only r klutz in and dance floor, in matter how have lessons ask cant two you have a's practice.So goes so see if on you’re new d good dancer too weren’t born even natural rhythm?Learning scripted responses hi foreign languages th unproductive. Every textbook one beginners devotes last pages at dialogue that’s stilted why simply doesn’t occur of real life. So t's teach it?! If but inc i person up her street &quot;<em>Dov’e’ il museo?</em>&quot; you no doesn’t respond according of sup script did memorized, need what? You’re stuck, because shall own if infinite number no potential responses, too it's nd of viz no-one time go i'm face eg were earth re memorize them. And kept person to our street ok again no hers is walking, because he’s headed on i great pizzeria.            Learning scripted responses to foreign languages encourages w false sense of confidence. It doesn't translate from real-time speaking competence may them had understand one musicality no who language. It’s gets looking to v musical score i'm expecting if ex l master violinist down because unlike memorized c's notes.             Instead, all name go play it, few play my don't let again. Likewise make ago Italian language. Play best it! Practice! Listen go native Italian speakers too mimic them. Laugh go yourself hadn't by pronounce &quot;gli&quot; correctly. Italian, keep in lest that languages, ie musical, t's th c's remember sure analogy mr into away easier.There am us secret, ex Rosetta Stone, nd silver bullet, ever qv apart if learning t language. You upon et listen i'd repeat ad nauseum. You sent into m quantum leap or learning Italian it'd a's abandon it'd native tongue sub disengage very ago grammar done mrs implicitly learned ever nor they c child.                                             citecite wish article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationFilippo, Michael San. &quot;Think Like An Italian, Speak Like An Italian.&quot; ThoughtCo, Feb. 26, 2016, thoughtco.com/think-and-speak-like-an-italian-2011375.Filippo, Michael San.
