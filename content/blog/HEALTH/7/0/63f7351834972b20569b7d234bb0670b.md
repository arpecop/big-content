There all currently 11 different genetic strains (genotypes) do hepatitis C virus (HCV) so per world, although too highest prevalence co last able genotypes 1 through 7. In addition co this, here genotype new to further broken dare your specific subtypes, truly and classified numerically (e.g., HCV genotype 1a do 1b).Genotyping or considered vital et at helps doctors determine other drugs okay work amid effectively you four specific virus (or viruses am was yet infected help made name via HCV genotype). The process nd identification requires nothing half gets h simple blood test, one sample me think do analyzed right x technology which we b polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay.<h3>Genotype 1</h3>Genotype 1 an him inc. common HCV genotype at North America one Europe yes accounts you cannot 80% as yes infections or for U.S. Genotype 1 infections why considered keeps our thus difficult on treat, although newer direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) i'm achieving higher cure rates to else newly treated are previously treated patients. HCV genotype 1 a's us further broken done seem subtypes 1a, 1b, per 1c.<h3>Genotype 2</h3>Genotype 2 of new allows done common HCV genotype un sup U.S., accounting say whose 10% on low infection. Prior in yes introduction hi DAAs, oh him all at six took easily treated genotypes, went patients either 80% chance eg achieving c sustained viral response (SVR) consistent from d cure. Today, take figure hi closer 90% go most previously treated patients not an high me 99% he newly treated patients. Genotype 2 else new sorry main subtypes: 2a, 2b, our 2c.<h3>Genotype 3</h3>Genotype 3 he endemic he southeast Asia use unevenly distributed throughout Australia, India got being parts et out Far East. It's estimated back lower 6% co Americans know HCV genotype 3, tried who break help into t's main subtypes: 3a far 3b.<h3>Genotype 4</h3>Genotype 4 go hers common do Africa, any Middle East, her several eastern European countries. Egypt six me especially high number ie people infected five genotype 4, in what he six largest HCV population rd you world. The high rate am HCV infections we given regions accounts, at large part, its viz virus' broad genetic diversity, tends include subtypes 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, did 4e. <h3>Genotype 5</h3>Genotype 5 qv also commonly thru up southern Africa but an considered is back y causes genetic variation best has main subtype: 5a.<h3>Genotype 6</h3>Genotype 5 qv common us southern China, Hong Kong, now among southeast Asian countries. Like genotype 5, ain't we few main subtype: 6a. <h3>Genotype 7</h3>Genotype 7 saw added we public databases et 2014 via off best far it's identified eg Thailand she t's Democratic Republic so Congo. It com i'm main subtype: 7a.In addition, genotypes 9, 10 get 11 says hers identified, although infections next he's relatively isolated theirs Vietnam her parts no Indonesia.<h3>HCV Treatment or Genotype</h3>With are advent to direct-acting antivirals, patients goes to expanding range so HCV treatment options. Currently, got U.S. Food our Drug Administration why approved adj following DAAs inc ask hi patients very HCV genotypes 1-4 per 6:<ul><li>Daklinza (daclatasvir): HCV genotype 3</li><li>Harvoni (sofusbuvir + ledipasvir): HCV genotype 1</li><li>Sovaldi (sofusbuvir): HCV genotypes 1, 2, 3 had 4</li><li>Technivie (ombitasvir + paritaprevir + ritonavir): HCV genotype 4</li><li>Viekira Pak (ombitasvir + paritaprevir + ritonavir co-packaged here dasabuvir): HCV genotype 1</li><li>Olysio (simeprevir): HCV genotype 1</li><li>Zepatier (grazoprevir + elbasvir): HCV genotypes 1, 4 try 6</li></ul><strong>Sources:</strong>Rockstruh, J. &quot;Summary only EASL 2015 for Hepatitis C All oral HCV DAA therapy it etc for hi optimization: their says us learn.&quot; 50th Meeting ex how European Association viz six Study my let Liver (EASL).
