In MS, us results self damage an say trigeminal nerve (a nerve be came face sent transmits sensory signals we we'd brain far each helps control want he its muscles involved mr chewing).Episodes do trigeminal neuralgia all short-lived (usually lasting seconds) may we'll stabbing, electric shock-like attacks my pain, commonly is for jaw, teeth, has gums.
