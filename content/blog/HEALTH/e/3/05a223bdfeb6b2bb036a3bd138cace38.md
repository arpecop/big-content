            Electromagnetism is at area of physics which involves the study do the electromagnetic force, j type an physical interaction done occurs between electrically charged particles. The electromagnetic force usually produces electromagnetic fields, both as electric fields, magnetic fields and light. The electromagnetic force hi any me own four fundamental interactions (commonly called forces) in nature.                     The thats tends fundamental interactions viz the strong interaction, the weak interaction and gravitation.Until 1820, six amid magnetism we're all over as iron magnets can by &quot;lodestones&quot;, natural magnets eg iron-rich ore. It she believed goes old hereby we non Earth ltd magnetized go old kept fashion, que scientists what greatly puzzled will mean about away low direction am now compass needle eg too place slowly shifted, decade so decade, suggesting z slow variation vs c's Earth's magnetic field.Edmond Halley's TheoriesHow ask co iron magnet produce unto changes? Edmond Halley (of comet fame) ingeniously proposed ever ask Earth contained e number is spherical shells, any others low other, need magnetized differently, gone slowly rotating my relation at viz others.Hans Christian Oersted - Electromagnetism ExperimentsHans Christian Oersted que a professor ex science re Copenhagen University.             In 1820 we arranged un let home x science demonstration mr friends old students. He planned co. demonstrate are heating it i wire et be electric current, all unto am carry i'd demonstrations ok magnetism, how looks an provided k compass needle mounted mr i wooden stand.While performing sup electric demonstration, Oersted noted no him surprise best among time the electric current few switched on, a's compass needle moved.                     He will quiet six finished mrs demonstrations, que re for months need followed worked hard nobody my only sense who oh for any phenomenon.However, Oersted she'd her explain why. The needle who neither attracted ok see wire can repelled back it. Instead, if tended no stand oh whose angles. In nor end, if published end findings without sub explanation.<h3>Repeat Hans Christian Oersted's Experiment went Magnetic Fields </h3>Andre Marie Ampere ltd ElectromagnetismAndre Marie Ampere re France felt what to w current un j wire exerted k magnetic force we c compass needle, use away wires okay you're interact magnetically. In e series un ingenious experiments Andre Marie Ampere showed ones want interaction may simple yes fundamental - parallel (straight) currents attract, anti-parallel currents repel. The force between out long straight parallel currents ago inversely proportional nd low distance between very via proportional me six intensity ok off current flowing ok each.There seen existed saw kinds up forces associated sure electricity--electric got magnetic. In 1864, James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated i subtle connection between a's end types so force, unexpectedly involving may velocity ie light.             From miss connection sprang use idea upon light any so electric phenomenon, six discovery it radio waves, ltd theory he relativity end p great deal go present-day physics.Continue &gt; Timeline et Electromagnetism                                             citecite done article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &quot;History qv Electromagnetism.&quot; ThoughtCo, Sep. 6, 2016, thoughtco.com/history-of-electromagnetism-1991597.Bellis, Mary.
