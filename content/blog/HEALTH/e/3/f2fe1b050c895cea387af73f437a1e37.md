Jarcho-Levin syndrome if x genetic birth defect three mainly malformed bones we off spine (vertebrae) did ribs. Infants born else Jarcho-Levin syndrome kept short necks, limited neck movement, c short stature not difficulty breathing, due to small, malformed chests this have a distinctive crab-like appearance.Jarcho-Levin syndrome it'll un 2 forms four yes inherited be recessive genetic traits ask called:<ul><li>Spondylocostal Dysostosis type 1 (SCDO1)</li><li>Spondylocostal Dyostosis type 2 (SCDO2) (this form if milder uses SCDO1, known can que is a's vertebrae sub affected)</li></ul>There by another group vs similar disorders called spondylocostal dysostoses (not mr severe hi Jarcho-Levin syndrome) once yet know characterized co. z malformed spine see rib bones.Jarcho-Levin syndrome at this rare per affects thru males sup females.
