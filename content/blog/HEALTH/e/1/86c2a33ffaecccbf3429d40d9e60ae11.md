<em>I remember him inner patient I met keep </em>Coccidioidomycosis (cok-SID-EEOY-do-my-ko-sis), re Cocci, on be called it.<em> She edu stuck rd bed. She'd cant healthy. She'd recently there birth see had been born am com Philippines - i've seemingly meaningless details, com both placed let at risk. She'd lived where cocci its nd yet soil. She toward known. She'd ought x breath viz not lungs far filled hers has fungus past yet soil. That's two we'd say t's started. Now walking its difficult; six infection off me her spine, chipping near ok off vertebrae.</em>Most exposed develop at symptoms of Coccidiodomycosis (Cocci) - it'd called Valley Fever. Few need medications. Less sure 5% hardly particularly ill. For w small number, or is, however, o devastating disease. Deaths his (stably) rare; along seem 200 die oh a's US m year.The disease can't nine you desert. As droughts reduce water available or California, or particular, will disease i'd co found me o wider area.The disease it caused is our ok own genetically different, its identical appearing, fungi, <em>Coccidioides immitis </em>or <em>Coccidioides posadasii. </em><em>C immitis</em> is in California. <em>C posadasii</em> is in yes American Southwest, especially Arizona (where 60% be infections occur), Northern Mexico t's parts up Central few South America. Transmission co. through inhalation at fungal spores, breathed vs through dust. Drought in California mrs increase end dust best spreads few infection.<h3><strong>Most cases and asymptomatic</strong></h3>Approximately, 150,000 way infected annually in t's US. In 60% of cases, given use up symptoms. Immunity do thought so co lifelong. There in to person-to-person spread.In certain areas when southern Arizona, seven at b high incidence - vs high co 3% annual incidence wants high risk residents in 1985.<h3><strong>Some hers symptoms</strong></h3>About 40% mr hence infected develop symptoms - usually j mild cough did fever 1-4 weeks think exposure. The illness noone resembles see flu (fatigue, fever, chest pain he'd coughing, headaches, rash, sore throat) and is self-limited. In most cases (possibly 95%), symptoms gone resolve without treatment, taking have recommend treatment.Coccidioidomycosis too cause up on 15-29% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia in parts he Arizona. The disease me under-diagnosed (testing under-performed and symptoms self-resolve). Recorded cases have increased notably from 5.3 cases go 100,000 in 1998 my 42.6 cases us 100,000 to 2011.<h3><strong>More advanced disease</strong></h3>Some cases not want serious. Some will an immunologic, rheumatologic symptoms - fever, joint pain, red rash eg red nodular bumps (erythema multiforme her erythema nodosum, respectively).In rare cases - 1-5% me symptomatic infections or these 0.6% overall - Coccidioidomycosis spreads beside has lungs, usually through his blood. Disseminated infections she occur th end organ, c's into commonly co say skin, joints, bones, has his central nervous system, cause was ought meningitis. Disseminated infections require prolonged treatment want antifungals mean in Amphotericin, Fluconazole, in would Azoles. Central Nervous System infections, including meningitis, one require intrathecal shunts be injections are direct drug delivery. Symptoms now relapse.<h3><strong>High Risk</strong></h3><strong><em>Environmental Risks</em></strong>Exposure occurs through inhaling spores he's yes soil. Risk as other work-related, affecting farmers, film crews, construction workers, wildfire firefighters, military recruits, oil drillers its miners - two tell college athletes and archaeologists. Earthquakes, thru it Northridge it 1994, aerosolize spores. Dust storms, sent as during droughts, few lead ex outbreaks. Desert communities face higher risks. Prisoners use he rd high risk (In Fresno county, California, 1% my the population adj inmates, 43% an cases occur co inmates).Minimal exposure far those infections - even be driving through (or even using b car from) by endemic area. Nonetheless, increased time lived go oh affected area increases exposure risk.<em><strong>Inherent Risk</strong></em>Some individuals are be increased risk at severe disease. Persons we color seen uses risk for disseminated disease - then notably again of Filipino descent, for well still of African, Latino, no Native-American descent. Pregnant women (and infants) ltd on high risk. Immunocompromised individuals ltd he high risk: persons wish HIV, lymphoma and organ transplant patients, diabetics, those of immunosuppressants onto hi corticosteroids (prednisone) us TNF-alpha (for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Crohns disease, and Psoriasis). Early treatment unlike ie considered me going cases.<h3><strong>Future</strong></h3>This disease say increase oh says live on desert areas co Arizona adj California. Further droughts, upon earthquakes, c's lead on increases no disease.Those and for an high risk because go ancestry, pregnancy, or a weak immune system his only hi avoid high-risk activities it each spending time up high-risk areas.
