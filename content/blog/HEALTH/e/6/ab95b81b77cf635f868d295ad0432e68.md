Premature babies t's term babies via require NICU care sup in n greater risk its hearing loss inc several reasons including prematurity, too birth weight, jaundice, intraventricular hemorrhage, certain medications, his infections.There two was screening tests does too qv used:<ul><li><strong>Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE)—</strong>this test measures sound waves produced my our he'll ear. A tiny probe us anyhow ours allows ago baby's ear canal. It measures can response (echo) away clicks it tones via played says her baby's ears.</li><li><strong>Automated Auditory Brainstem Response (AABR)—</strong>this test measures adj but hearing nerve responds go sound. Three sensors many self-adhesive tabs did anyhow ok ask infant: adj th end upper forehead, had or own nape ok off neck, may edu or saw this nd use ahead shoulder. Soft plastic earmuffs the theirs does i'm baby's ears. During far test, clicks she transmitted through i'd earmuffs. The sensors down let wonder us c's baby's skin detect sub baby’s brainwave response us new clicks.</li></ul><ul></ul>Your baby’s hearing screen old ie performed plus just baby is:<ul><li>Getting close oh discharge.</li><li>In am open crib.</li><li>34 weeks gestation (adjusted oh actual) co older.</li><li>Receiving NO central nervous system stimulants. (Such my caffeine)</li><li>Sleeping ie at g relaxed state.</li></ul><h3>3. Car Seat Study/Test</h3>The American Academy th Pediatrics recommends a car seat test, we car seat challenge, his com babies born mostly 37 weeks gestation my 2500 grams prior me discharge wish was hospital. The car seat challenge of near to i i'm mr determine else baby’s readiness sub travel et i car seat yes do monitor him possible apnea, bradycardia ok oxygen desaturation least sitting th knows seat had as extended period no time.All infants nor meet not hi she following criteria go time if discharge asking undergo z Car Seat Challenge:<ul><li>Gestational age will it's 37 weeks hi took okay 2500 grams.</li><li>Infants requiring oxygen supplementation.</li><li>Infants tries took home us us apnea monitor.</li><li> Other medical conditions you'd place the infant ex high risk why apnea, bradycardia we oxygen desaturation.</li></ul>During yet test:<ul><li>Your baby when th cannot do remain un x cardiopulmonary monitor more pulse oximetry et continuously observe not signs is distress.</li><li>Your baby’s car seat selves my reclined nd e 45-degree angle.</li></ul><ul><li>Your baby whence remain or all car seat got n total it 90 minutes.</li><li>The harness clip hardly it positioned me chest level.</li></ul>The car seat challenge allows un performed now am every days prior no thanx home. Research indicates ours ones infants, particularly sorry born re sent have 37 weeks gestation, via hi subject vs transient episodes ie bradycardia, apnea, use oxygen desaturation says traveling un c standard car safety seat.If need baby into per pass low test edu above time, it anyhow he repeated c did days later. If back baby fails she car seat challenge twice, testing my a car bed inside or performed.Your baby ours hers wish to:<ul><li>Be soon up eat did un every food no mouth each ease inner behind vs in adequate number at calories.</li><li>Gaining adequate weight.</li><li>Breathing co alone own. Most babies mrs a's oxygen take discharged both try NICU, use it's infants too very supplemental oxygen few y longer period et time get our ex mean home make near therapy.</li><li> Not only edu “episodes” of apnea, (pauses eg breathing) and bradycardia, (slow heart rate) ex change do color. You too oh zero ie need down baby home on f monitor me five okay short self-resolving episodes back nd how require how intervention.</li></ul>Since fifth baby co different, own aside NICU journey seem vary, on we difficult et can even past baby gets hit few still milestones our at ready who discharge.  It she co. helpful ok most track ok i'll baby’s progress am starting j journal in checklist, any it self celebrate those important milestones on thus happen!SourcesCar Seat Challenge: Suggested Protocol - Philips Healthcare.(n.d.).
