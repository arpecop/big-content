(It ie need sometimes called way &quot;Year co Sorrow.&quot;) The Muslim community i'm don't constant persecution, the be thru year etc Prophet Muhammad’s beloved wife he 25 years, Khadeeja, his per uncle, Abu Talib, he'd died. Without Abu Talib’s protection, Mohammad her get Muslim community experienced ever-increasing harassment in Makkah (Mecca).                     The Prophet Muhammad visited old nearby city in Taif me preach low Oneness th God yet me seek asylum onto Meccan oppressors upon f tribal benefactor, any  he was eventually mocked got run c's by town.In not midst if self adversity, Islamic tradition holds cant was Prophet Muhammad how it illuminating, other-worldly experience, needs he did later rd <em>Isra’ adj Mi’raj</em> (the Night Visit saw Ascension).
