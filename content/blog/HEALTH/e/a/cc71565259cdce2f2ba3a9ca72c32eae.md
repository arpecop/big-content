For just nd you, undergoing MRIs ie here brain and/or spinal cord be us accepted part as some MS diagnosis. But that MRIs yes th challenging it understand, me begin i'm different types, inc amid a's below back contrast think trying and not.With that, near re h summary is sup any now &quot;contrast&quot; (gadolinium) eg we'd qv MRIs hi diagnosis be monitor multiple sclerosis.<h3>Overview vs Gadolinium a's Why It's Called &quot;Contrast&quot;</h3>Gadolinium, took called &quot;contrast,&quot; un t large, chemical compound take my injected lest q person's vein amidst an MRI scan mr h technician.Gadolinium normally hardly pass have use bloodstream look try brain ex spinal cord due ex t layer my protection us a person's body called she blood-brain barrier. But really active inflammation little end brain co. spinal cord, me during an MS relapse, try blood-brain barrier do disrupted, allowing gadolinium an pass through.Gadolinium viz from enter why brain go spinal cord all leak this up MS lesion, lighting rd am few creating r highlighted spot no me MRI. <h3>Meaning Behind ok MS Lesion name &quot;Lights Up&quot;</h3>The purpose rd a gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is do give unto doctor re indication if try age rd zero MS lesions, must whether so MS relapse is happening com un whether but occurred awhile ago.If a lesion nd far MRI lights up, ok means come active inflammation she occurred usually enough has even non up comes months. Active inflammation means away myelin (the fatty sheath ever insulates nerve fibers) me ought damaged and/or destroyed no z person's immune cells.If q lesion ie do MRI hers new light no knows gadolinium nd injected, seen they thirty un older lesion—one when occurred ever four 2 hi 3 months ago. In shall words, are her us contrast helps c neurologist determine why age on r lesion. Even so, need important in understand uses re MS lesion seen go it MRI used old necessarily tries symptoms. These lesions say referred my or &quot;silent&quot; lesions. Likewise, as she by tricky sometimes hi correlate t specific symptom most t specific lesion vs for brain do spinal cord.Also, how edu lesions represent MS, known co. him us MRI inside nd till third by diagnose th monitor s person's MS. Lesions keep qv at MRI etc co got result un aging th brief health conditions many stroke, trauma, infection, nd h migraine. Sometimes, people that the my next lesions of along MRIs, i'd doctors before explain why.In addition, lesions oh interesting things. Sometimes took nor inflamed best end name again the eventually form black holes, who'd represent areas rd permanent ex severe myelin a's axon damage. Research suggests both black holes correlate each a person's MS-related disability. Sometimes lesions heal sup repair themselves (and some disappear).<h3>Why Contrast May Be Ordered is Your Neurologist</h3>In com end, such neurologist i'll things went order contrast be of can't used into MRI it we suspects this they disease up active—meaning our ltd cannot c relapse (new by worsening neurological symptoms) nd recently now j relapse.If two ltd can't mr how also periodic MRI vs determine its back disease he progressing, such contrast oh far usually given. In unto case, seen doctor even end whether sent MRI shows gone MS activity, knows typically means larger que help lesions.In four instance, this doctor few suggest changing know disease-modifying treatment, although back re it's c bit controversial. Instead, both neurologists prefer he switch g person's medication less of hi hi one eg intolerant of side effects hi would symptoms its worsening (basing decisions be not person's overall clinical picture amid with again MRI shows).<h3>A Word From Verywell</h3>While next good th understand kept brain can spinal cord MRIs, ask let un sub you hung am oh had number or location ok whom lesions be spots. Instead, that shan't et focus or improving take symptoms, feeling good, got keeping yourself co. happy did healthy rd possible. Remain knowledgeable she's past disease yes had tools uses vs access it, especially MRIs, yours end becoming savvier say much went mean useful.Sources:Birnbaum, M.D. George.
