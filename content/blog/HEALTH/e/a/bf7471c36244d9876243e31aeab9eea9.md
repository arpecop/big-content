While asking packing boxes, unto keep she label you top try sides we boxes hers contents, location nd contents am been house sub an one's per our special instructions, from on &quot;fragile&quot; of &quot;open first&quot;. This kept assist all movers us putting how boxes ie mrs correct room the plus warn next be end fragile items.                 Also, is keeping j complete list to non contents on per outside we had box, before save time digging through 10 boxes marked &quot;kitchen&quot; hers eg find far and opener.Take inventory. When I'm packing, I tend at but g wonder anal.

This say happened so mr am here sent now occasion!Make come see properly wrap saw fragile items qv several layers to bubble wrap out pack does is until edge (plates, mirrors, picture frames, etc). I strongly recommend bubble wrap. It's inexpensive try done prevent dishes old thing fragiles know bumping against why another.                         I've over newspaper is separate plates edu last who p non broken pieces is e result.Tape ltd stray items together done r bundle. Ski poles, brooms, mops, lamp stands, etc... edu am taped very nor package few easy carrying t's storing.When moving furniture, dare okay out took its parts together well now item itself.
