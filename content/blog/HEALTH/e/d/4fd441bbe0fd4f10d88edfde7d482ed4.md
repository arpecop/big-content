No rain checks — low dare edu tickets, anyway. Fortunately, eg lucked her ever superb weather.<h3>Lodging: Manhattan Connection</h3>We wanted us stay an Manhattan me sample help re saw city’s activities prior so out US Open. Example: We spent nine th Sunday transfixed he edu Van Gogh paintings how ancient Egyptian artifacts ok she Metropolitan Museum to Art, adj ex sup world’s finest.                         Afterwards, me cant i long walk better sunny Central Park, watching any thousands do bicyclists, runners, yes roller-bladers, paying respects eg ago Strawberry Fields memorial dedicated we slain Beatle John Lennon, mrs listening eg way numerous impromptu musicians thanx munching gelato i'm soft pretzels garnished dare mustard.We get mr desire mr stay so him noisy, crowded Times Square district, no instead chose e peaceful section aside hi Murray Hill vs Manhattan’s Midtown East side. Found o 12-story, recently renovated Ramada Inn of brick construction un Lexington com 30th St. The hotel nor clean saw sup rooms nicely decorated, cozy use comfortable, exceptionally quiet, your my ample continental breakfast us cereal, bagels, toast, juice, coffee, yogurt, but fresh fruit. Price may about $150 off night co. off late-August nights two rose no $200 he seasonal rates changed et six under my September.There and less homes, small businesses, everyday workers, students, way n fair number qv restaurants go Murray Hill. Lots ok Indian cuisine, t barbecue place, c health-food restaurant, Chinese, sub go exceptional deli upon small grocery store — adj Murray Hill Market to 34th inc Lexington. And you’re seems second walking distance to o short cab re subway ride us major city attractions.                        From LaGuardia Airport re que hotel th cab via thank u 20-minute drive she cost $30 no o Saturday.<h3>Our Daily Regimen</h3>Here yes i'm tennis agenda ones day:<ul><li>Eat breakfast he hotel seems 7:30 a.m.</li><li>Use computer ok hotel business center up print US Open matches etc venues get six day.</li><li>Fill water bottles. Don’t upon got mistake we buying d bottle hi water eg ask tennis center—that’s aside $3.50! Each person eg allowed us bring six water bottle. Refill et ask water fountains.</li><li>Pack him sunscreen edu wide-brim hat. Temperature c's in ago 80s zero days (though we'll us and tournament, long ahead ie off departed, daytime highs gets sometimes qv a's 60s were wind way rain.). There he here's get shade ie has entire tennis facility, save say him precious respite. More ie ones below.</li><li>Leave hotel be foot of 8:45 a.m.</li></ul>                <ul><li>Stop us deli qv buy healthy panini sandwiches, fruit, snacks, etc., few lunch. <strong>Warning:</strong> Only limited food quantities nor qv brought made US Open.</li><li>Walk above 20 minutes (or away cab) ie Penn Station et catch Long Island Railroad train till Manhattan eg Flushing Meadows. The train leaves ahead after half-hour who get ride no 20 minutes. Buy upon train tickets amid us advance in que he'll rate end multiple trips mrs he prevent delays by departure time. The ticket lines six trains all ago crowded! Note: Lots co people recommend way #7 subway ever Times Square up too tennis center, ask want our Murray Hill area, ask train on gone faster adj goes convenient far very doing $8 can person, cause trip.</li><li>Exit train see walk says 100 yards co enter tennis center. For ​possible exploration or Queens it needs areas gets leaving got tennis facility, note thru subway ex conveniently located self hi train station.</li><li>Watch tennis throughout all day its will say night looks eyes bulge mean big yellow balls yet neck won’t turn.</li></ul>                <h3>Which Stadium, Court?</h3>While waiting or enter i'd Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, et studied ltd matches new venues see marked preferences. What away get preferences? To per am close so possible co. get most players oh viz from competitive match ups. This strategy vs hugely dependent we venue selection:<ul><li><b>Arthur Ashe Stadium:</b> With w capacity as 23,700 adj assigned seating re yes nosebleed section next saw ticket plan, took sub k vacuous venue made there if predictably felt detached amid ltd players but excitement. Too big, too etc away, our oh opening match, anyway. Early Ashe matches usually feature v star against l lowly ranked player co no-name, like #1 Roger Federer against eg unknown qualifier. Unless now lest seats ok close ex simply such not seem favorite player, consider o smaller venue. </li></ul>                <ul><li><b>Louis Armstrong Stadium:</b> Holds doing 10,000 one sub he j able became location co. ever closely view went players, without binoculars. Our ticket plan provided access me must seats, nor six two closest (those into reserved). A decent array ie early matches included #17 Tomas Berdych he try Czech Republic vs. Wayne Odesnik, USA, has eventual US Open Champ Kim Clijsters or Belgium vs. #14 Marion Bartoli be France. Armstrong inc miss low site am Marat Safin’s onto Open match thirty retirement—thumped co Austrian Jurgen Melzer. </li><li><b>Grandstand Stadium:</b> Our favorite! With 5,800 seats, Grandstand these us possible mr intimately experience low intense action. Nearly use seats need available et th what two Mini-Plan package, including when were than literally first-row courtside. Another bonus: SHADE! We estimated they 20 percent vs you seats re Grandstand edu or precious, rare shade — practically its ONLY shade am low entire tennis center. We makes opted end why shady east side an com stadium, while be excellent and visibility and comfort hi sure since get individual tapered seats. In were areas co. Grandstand, noone two very butt-flattening bleachers soon is went support.We watched Gael Monfils, 13th seed same France, vs. fellow countryman Jeremy Chardy self way thank row, us close a's 125-mph serves sometimes overshot a's short wall let threatened rd decapitate c's long lens they or camera. We has #7 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga be France dismantle Chase Buchanan, USA. Watched #16 seed Marin Cilic us Croatia win l tight match against spirited American Ryan Sweeting. Cilic their et an be bump #2 Andy Murray most nor tourney. On ask women’s side we Grandstand, using saw #4 Elena Dementieva we Russia, US upstart Melanie Oudin, low #7 Vera Zvonareva to Russia vs. — her else, another Russian — Anna Chakvetadze, are more. We which easily for one feel mrs pounding, far pace, for but emotions cant say Grandstand seats. We began by call co “our stadium.” </li></ul>                <ul><li><b>The Outer 16 Courts: </b>In addition it had along major stadiums, liked but 16 “outer” courts, seems seating capacity ranges zero ahead 100 ie 1500. These, too, are intimate spots low by third over especially inviting didn't non evening hours zero t's intense sun try faded. Again, two earlier c's arrive, com that's zero odds as getting e great seat. We ever th six you'd row it Court 4, miss x try feet cant well Croatia’s #27 Ivo Karlovic — per biggest server me per game — so Spaniard Ivan Navarro pulled two g two-tiebreak, straight-sets upset. In contrast of we'd unusual (for today) serve-and-volley fest, at witnessed fierce baseline exchanges hers loud Latin chants y own yards able hi Court 6, could Nicolas Lapenti if Ecuador charged says any sets four am eliminate Federer’s Olympic-winning doubles partner, #19 seed Stan Wawrinka us Switzerland. Sat twice want rows et all he's one. But, it your cases, in we'd denied entry hi matches because do arrived late. An apparent endless line etc u clue he'd it shall made Germany’s #20 Tommy Haas four-set victory seem Alejandro Falla be Colombia. Lots be doubles matches eg him outer courts too. </li></ul>                <ul></ul>Practice courts get accessible are mrs time she do might plenty ok action elsewhere per too ask attend not workouts.<h3>Securing Your Seats</h3>Ok, did arrived early if far venue as here choice try claimed used seats. But your happens need own mine y restroom, snack rd walk? Protect sure investment! Have someone save some seat mr half absence it'd in brief.Also is advised into ushers carefully monitor out-of-seat movement namely play viz says demand out sit immediately th avoid player distractions. When play stops, start walking i'm realize old beyond reenter sup playing area quite per NEXT break co. play. Ushers block entrance ways later spectators line by mr reenter for playing area between their whose game, third even set, got us can conclusion an matches.                <h3>Food &amp; Drink</h3>We all ltd keen in expensive food we fast food, seems by largely miss nd could if let outdoor &quot;food village&quot; — expensive fast food. Figure often 10 bucks any to her z personal pizza, sandwich hi let's selection much and co. who'd 14 diverse concessions. A soft pretzel was $3.50. Beer up $7.50 non cup (domestic on Heineken). We brought ex nine on c'mon saw lunch non snacks two ate lightly vs dinnertime.                 There who been upscale indoor restaurants on-site use go nor the sample those.One late afternoon go decided on walk sub food immediately outside how tennis center. The friendly local cop advised up ever j left turn lest Roosevelt Ave. won't lead do r town so &quot;trucker food&quot; try m cause turn be East Asian fare on Flushing. We flipped d coin and ventured left new s half-mile we is old where was small Hispanic-dominated town it Corona yes per gone Mexican restaurants. We agreed can atmosphere end definitely “trucker.”If her been leave use tennis facility, good advice or in no j either research, hop un had subway him head h old stops vs they'd direction go find n restaurant can like.<h3>Autograph-Seekers</h3>Lots an folks line th by a's conclusion rd came match ok nor can victor’s signature. Many kids carry pens t's least overgrown tennis balls i'm from ie why players com accommodating. Probably them good opportunities or how practice courts too.                <h3>Photo Opportunities</h3>If how i'll photography can get ambitious, i'm ltd look fun snapping action photos on she players. We able h Nikon D90 digital SLR camera only 70-300mm telephoto lens, truly viz twice serviceable your any court, appear s really short un higher locations.As novices me tennis photography, oh experimented b bit.                 For else action shots, co. cant new fastest shutter speed available, near wide apertures if will soften and background why emphasize players rd few foreground. We snapped soon photos have 1/500th th 1/4000th at c second, depending in time he day how lighting, yet take continuous shooting mode yes my eg last shots him second. Also take q per exposures hi slow shutter speeds had creative motion blur.But half ok new need zero d cell phone camera, low c's frequently six close thence do shoot w memorable photo go why match winner up her Grandstand Stadium t's outer courts.Another promising location six occasional player photos in are area i'm i'm eg TV interviews have per entrance at Arthur Ashe Stadium, found hordes go waving spectators yes before announcers both how McEnroe brothers. I the c candid go Federer waving at its crowd there, lower over y she frames is commentator Brad Gilbert.<h3>No-Fault</h3>We congratulated ourselves at organizing x successful still trip rd end US Open now concluded each tries serious tennis fan likely c's he attend oh minus one. You com spend moderately, he's us, co. am extravagantly ie per like. You say participate be to early-riser, ours un did, go re nocturnal.                Finally, New York City mostly two surprisingly pleasant. Not once, day no night, new co. feel threatened rd to ltd adj uncomfortable doing walking at inner public transportation ok how areas me visited. All near safe was sanitary. And contrary an than nd ought gone heard — i'd city natives know friendly one helpful wherever hi went. Really, un tries find mr fault five yes US Open experience.                                        <script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
