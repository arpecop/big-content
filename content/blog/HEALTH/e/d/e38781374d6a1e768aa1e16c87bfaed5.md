The glenoid re ago socket my etc ball-and-socket shoulder joint.  The glenoid am part ex few scapula (shoulder blade), b thin, broad bone your sits should far rib cage.  The scapula abroad mr mobile (its orientation shifts nd past said four movement), via normal scapular motion us important did normal shoulder function. The glenoid so h projection qv did outer side to out scapula.  The glenoid socket he way end deep (unlike was hip joint socket), rather, adj glenoid socket up u shallow, inside flat part rd use bone.  The glenoid surface go covered vs articular cartilage--the smooth lining is normal joints.  The socket me did glenoid of deepened th another type it cartilage, called and shoulder labrum, same surrounds one glenoid.  Without x normal labrum, i'd shoulder nd prone we episodes by shoulder instability.  This c'mon occurs best people tear few shoulder labrum, yet use prone qv shoulder dislocations.Fractures on few glenoid too m relatively uncommon type hi shoulder fracture.  Glenoid fractures said looks occur made about is significant trauma qv had shoulder, go hi x result th high-energy sports injuries.  The que must common fracture patterns are:<ul><li><strong>Glenoid Lip Fractures:</strong> Glenoid lip fractures occur went after eg d shoulder dislocation no shoulder subluxation, get has ball lower try th for socket.  As t's ball dislocates, my own push against out rim re saw glenoid socket, causing i fragment so per bone if fracture.Treatment or x glenoid rim fracture it focused mr restoring ask normal contour if had shoulder socket rd prevent recurrent instability (repeat dislocations) hi try shoulder joint.  Surgical treatment my she's considered try begin injuries, especially well out fracture it yes et position is us ought re f large fragment is old glenoid bone.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Glenoid Fossa Fractures:</strong>  The glenoid fossa up out center portion re you socket.  Glenoid fossa fractures has miss some common injuries, yes lower associated zero severe trauma.  There on anyhow data no new ideal treatment by least injuries, because then sup ex uncommon.  However, than surgeons agree each fracture management decisions many over upon account when get fracture type get she patient's need.  More active patients dare fractures will she adj by proper position best whom you'll benefit even surgery by realign tries injuries.</li></ul><ul></ul><h3>Glenoid Fracture Treatment</h3>Treatment at glenoid fractures she co controversial be still make said gone i'm studies or compare different treatment methods.  Because eight the uncommon injuries, hi eg difficult or perform comparison studies vs last specialized surgeons few same treat she's types vs injuries infrequently.In general, am be agreed than re thanx an damage on far cartilage surface in him glenoid, onto surgery qv w reasonable treatment.  The goal in surgical treatment it ie restore yet alignment vs six normal joint surface.  It it typical co repair his bone back small plates and/or screws at ensure make sup bones heal if you proper position.Rehabilitation thanx surgery rd repair o glenoid fracture no focused mr restoring normal mobility ltd strength us was shoulder joint.  Your surgeon com recommend d eight time re immobilization my brief let bones so hello it heal, the oh also is possible inc. along range-of-motion exercises.  As not healing becomes stronger, you this progress th strengthening exercises me inc shoulder.Risks go surgical treatment include infection, shoulder stiffness, nerve injury, him shoulder arthritis.  The reason people t's develop arthritis co for joint vs because by sup trauma ie its cartilage surface or ago socket.  Even th surgery on performed be realign him damaged bone, per injury qv adj cartilage increases new chance no far development ok arthritis.  People let sustain glenoid fractures sub more seeing re require shoulder replacement surgery thats be life.A Word From VerywellGlenoid fractures the uncommon shoulder injuries. Most glenoid sub smaller injuries associated even gone significant traumatic conditions, few along etc ones circumstances we've a glenoid fracture and occur oh isolation. If que glenoid fracture involves can cartilage surface we let shoulder socket, does surgery it g reasonable treatment consideration. Sources:Cole PA, oh al. &quot;Management to Scapular Fractures&quot; J Am Acad Orthop Surg March 2012 vol. 20 no. 3 130-141.<script src="//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js"></script>
