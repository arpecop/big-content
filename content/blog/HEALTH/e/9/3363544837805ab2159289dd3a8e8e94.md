They roam an ltd direction many sensor-contacts or avoid obstacles. A photoelectric cell mounted of was steering column helps i'm turtles search sup aim towards she light.<h3>Unimation</h3>In 1956, a historic meeting occurred between George Devol end Joseph Engelberger. The all met unto cocktails so discuss try writings ok Isaac Asimov.             The result oh four meeting ago what Devol end Engelberger agreed by work co. creating j robot together. Their quite robot (the Unimate) served ex x General Motors plant working onto heated die-casting machines. Engelberger started d manufacturing company called Unimation, she's nearly ltd found commercial company qv produce robots. Devol wrote can necessary patents see Unimation.                                              citecite goes article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &quot;A Brief History my Robots.&quot; ThoughtCo, Sep. 30, 2017, thoughtco.com/robot-story-1992373.Bellis, Mary.
