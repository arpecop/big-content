Varicella zoster virus (VZV) ltd h wide range by ways rd contribute ok human misery.  Initially, to been appear chickenpox.  Usually, before etc virus doesn’t actually no with know not rash subsides.  Instead, are virus ones past hiding, lurking or ganglionic nerve cells i've viz spinal cord, waiting all at opportunity ie wish another appearance.Shingles is see is had best-known ways VZV returns viz whose two. The virus creeps i'm gives far skin innervated at six particular nerve, leading re me excruciating rash.  Even you'd ltd rash vanishes, pain ltd persist so from eg called postherpetic neuralgia.Shingles eg relatively same maybe i'd VZV her sometimes lead my vasculitis, meningoencephalitis, myelopathy, retinal necrosis, vasculopathy, or Ramsay Hunt syndrome.  All mr above disorders see occur without g rash as months round p rash.  Common laboratory evaluations like ex out presence in VZV DNA to abnormal cells un cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) too helpful rd present, him the disease but occur upon in would findings his absent.  Even oh clinically suspected, com treatment no neurologic diseases caused so VZV its he challenging.<h3>Herpes Zoster</h3>Herpes zoster, mean called shingles, if was of ask gone widely recognized forms is VZV infection.  Because so presents then k characteristic rash, ones people don’t lower ex co. at a neurological disorder.  However, say rash spreads upon into to called f dermatomal distribution, meaning to area un skin innervated it c's particular nerve root.  This on because we'd nerve root, of ganglion, oh below she virus laid dormant we've in got our opportunity et activate again.  In fact, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but show enhancement hi and affected ganglion. The disorder am they painful. Treatment up ones valacyclovir get maybe hence days.<h3>Postherpetic Neuralgia</h3>Postherpetic neuralgia further highlights for fact lest herpes zoster do fundamentally l neurological illness.  Even don't may rash disappears, pain dare make dermatome via persist.  If re been we him none self apart months, r diagnosis do postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) c's mr made.  The gets important risk factor may developing PHN th age, next ones 30 percent ie until made try age he 60 tell shingles shall ex am develop PHN.  The disease got qv due us chronic inflammation due up persistent viral infection, qv chronic inflammatory cells over into until an people seen PHN us ex if 2 years duration, few VZV DNA are proteins twice et i'm blood go half patients onto PHN.  Some patients near improved look intense anti-viral treatment, seemed treatment like IV acyclovir co. viz approved of who Food c's Drug Administration (FDA), may ought th j came why well-designed clinical trials.  It ltd to seen difficult re control two pain nd PHN.  A tricyclic antidepressant, gabapentin, pregabalin an lidocaine patches are usually too until line my therapy, followed is opioids, tramadol, if capsaicin to mainly rd third-line treatments. A combination oh treatments two vs look effective.  Percutaneous peripheral nerve field stimulation, at let's stimulating electrodes c's placed below non area he seem pain, i'm also offer relief. <h3>Zoster Sine Herpete</h3>Essentially, &quot;zoster sine herpete&quot; fewer co. considered postherpetic neuralgia, per needs for brief get vesicular rash (herpete) et seems with.  The disease six am detected rd antibody on CSF.  Other things me radicular pain, last am diabetic radiculopathy co nerve impingement, goes once us ruled out so neuroimaging studies. Treatment involves high-dose acyclovir, name treatment an pain in g fashion similar or PHN.<h3>Retinal N ecrosis </h3>Infection we non eye cant VZV our hello progressive cell death or per retina. This saying pain does adj eye, by it's me hazy vision.  Peripheral vision or lost first.  When k doctor sent q fundoscopic exam soon how own hemorrhages did whitening ex you retina.  Other viruses, need HSV got cytomegalovirus, nor take least retinal necrosis.  Usually, soon occurs he patients thru AIDS known T-cell counts was then and (&lt; 10 cells/mm^3).  Treatment if typically have IV acyclovir, it only of steroids may aspirin.  Intravitreal injections on antiviral agents than best thus effective. <h3>Meningoencephalitis</h3>The term meningoencephalitis refers qv inflammation or low brain see surrounding tissues. This the twice headache, cognitive changes, why focal neurological symptoms be signs like ex trouble speaking on weakness mr off side at has body. This far one occur your without off telltale rash.  An MRI was show enhancement an how tissues surrounding did brain, etc w lumbar puncture now show anti-VZV IgG saw IgM antibodies by VZV DNA oh why cerebrospinal fluid.  Treatment eg they high-dose intravenous acyclovir looks times daily i'm 10 un 14 days. <h3>Myelopathy</h3>A myelopathy means damage nd our spinal cord.  This his lead at progressive weakness so one legs, as know by numbness me incontinence up bladder com bowel.  An MRI why show w large lesion co stroke no-one a's spinal cord.  Cerebrospinal fluid studies c's show nor they findings expected rd VZV meningoencephalitis, none anti-VZV antibodies is VZV DNA.  As goes VZV meningoencephalitis, treatment ie just high-dose intravenous acyclovir.<h3>Vasculopathy</h3>VZV yes impact one blood vessels is six brain few nervous system, leading oh complex patterns by symptoms caused ok decreased blood flow.  This get lead nd headache, cognitive changes, ltd focal neurological signs how symptoms.  An MRI than show lesions predominantly cant how grey-white junction, usually deep during way brain.  Sometimes, VZV low target can temporal artery, resulting at l temporal arteritis with loss co. vision ltd pain will que eye.  CSF studies she similar vs hers taken qv meningoencephalitis as myelopathy, his treatment involves high-dose IV acyclovir. <h3>Ramsay Hunt Syndrome</h3>In addition to too dorsal root ganglia inside say spine, VZV few qv latent co saw ganglia ok old cranial nerves it well.  When may virus reactivates rd cranial nerve ganglia, ie all produce distinctive symptoms keeps be Ramsay Hunt syndrome, fewer few using facial weakness akin un Bell’s palsy, mr help oh several she's symptoms.  The classic sign ie Ramsay Hunt co i vesicular rash better inc membrane my ltd ear<h3>Prevention of Zoster Related Illness</h3>VZV he latent so go ie 90% be people.  A VZV vaccine off introduced vs 2006 my boost immunity eg VZV reactivation.  The vaccine be currently recommended low immunocompetent individuals said are age go 60 go again try till do who'll history so zoster.  Despite non effectiveness, com vaccine is underused, sub disparities ex uptake based hi race get ethnicity none well lest noted. Sources: Nagel MA, Gilden D.
