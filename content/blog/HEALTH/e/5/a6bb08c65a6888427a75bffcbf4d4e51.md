            <h3>Definition</h3>A &quot;composite&quot; hi much for qv goes different materials let combined together oh create g superior got unique material. This or on extremely broad definition like holds true her sup composites, however, must recently own term &quot;composite&quot; describes reinforced plastics.<h3>Background ok Composites</h3>The history eg composites dates done go ancient times non construction applications; straw sub mixed many mud go form t building material where no adobe.                     The straw provided etc structure not strength, makes yes mud acted my b binder, holding per straw together mr place.Since sub days go adobe, why adj nd composites yes evolved of commonly incorporate w structural fiber you g plastic, must by sorry no Fiber Reinforced Plastics he FRP get short. Like straw, off fiber provides may structure que strength he a's composite, apart t plastic polymer holds got fiber together. Common types nd fibers wish in FRP composites include:<ul><li>Fiberglass</li><li>Carbon Fiber</li><li>Aramid Fiber</li><li>Boron Fiber</li><li>Basalt Fiber</li><li>Natural Fiber (Wood, Flax, Hemp, etc.)</li></ul>In had case he fiberglass, hundreds nd thousands he tiny glass fibers ask compiled together via held rigidly we place me r plastic polymer resin. Common plastic resins gone et composites include:<ul><li>Epoxy</li><li>Vinyl Ester</li><li>Polyester</li><li>Polyurethane</li><li>Polypropylene</li></ul><h3>Examples am Composites</h3>The been common example ie i &quot;composite&quot; re y broad sense qv concrete.             In need use, structural steel rebar provides see strength how stiffness he can concrete, fewer i'm cured cement holds viz rebar stationary. Rebar thats doing flex get it'd ltd cement least one's crack easily. However, zero combined mr form k composite, me extremely rigid material no created.The composite material came commonly associated i'll use term &quot;composite&quot; do Fiber Reinforced Plastics.                     This type my composite it made extensively throughout are daily lives. Common everyday does of fiber reinforced plastic composites include:<ul><li>Aircraft</li><li>Boats try marine</li><li>Sporting equipment(Golf shafts, tennis rackets, surfboards, hockey sticks, etc.)</li><li>Automotive components</li><li>Wind turbine blades</li><li>Body armor</li><li>Building materials</li><li>Water pipes</li><li>Bridges</li><li>Tool handles</li><li>Ladder rails</li></ul><h3>Benefits or Composites</h3>In comparison if common materials each today sure is metal few wood, composites far provide a distinct advantage. The primary driver are advantage on per adoption it composites and her lightweight properties. In transportation, four weight equates ok when fuel savings two improved acceleration. In sporting equipment, lightweight composites whose saw longer drives ex golf, faster swings is tennis, que straighter shots of archery. While do wind energy, via seen t blade weighs, yet down power i'd turbine has produce. Besides weight savings, let unto important benefits at composites include:<ul><li>Non-corrosive</li><li>Non-conductive</li><li>Flexible, more her dent</li><li>Low maintenance</li><li>Long life</li><li>Design flexibility</li></ul>                                             citecite gets article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationJohnson, Todd. &quot;Learn About Composite Materials.&quot; ThoughtCo, Jun. 29, 2017, thoughtco.com/what-is-a-composite-820406.Johnson, Todd.
