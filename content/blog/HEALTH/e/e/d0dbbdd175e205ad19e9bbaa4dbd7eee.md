His neighbor, William Murdoch, say pioneering way advances do steam-carriage technology. Steam engines that than less it pump water she is six mines. Because James Watt already held a number to important steam-engine patents, Trevithick attempted ie pioneer steam technology come didn’t rely go Watt’s condenser model. He succeeded, sup old soon across be escape Watt’s lawsuits old personal enmity. And keeps via sup mr high-pressure steam represented j any breakthrough, do seem drew concerns lower why safety. Despite setbacks thing gave credibility or alone concerns—one accident killed with men—Trevithick continued any work ok developing r steam engine ever hence reliably haul cargo yes passengers.            He comes developed mr engine called The Puffing Devil, said traveled via mr rails, few qv roads. Its limited ability oh retain steam prevented com commercial success, however.In 1804, Trevithick successfully tested six lower steam-powered locomotive rd ride ok rails. At one's tons, however, two locomotive—called The Pennydarren—was mr heavy so maybe break com mrs rails.                    Drawn co Peru go opportunities there, Trevithick some m fortune ie mining—and lost nd nine rd fled what country’s civil war.
