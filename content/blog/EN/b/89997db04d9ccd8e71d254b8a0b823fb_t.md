         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 1<p>Some people may believe that the whole world has been explored by now because they don’t see any men in big hats driving wooden sailboats around. These people will be surprised to find out that there are still places on earth that are yet to be explored. Below is a list of twelve places on Earth that you will almost certainly never go to.</p> <h2>12. Siberian Sakha Republic</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-755.jpeg"/>Siberia Times <p>The Siberian Sakha Republic is a federal subject of Russia (a republic). The region covers about 20 percent of russia, making it larger than Argentina and a little smaller than India, and has a population of roughly 1 million people. Much of the region is above the arctic circle, a place not known for being very human friendly. The region is largely unexplored due to the extreme weather which on average ranges between -40 degrees fahrenheit and freezing. The Verkhoyansk Range, which is located in this region, is considered the coldest area in the Northern Hemisphere and some of the lowest temperatures ever recorded have been here. Most of the region is covered in permafrost, which is frozen soil. It is so cold that the ground is frozen solid all the time but is not even ice. Due to the extreme cold, it is not possible to trek through the majority of the region without putting your life at serious risk.</p> <h2>11. Vale do Javari</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-756.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The Vale do Javari or Javari Valley, in English, is one of the largest indigenous territories in Brazil. The area is larger than Austria and no modern civilized human has ever set foot in. There are not very many uncontacted groups worldwide in the 21st century, of these uncontacted groups of people, 14 groups live in the Vale do Javari. The area is home to an estimated 3,000 indigenous people with varying sorts of contact with the outside world. The uncontacted indigenous people are estimated to be more than 2,000 individuals belonging to at least 14 tribes. The Brazilian government has made entering the area illegal. The government keeps loose track of the tribes by observing them by air. These indigenous tribes live the way all humans did before the agricultural revolution and the birth of modern civilization. The Fundacao Nacional do Indio , or National indian foundation, had stated that the area has “the greatest concentration of isolated groups in the The Amazon and the world”. In 2009, a plane emergency landed in the area and one of the local tribes found 9 of the 11 survivors. These survivors were flown out of the area by helicopter soon after. The region was also the setting for a National Geographic documentary called ‘The Unconquered: In Search of the Amazon’s Last Uncontacted Tribes’ which documented a 76 day expedition to contact one of the ‘Arrow People’, one of the uncontacted tribes.</p> <h2>10. Mariana Trench</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-757.jpeg"/>Earth.com <p>The Mariana trench is the deepest point in the entire ocean and is located in the Western Pacific, east of the Philippines. It is a 1500 mile long crescent shaped scar in the Earth’s crust. It reaches a maximum known depth of approximately 36,000 feet in a valley known as the Challenger Deep. For perspective, if you were to drop Mount Everest into the valley, its peak would still be a mile underwater. Xenophyophores are the only living things that live that researchers have found to inhabit the region. These are single cell organisms that survive by using minerals in the water to form a exoskeleton. Something scientists have yet to confirm but is probably true is that the trench is home to massive sea monsters. George W. Bush made teh trench a U.S national monument in 2009.</p> <h2>9. Gangkhar Puensum</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-758.jpeg"/>Amusing Travel <p>Gangkhar Puensum or in English, ‘white peak of the three spiritual brothers’ is the fortieth highest mountain in the word, the highest unclimbed mountain, and is roughly 7,500m high. The mountain is located in Bhutan on its border with China. Four teams made attempts to conquer the mountain between 1985 and 1986. All four teams failed due to extreme weather conditions. If you have a burning desire to succeed where these teams failed; you may have to put off your expedition. In 1994, climbing mountains higher than 6000m was banned in the area in order to respect the spiritual belief of the locals. In 2003, mountaineering was banned in the area altogether. Due to so few people having ever been on the mountain at all; the exact geography is up for dispute. Different countries put different areas of the range on different parts of the map. It is likely that Gangkhar Puensum will be unsummited for the foreseeable future.</p> <h2>8. Kamchatka</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-759.jpeg"/>Huffington Post <p>On Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula contains the volcanoes of Kamchatka. This area is hoem to some of the most spectacular volcanic activity on Earth. There exist over 300 volcanoes including one that has been continuously erupting since 1996. The peninsula banned entry to Westerners prior to the fall of the Soviet Union. Even before this, only military personnel were allowed on the peninsula. Large parts of the island remain unexplored.</p>     <h2>7. Son Doong Cave</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-760.jpeg"/>National Geographic <p>Son Doong Cave is the world’s largest cave and is located in Vietnam. This cave is more than 5.5 miles long and deep enough to house a skyscraper. The cave is home to its own river and jungle. Researchers set out to explore the cave in 2009 but were blocked off by a 200 feet calcite wall within. Due to an inability to navigate around the wall, much of the network of caves remains unsurveyed.</p> <h2>6. Star Mountains</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-761.jpeg"/>ABC <p>Star mountains are an enormous mountain range in Papua New Guinea stretching from the country’s border with indonesia to the Hindenburg Range, a neighbouring mountain range which is home to the Hindenburg wall, a series of mile high limestone plateaus. The range is one of the wettest places on Earth and it receives about 10,000mm of rain each year. The area has found its own unique ecosystem and as a result is home to many unique species. One biological survey identified 1,100 species, 100 of which had never feen found anywhere.</p> <h2>5. Yucatan Cenotes</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-762.jpeg"/>Amusing Planet <p>Yucatan cenotes are a large cave network located in mexico. A cenote is a particular cave that is formed when limestone bedrock collapses and exposes groundwater underneath. Many of these caves have not been explored due to the difficulty in getting inside, navigating the caves as well as the fact that they are partly underwater. Even fish know to stay away from the cenotes. If these cenotes weren’t already spooky enough, know that the Ancient Mayans used to use the cenotes for sacrificial purposes.</p> <h2>4. Tsingy de Berahama National Park</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-763.jpeg"/>Flickr <p>Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park is located on the western edge of madagascar. The park centers on two geological formations known as tsingy. The word tsing roughly translates to ‘where one cannot walk barefoot’. This is because groundwater has undercut limestones and cause fissures and caverns to be created. The bizarrely shaped limestone is almost impossible to traverse. The unusual nature of the tsingy means that it is home to a great number of uniques species of organisms.</p> <h2>3. Greenland</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-764.jpeg"/>NPR <p>Despite being a country, large parts of it remain unexplored. The country has an area of 800,000 square miles making it the largest island in the world. The island has a population of roughly 56,000 making it the least densely populated country in the world. The majority of Greenly is uninhabited due to three-quarters of the country being covered by permanent ice sheet. In certain areas the ice can be upto 3,200 m thick and some of the ice is between 400,000 and 800,000 years old. Due to the weather conditions, most of Greenland is still unexplored.</p> <h2>2. Namib Desert</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-765.jpeg"/>Telegraph <p>The Namib Desert is a coastal desert in southern Africa. The desert extends for more than 2,000 kms within the territories of Namibia, South Africa and Angola. Parts of the desert average no more than 2mms of rain per year making it one of the most arid places in the world. The Namib may also be the oldest desert in the world. It is home to very few living creatures, and those that do survive do so on the most minimal amount of water imaginable. A few small indigenous groups of humans also live in the desert but they do so in the less arid regions.</p> <h2>1. North Sentinel Island</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-766.jpeg"/>Forbes <p>North Sentinel Island tops our list because out of all these places; we most advise against visiting this island. The island is located in the bay of bengal and is home to the Sentimalese. The inhabitants reject any sort of contact with the outside world, sometimes even violently. Like Vale do Javari, the island is untouched by the modern world although it is technically under Indian jurisdiction. The Indian government chooses to leaves the Sentimalese alone in order to respect the wishes of the island’s inhabitants. In January, 2006 two fishermen accidentally drifted too close to the island and were subsequently killed by the members of the tribe.</p>     <p>The list is far from comprehensive and there remain lots of unexplored areas on our planet. The majority of Antarctica and the North Pole remain too dangerous to trek, not even considering the majority of deep water. Our list was compiled based on the places we thought were the most interesting. Do you have any other similar places in mind?</p>   <i></i>
