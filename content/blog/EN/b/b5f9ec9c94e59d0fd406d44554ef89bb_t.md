How many of us, who are avid viewers of talk shows immediately tune to the channel where their favorite talk show is aired that support their already established misleading ideologies? Almost all of us. We all have chosen one TV channel and one follow a specific show because it endorses what we already believe. This is where media manipulation has won, and we all are too blind to notice it.</p> <p>Rather than introducing the viewers to the reality that’s happening outside their homes, or globally, our media fabricates stories and present them in such a way that our not-so literate people immediately fall prey into believing its false credibility.</p> <p>It’s true that media proliferation has reached its zenith, inundating people with variegated information. But the question regarding the credibility of this information platform is still seen as a question mark.</p> <p>This article will brief you on the tips that media resort to, to shape the opinion of the masses.</p> <h2>11. Diversion:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-699.jpeg"/>lockerdomecdn.com <p>Our media is pro at this kind of technique. Rather than giving insights to people on the major happenings around the world, it tries to avert their focus from the important news to the insignificant ones. All they need to do is create dramatic headlines and the audience will offer all of their attention to them. This is the reason why social media is flooded with so many irrelevant memes and pics that we all enjoy, while the major news are left ignored.</p> <h2>10. Exaggeration:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-6.png"/>media.licdn.com <p>This is an all-time favorite technique in the field of media. A particular piece of information is overstated with such false authenticity, yet people still believe it. For instance, a particular remark of a celebrity would be so emphasized and will be presented with such additions and subtractions, that it hardly contains the things that were said by that celebrity. Infect, that celebrity himself is surprised by the media, when he listens to the over-exaggerated version of his remark that he never uttered at all.</p> <h2>9. Gradual disclosure:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-702.jpeg"/>pmcvariety <p>Another manipulation strategy that media opts for is the gradual disclosure of information, in the form of small doses. It’s like introducing people to the topic in bits and pieces so that after some time people become advocate to whatever opinion the media was trying to popularize. This tactic is akin to slow poisoning that subtly attacks the masses.</p> <h2>8. Deferred strategy:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-704.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>Because masses have put all of their faith in the information that media delivers, the latter uses this to exploit people by persuading them into making decisions that are not favored by them. However, the media has become so good at it, that it incorporates an emotional aspect into it and pacifies the audience portraying that they are not being harassed into making such decisions quickly, rather they can take them in the future. It depicts that such agonizing decisions are for their better future.</p> <h2>7. Incorporating kindness:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-705.jpeg"/>coastalkids.com <p>One of the powerful tool that media uses is presenting such humane aspects of things that melts people’s hearts within seconds. Media knows us inside-out and they attack the feelings that have the greatest power to override our logical thinking.</p>     <h2>6. Logical VS impulsive:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-74.gif"/>media.tumblr.com <p>This is the most dangerous trick that media resorts to and this leads to a complete massacre of the reality. The rational thinking overpowers the emotional feelings that start to arouse within ourselves and this takes us far from reality. A piece of news with a sentimental element in it is not a genuine one. Because rather than highlighting the facts, people will be more interested in the feelings that it will be reflecting.</p> <h2>5. Keeping the world into oblivion:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-706.jpeg"/>freepik.com <p>Despite being the biggest source of disseminating information, the media keeps us in oblivion. This is majorly attributed to the illiteracy of people, who concur to everything that media states. Thus media exploits such ordinary people by deliberately not revealing the truth. This is also true because majority of the media is controlled by the elite who think that it is in their power to steer the thoughts and beliefs of society. Thus they ensure that people are left groping in ignorance.</p> <h2>4. Mediocrity on the rise:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-707.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>Surf onto any entertainment channel and you will definitely come across a sitcom or an program that is trying to convince you that resorting to rude comments, rash activities or making a dupe of oneself is actually labelled as cool in our society and such people are happily welcomed in the crowd, while those who avert from such activities are actually outcaste.</p> <h2>3. Inducing guilt:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-708.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>This stratagem aims in making people feel culpable for the miseries around the world. It is to make people guilty, that if the world is somehow suffering from an economic crisis, then in some way or the other they have contributed in the tragedy and this leaves people feeling despondent and emotionally frustrated.</p> <h2>2. Knowing you more than you know yourself:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-709.jpeg"/>twimg.com <p>Today media experts are just not satisfied with presenting spurious information. Rather they have become greedy and desire to know more and more about their audiences. Mechanisms have been devised that can capture all sorts of information regarding an individual and then media can publish it out to the world in any way it likes. Even the royal families are not safe from this strategy.</p> <h2>1. Celebrity appeal:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-710.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>Media is aware of the extent to which people worship some of the celebrities. One of the most lucrative and successful tricks that is used to mould public opinion is to hire a celebrity to endorse that specific chain of thought. Within hours you would witness people talking and raving about it. Let the celebrity be Shahrukh Khan or Angelina Jolie, words coming from them are guaranteed to be believed as true.</p> <p>All in all, it is sad to concede that in the current digital landscape, people are still being exploited and manipulated. The fabricated lies that are published and broadcasted are done on the approval of the elite class who are unwilling to educate people fearing that they might surpass their success level. It is hard to believe but we are surrounded with information that is marinated 90% with lies with genuineness being equal to a tea spoon.</p>     <p>It is high time for us to stand against this corrupt attitude because in the long run, these deceptive techniques will prove deleterious for the masses. It is time for us to get out of this illusion of ‘let’s believe it, because media said it’.</p>   <i></i>
