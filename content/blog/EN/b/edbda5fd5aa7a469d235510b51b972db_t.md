         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -3<p>Ladies are infamously secretive about their personal habits to the point where they are said to take a secret to a grave! However, the secrets unearthed in this post are impersonal in the essence that all women are guilty of doing these things at one point or another.</p> <p>These are things that most women do in private but would never be caught talking about publically. It might be because this stuff doesn’t really align with the stereotypical feminine aura women are expected to exude, or because that some of these things are downright disgusting. But hey, we’re allowed to be human, right? We can be prim and proper on the outside and slobbish freaks on the inside!</p> <p>Women might Instagram all their meals and check in wherever they go, but there will always be things they won’t admit to in public. But don’t worry, these things are secrets all women guard together! Here are some embarrassing things most women do but would never admit to.</p> <h2>Stalking anyone and everyone</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-a-352-oshi.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>All girls are guilty of spending hours stalking people on social media. From your ex to his current girlfriend to your second cousin’s husband’s best friend, no one is off limits! It isn’t just that they’re a little nosey, women love being well informed about whatever is happening in everyone else’s life. However, the moment you meet them they will act like they don’t any of the details you’re divulging, even when they had already seen you boast about it on social media. Talk about diplomacy!</p> <p> </p> <h2>Only shaving your legs if they will be showing</h2> <p> </p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-a-352-oshi-18.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Shaving legs or any other place on your body is nothing short of an arduous chore. While some women are breaking free of this cycle, most women still feel the need to shave if their skin is going to on display. This means that as soon as you decide an outfit, out comes the razor and begins the scientific procedure of shaving off as less as possible. Ripped jeans mean shaved knees while cropped one’s mean just shaving half of your calve. Women, hungry for approval and yet lazy sloths at the same time. Fascinating creatures, right?</p> <h2>Ugly cry for no reason at all</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-a-352-oshi-1.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Women are emotional creatures and can well up at the slightest of things. While they try to curb this habit when surrounded by people or in a public setting, they will let the waterworks flow when they’re alone. It can be something as trivial as a ruined eyeliner wing that sets this up but rest assured in knowing that she is, in fact, venting out something much bigger. The best you can do is act supportive instead of ridiculing her feelings!</p> <h2>Practice conversations in the mirror before actually having them</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-a-352-oshi-2.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Women like to be prepared for anything and everything. And in doing so, if they need to act a little crazy, so be it. They will mentally formulate a conversation and execute it in front of a mirror to ensure that it exudes the intended meaning. While it might seem excessive to most, being well prepared never really hurts!</p> <h2>Turn down the volume on your earphones and eavesdrop on conversations around you</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-a-352-oshi-3.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>We have already established women as harmlessly inquisitive by nature. They tend to pry and poke their noses into places where they have no business in doing so. One such instance is communal rides. More often than not, you’ll be sitting next to a harmless looking lady listening to what you assume to be music on her earphones. You tend to ignore her and start jabbering away about your life when in reality, most women tend to lower their headset volumes to get a shot of your conversation. Beware!</p> <h2>Take 20 ‘casual’ selfies before posting just the right one to Instagram</h2> <p><img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-a-352-oshi-4.jpeg"/></p> <p> </p> <p>Shutterstock.com</p> <p>Women are insanely conscious of their image, especially when it comes to public perceptions. A picture that they might want to be perceived as casual can have as many as 20 failed images behind it. Everything, from the lighting to the background is under scrutiny. Not to mention the angles need to be extremely impeccable. Social media is a reflection of your real life, after all! #blessed #wokeuplikethis</p> <h2>‘Accidentally’ snapchat your crush a hot picture and then claim it was for your friend</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-a-352-oshi-5.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Ah, the legendary accidental snap. On a day a woman is looking absolutely great but still doesn’t want to look needy, she’ll take the most amazing selfie and snapchat it to her crush, all while putting him under the pretense that it was not originally meant for him. Not only will it give him a glimpse of how beautiful she is, but he will also end up feeling unimportant and hungry for more. Win-win, right?</p> <h2>They’ll conduct a CIA level search through of their crush / significant other’s social media</h2> <p> </p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-a-352-oshi-6.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Ask any woman around, and you will know that keeping a man is no joke. While it is hard enough to land a keeper, it is even harder to have one stick around. Random searches of their social media is a must. Everything, from the pages they have liked, to the women they are following are observed closely by their significant others. All this is done under the radar of course, without the men being any wiser! So if they keep asking you about a particular someone, chances are that they already know whatever it is that you were trying to hide. Not only would I come clean right away, but I would also avoid hiding anything when I know what lethal trackers women can be!</p> <h2>Have pretend conversations on the phone</h2> <h2></h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-a-352-oshi-7.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Women have this sixth sense that kicks in whenever they feel like they are about to be approached by someone who they aren’t interested in. At times like these, it seems awfully rude to just outrightly reject someone, but you can also not go along with what they are proposing. In a crisis like this, your phone is the only savior you need to turn to. Most women pretend they’re on the phone, attending a call when someone like this approaches it. After all, it is easier to tell someone you are on the phone than reject them!</p>     <h2>Planning their entire wedding on Pinterest</h2> <h2></h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-a-352-oshi-8.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Whether they want to get married or not, all women have been sucked into marriage posts on Pinterest and ended up imagining their entire weddings. From the theme to the location, the centerpieces and the flower choices, their dress and its accessories to where they will go on their honeymoon, the chances are that they have everything planned down to the last dot. Ask them about this, and they will angrily retort that there is more to life than marriage while secretly pinning away more things!</p> <h2>The plethora of selfies</h2> <h2></h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-a-352-oshi-9.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Selfies, selfies and more selfies are what you will find on every woman’s phone. It starts out as something innocent; you are opening your front camera to see if something is stuck in your teeth or if your lipstick is fine and you end up snapping a few dozen pictures or so. How did we even get here?</p> <h2>Weird beauty rituals</h2> <h2></h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-a-352-oshi-10.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>All girls like to feel taken care of pampered. Alas, not many have the deep pockets a deep cleansing requires! The beauty on a budget special requires most women to trust their friend while they try on a new threading technique or slather a weird smelling mixture on their face. While it might not do wonders for their skin, it does strengthen the bond they have with their friends!</p> <h2>Obsess over text messages</h2> <h2></h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-a-352-oshi-11.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Text messages are anything if not small time-sensitive ticking bombs waiting to explode all over your life. Girls will spend hours fixating over what a message might mean and how to reply to it without making unwanted waves in your life. In fact, they might even take the help of their friends to formulate the perfect reply all while pretending that this is a casual conversation they couldn’t care less about having.</p> <h2>Screenshots everywhere</h2> <h2></h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-a-352-oshi-12.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>If you think your conversations with a girl aren’t being screenshotted and forwarded to all her friends, then you, my friend, are just plain old naive. Women are notorious for screenshotting everything you send them, not only just to overanalyze later, but also to maintain a record. Not only them but their entire friend circle knows what you said to her in that particular fight. I’d be scared if I were you. Very scared indeed.</p> <h2>Stuffing essentials into their bras</h2> <h2></h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-a-352-oshi-13.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>While a purse can be a great accessory to tie an outfit together really well, sometimes they can prove to be a hindrance on a fun night out. At times like these, girls turn towards stashing things inside the safety of their own bra. Essentials like money and a credit card can easily be stowed away in their bras without you being any wiser about it. Not only does this mean that there is next to zero chance of their things getting lost, but they will also not have to lug around a bag that requires constant looking after and worry. Full marks for getting the best possible utility out of a product!</p> <h2>Size up another girl the moment you see her</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-a-352-oshi-14.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Women can’t help but be severely competitive especially when it comes to other females. The moment they lay their eyes on someone else for the first time, they start mentally computing and comparing themselves to her. Everything from how accomplished she is professionally, to how she looks and the way she speaks is under tight scrutiny. While this sounds negative in essence, it is nothing but a mental analyzation of where they themselves stand and leads to undoubted self-improvement.</p> <h2>Act like they’re stretching when in reality all they want to do is sniff their armpits</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-a-352-oshi-15.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Women are subjected to insane beauty standards, one of which is where they are expected not to sweat a drop and always smell of flowers and butterflies. While this is clearly impossible, women do tend to be conscious of body odor. A great way to check for sweat stains and bad smells is to act like you’re stretching and then try to smell yourself, inconspicuously of course. So the next time you see a woman stretching exaggeratedly, and for very long, you’ll know what’s up!</p> <h2>Lie about their size</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-a-352-oshi-16.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>As discussed before, being a woman and having to bear the brunt of impossible beauty standards go hand in hand. You are expected to be a certain shape and size, no matter how your body naturally is. Most women turn to underselling their weight or their size, in the hopes that people will perceive them to be smaller than they are. While it might seem sneaky of them, imagine the emotional trauma they must have had to go through to have to lie about who they are to everyone they meet.</p> <h2>Wear the same tights for a week</h2> <h2></h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-a-352-oshi-17.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com     <p>While they might claim to have seven pairs of black leggings, you can trust the fact that they, in reality, have only three, two of which are torn from getting stuck in various bits and pieces of furniture. Given their conditions, no woman bats an eye at picking something up from the floor, sniffing it to see how vile it really smells and then putting it back on. In fact, some women even pull out something right out of the dirty laundry provided it goes with their outfit. After all, she is the only one who wears it anyways, am I right?</p> <h2></h2>   <i></i>
