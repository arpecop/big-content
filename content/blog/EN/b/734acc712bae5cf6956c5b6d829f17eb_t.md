It makes you feel more good about yourself once you tend to give something back to the society in any form possible. As they say “give a man fish to eat and you feed him for a day teach a man how to fish and then you forever”.</p>     <h2>Have a lot of friends</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1256.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Socializing helps you stay active and full of life.

It is important because as they say “early to bed early to rise makes one healthy, wealthy and wise”. This is really true because our body needs rest and that even in its proper hours so that it can function accordingly! Those who go to bed late at night and wake up late feel lethargic and more tired throughout the day which also limits productivity. As Misao Okawa who was Japan’s oldest citizen said “eat and sleep and you will live a long time”.</p> <h2>Maintain hygiene</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1260.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Staying neat and clean can also increase those years for you since you feel fresh about yourself and feel good too.</p> <h2>Have a pet</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1261.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Owning a pet reduces your stress levels and keeps you happy as suggested by a study.

If you are a straightforward person you will be able to live for longer years since your mind is always clear. Being an introvert can prove to be dangerous for you since they never share anything with anyone. Also, you should try to be a positive person and keep all the negative feelings away from yourself so that you can live longer. You should laugh a lot, stop smoking, believe in yourself and you will be able to increase those age numbers miraculously for yourself. Laughing helps to prevent anxiety, stress and makes you forget depressing memories. You should be an optimistic person rather than someone who stays glued to the past and is not willing to move on. That will create negativity and send negative vibes in your body. Never be a person who regrets but rather be someone who goes with the flow!</p> <h2>Regular checkup</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1263.jpeg"/>Shutterstock     <p>It is important that you always get yourself medically checked so that any potential dangerous things would be easily identified and remedial actions can be taken on time!</p>   <i></i>
