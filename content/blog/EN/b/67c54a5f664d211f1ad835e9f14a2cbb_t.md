         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 3<p> </p> <p>Believe it or not, men are just as much a mystery to women as women are to men. Every man is looking for someone with whom he can ride the waves of life with, who will be there to stand through better or worse. Though these traits maybe different for everyone, there are a few things that all men get attracted to; while every man is different, there are certain things about a woman that will make any man stand up, take notice, and make him decide he wants to get to know you on a deeper level.</p> <h2>Is confident in her own skin</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1574.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>No matter what someone says, a girl needs to be confident in her skin. There is nothing in this world that can grab a man’s attention as fast as a strong, confident and secure woman. She does not have to be gorgeous, rich and famous, but have to live her life in a place of meaning and purpose. That purpose can be anything as long as it means something to her. A confident girl is the one who is not waiting for her prince charming to take her out of distress rather is her own savior. She wouldn’t sit around relying on someone to support her financially but would find her way out. And when her Mr. Perfect comes her way, she wouldn’t give up everything for him, but would look for a way to merge their lives without giving up on everything she has earned so far. She would know how to blend the two without losing herself.</p> <h2>Good Communication Skills</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1575.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>In general, men are not natural communicators. Therefore, they want a woman who speaks to them in a concise and straightforward manner when it comes to expressing her needs. They want to avoid navigating through a woman’s feelings in order to interpret what she’s saying. He likes it when she doesn’t just mumble about stuff but directly tells him what she wants and how he can best deliver it. His goal is to make her happy and when he has the information on how to accomplish that, he feels more confident that he can do it.</p> <h2>Feminine manicured feet and hands to massage</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1576.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Girls it’s high time you realize no man likes chipped nails or calloused feet. To some of the girls who find this absolutely ludicrous, it might seem like the least important thing to men but oh boy I can assure you it really does make men fall on your feet (pun intended?) No man can resist peeking at beautifully polished nails and feet as they are all secretly attracted to women that know how to groom themselves.</p> <p>Everyone can cake-up their face but only a few actually know how to take care of the details. Therefore, it is important for girls to pay attention towards these little nitty-gritties.</p> <h2>A sweet and warm voice that makes him melt</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1577.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>I’m pretty sure everyone’s granny has at least once (let’s be honest it was more than once) used to say that girls should always speak softly instead of yelling at the top of their lungs just to get people to hear them out. Being a girl has its own perks I tell you, one of them being, not having to yell to deliver her message. Being ambitious and assertive doesn’t mean that you have to shout across the room and cut people off to rub dominance on them. That is considered rather rude and eventually people might avoid interacting with you.</p> <h2>Girls who can rock tough and feminine at the same time.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1578.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Guys are seriously turned on by women who like having their lives sorted out and are assertive. It is true that men love to be “caretakers” and “planners” for our families, but they also love women who can plan that life with them. They like having a visionary by their side who can see beyond today. Determined women are more committed, simply due to the fact that failure isn’t a choice for them. There are no uncertainties about their futures because they understand what it takes to get there. Ultimately, a woman who is willing to push forward to be the best mother to her children or have a successful career is one who will strive for a successful relationship. When things get tough, she won’t be so easy to quit and walk away as aspiring people, in general, usually figure out how to make things work.</p> <h2>Is drama, manipulation, and pressure-free</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1579.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It’s not just about men, but no one would want emotional drama queens who use their feminine charms to manipulate them out of their time or money. Dealing with emotional outbursts, sneaky ways and pushiness does not go over well in the long run with a man. In this fast-moving society, no one has the time for drama-queens but everyone is looking for an emotionally stable woman who is both authentic in her words and actions. He is not looking for a spoiled little brat who isn’t even capable to handle the ups and downs of life; he is looking for a woman.</p>     <h2>A sharp sense of humor to make him laugh</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1580.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Sharing same sense of humor should be given way more importance than we think as looks and superficial appearances fade with time, but a sense of humor is forever. Every guy is head over heels for girls who play it cool and know how to give a joke and take it back. If he knows that you guys will be laughing your way to your wrinkly days, then he is more likely to catch his eye and be persuaded to make a long-term commitment to you.</p> <p>Furthermore, if your girl can make you forget about the pressure you’re facing at work, the struggles you’re having with your family, or the simple unhappiness that tends to strike on us sometimes, you’re likely to associate that person with good, positive feeling.</p> <h2>A carefree and easy going attitude to stand by him</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1581.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>When a guy considers being with someone for a long time he usually wants to make sure that the other individual is a positive and optimistic person that he can lean on. Someone who instantly bring a sense of calm and sunshine into his life and others. Guys tend to like being around girls with whom they don’t need to stress out about anything or pretend to be someone they’re not. Life can get tough sometimes, but when you have a side-kick who knows how to easily give you perspective and lift some of that pressure off your shoulders, that person becomes instantly invaluable. At time of crises, we need some grounded people by our side to be able to smooth things out when the going gets tough.</p> <h2>Being intellectually challenging</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1582.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>There is no denying that someone’s looks are what initially draws us to them but being intellectually challenging and having the ability to hold real discussions about meaningful topics, will always trump shallow beauty in the long run. Stimulating conversations make men go crazy. An intellectually challenging girl would think critically and engage our senses. Furthermore, they have this drive to be successful, which in itself, can be the biggest turn on there is.</p> <p>The decisions we face in life can often present us with uncertainty and having someone insightful by our side can help us make the right ones. This doesn’t require a degree from Harvard, or any degree for that matter, just intellect, reasoning and understanding.</p> <h2>The color red</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1583.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>We all know that red is the color traditionally associated with love, lust, sex and romance, but a study by Andrew Elliot and Daniela Niesta proposes that our interest in this color may actually have a biological basis. A scientific study reveals that the color red increases a woman’s sex appeal and also makes her seem more approachable and competent. So girls you know what color to fill your wardrobe with now!</p> <h2>Loves them for who they are and not for their money</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1584.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>In our society where greed and lust are above love and compassion, we all know what most girls are looking for in a guy. Obviously money is of some concern but it isn’t above genuinely loving your partner.</p> <p>No matter how strong these men look on the outside, but on the inside all they demand is constant attention from their significant another. He would want her to think that he is the greatest and respect him for who he is and not what he does or how much money he makes.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1585.jpeg"/>Shutterstock     <p>In the end what matters the most is that whether or not you’re sincere to yourself. A girl who is sincere and committed to herself would know what she is doing and has very low probability of getting off-track. She would know what she wants and would not waste time on people that do not fit into that model. A person who himself is not clear about his goals and ambitions can never be sure about you.</p>   <i></i>
