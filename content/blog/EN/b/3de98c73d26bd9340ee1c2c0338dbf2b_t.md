          <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -14<p>Ancient Greece was a fascinating ancient civilization that lasted through the Archaic period to the end of the antiquity era. This makes it one of the oldest civilizations recorded, with a massive span from 12th century BC to 600 AD.</p> <p>Greek culture had a massive impact on how the world is today. Greek culture was carried forth into the world via the Roman Empire, which introduced it to the Mediterranean Basin after which Greek culture found its way into Europe. Remnants of Greek culture can be seen even today in modern art, philosophy, and politics. It is for this reason that classical Greece is considered to be the building block of Western culture and civilization.</p> <p>The Ancient Greeks played several roles. They were philosophers and the fathers of democratic rule; a civilized people lost in the pursuit of the truth and nothing else. While all of this holds, true, Greek culture also had some truly bizarre things about it.

In this ritual, a bull was made entirely of the metal bronze. The bull was hollow and had a door in one of its sides. While the purpose of the invention of this torture device was truly horrific, the methods used were quite ingenious. The life-sized bull had an acoustic apparatus that could convert the screams of its victims into the sound of a bull.</p> <p>The punishment worked as follows: The condemned were locked away inside this torture chamber and a fire was lit underneath the bull. Because it was made of metal, the bull would rise to staggeringly high temperatures, meaning that the person inside roasted to death.

The famous Greek physician, Soranus, was of the school of thought that if a woman got pregnant, it was her own fault. After all, it was not like the man involved could do anything to prevent the situation, right? Soranus suggested that instead of contraceptives, women should just squat and sneeze after copulation, followed by a good old rinse.</p> <p>Obviously, it did not work out that way, so Soranus had to come up with another strategy. He suggested that women rub honey or cedar resin on their genitals before engaging in sexual activity. The only reason that would work is that no one would engage if the situation were that disturbing!</p> <h2>Valid grounds for divorce</h2> <p>Pixabay</p> <p>The life-threatening disease of leprosy was contained within Greece, in the leper colony of Spinalonga, which was a tiny island near Crete.

Considered to be superior on account of their strength, the strength they produced during competitions was said to have healing powers.</p>     <p>Slaves loitered around gymnasiums, watching the athletes exhibit their athletic prowess. Once the events would come to a close, the slaves would rush to scrape the sweat right off of the athlete’s body. This sweat oily concoction was then dubbed “gloios.” This gloios was then bottled and sold as an ointment to those who were not as strong as the superior athletes were. It was said to calm and relieve aches and pains when rubbed over the torso or limbs.</p>   <i></i>
