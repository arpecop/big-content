         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 1<p>Just because of being more emotionally expressive, women are often considered the weaker of the sexes. With comments going so far as to say women just can’t control their emotions at all, a plethora of remarks and innuendos on the daily are hurled towards women on the daily. Not just by men but other women as well, shockingly. The facts of the matter, however, paint a different picture. Women throughout history have been known to be powerful, resilient, caring and nurturing beings who have outdone men in many an event if not for contesting right at their side. Are you ready to take charge of your mental and emotional weaknesses? Read on!</p> <h2>#1: Know your enemy</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2205-1-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The first step as with any other self-growth chance is to know exactly where you lack and what causes this. Know what triggers your breakdowns and why you can’t take charge of them. Instead of grieving over what you can’t-do, take it as a learning example or stepping stone if you will, and try to understand where exactly something goes wrong for you. To grow as a competitive and dominating individual, you master the self. For this, invest some time and identify the issues at their core!</p> <h2>#2: Sticks and stones</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2205-2-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Don’t you ever let stereotypes break your spirit! As we’ve mentioned earlier, women have often been considered the lesser of the sexes simply for voicing their opinions. This is untrue. You know it – we know it. You need to rise above the hate and get a grip with the fact that those who look down at you simply don’t know any better. Stereotypes are merely labels and should always be taken with more than just a pinch of salt. On the flipside, women are actually more in touch with their emotions and are hence more likely to develop as humans, and master the self. This gives them an edge over men and even other women who try to hide their true feelings and act tough. Drop the act, people! Self-knowledge is the name of the game and it’s a total makeover for you psychologically as well as emotionally!</p> <h2>#3: See-saw of the mind</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2205-3-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>To achieve emotional and mental strength, you need to learn to balance positive and negative thoughts. Whereas it can be argued that positive thinkers are winners and if you believe in the positive, you will subconsciously work for it and not stop until it is achieved, this hangs on a balance. Negative thoughts have a bad rap for bringing us down when we really don’t need it at all, but there is a method to the madness. Negative thinking is necessary for anticipating – not hoping, what could possibly go wrong and always have a fallback plan. This is important from a realistic point of view because simply vesting all your powers into one scheme is never a good idea; nor is relying on the occurrence of a positive event. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket – balance!</p> <h2>#4: A drop and another make an ocean</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2205-4-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Have you ever seen a lighthouse that stands amidst crashing waves and gusts of wind strong enough to blow you away? (Pun intended). Well, consider how it was made. Brick by brick. That’s what you need to learn too if you want to be mentally unshakeable. Mentally strong people have been through tough times and have taken a beating every now and then. Taking each experience as a learning one and making the most of it, mentally tough people all have this one thing in common. They keep their eyes on the goal but they map out the route to it in small pieces. This is exactly what you need to do if you’ve already established what your goal is – plan out the route to it! Make smaller, more realistic and more practical steps and you will be at your goal in no time. Guaranteed!</p> <h2>#5: Impossible is nothing</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2205-5-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>You need to realize that there is no such thing as being over-ambitious. Anne Frank, Harper Lee, Mother Teresa, Florence Nightingale, Benazir Bhutto and many other ladies have more than just their gender in common with you – they were also individuals. Much like yourself. Understand that if someone gives you the typical “You’re too weak to do this” speech, this isn’t discouragement. This is in actual essence, motivation. Go after it and make sure you prove them wrong.</p>     <h2>#6: Love and war</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2205-6-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Know that friendships and relationship can and sometimes will, hurt. In such situations, don’t think the world is coming crashing down at your feet. Don’t try to hold back your tears just because it’s the ‘weak’ thing to do. It never is. Know to face facts and understand that expressing your emotions is completely alright. Just know you have to rise above any and every form of hate. Power through!</p> <h2>#7: Don’t be afraid to reach out</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2205-7-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Know when to give up – it’s perfectly natural to do so. They say sometimes holding on hurts much worse than letting go. Learn to know when it is time. Identify people and occurrences that suck out the happiness from whatever it is you’re up to. Be it a project, a friend or someone you fancy. If it’s doing you more harm than good, let it go!</p> <h2>#8: You’re worth it</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2205-8-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Be kind to yourself. Take time with your craft and don’t take the weight of the world on your shoulders. Just to prove someone wrong, don’t go to great lengths. It is often not worth it. Never mind what others expect from you and keep trucking on at your own pace. Being kind to yourself will reverse all exhaustion from your mind and help you achieve a more stable and positive state of mind. Not to mention high levels of stress can actually increase the aging process. Unless you’re into wrinkles, don’t beat yourself up!</p> <h2>#9: Those who mind don’t matter</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2205-9-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Don’t take things too personally, Much of what happens in life is usually nothing affecting you as a person, but it’s just that taking anything to the heart is like an ingrained habit. Learn to work your way around that and you’ll see yourself grow without the weight of self-consciousness on your shoulders</p> <h2>#10: Ask for help</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2205-10-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Never be afraid to reach out and ask for some help. Being strong doesn’t mean you’ll become self-subsistent and never have to rely on anyone else for help. Being strong actually, means you’ll know when to ask for help because it’ll be for your own development. Acknowledge your gut when it asks you to reach out and knows there is always that one person or that one group of people who will help you. Your parents, your significant other, a colleague or even an online personality. Know when you need it!</p> <h2>#11: Stand for what you believe in!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2205-12-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Don’t just need something Want it. As a famous saying goes – when you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe, that’s when you’ll take your first step. Don’t just need that pay raise or that new pair of shoes or even something as conceptual as equal recognition at the presentation at work. Want it. Work for it. Know that whatever it is that anyone else needs on this planet, you want. And you’re going to get it!</p> <h2>#12: Refuse to be silenced</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2205-11-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Express your emotions and thoughts and don’t care about those who say you shouldn’t. Most people think women are just overly emotional creatures who don’t have a control over their doings, but as we’ve established, this is literally the opposite of the truth. Don’t let anyone bully you into silence and don’t ever accept anyone’s definition of you!</p>     <p>It’s time to show the world that there is much to being a woman than being a damsel in distress or the default victim. It’s time you take a stand through your actions and never take no for an answer. Stand strong and tall, and let the world see you’re destined for greater things!</p>   <i></i>
