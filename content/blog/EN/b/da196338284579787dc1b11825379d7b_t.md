They hold deep secrets, eons of knowledge hidden in their fiery, starry powers and that these stars definitely have a huge hand at play when it comes to what goes on here, on earth. Just like a full moon drives something as strong as an ocean wild, how can we assume that all of these billions of other stars serve no purpose?</p> <p>Some of us with firm belief in stars and their magic are always looking into the zodiac knowledge for our own star and everything that we need to know about it. We read about how the day and the week would be like for us, which star sign we can be best friends with and which one is bound to betray us sooner or later. Similarly, when it comes to love, we turn to the stars once more: who will be the love of our life and what the stars have to say about it?</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-867.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>If you are wondering that, wonder no more. We have all the answers, right here right now. Each zodiac sign is ruled by one of the four elements: fire, water, earth, air. It isn’t always necessary that those who share the same element make the best couple too. Nature works on a delicate balance. Scroll through the pairings below and find out which star sign is the most compatible with yours.</p> <h2>12. Aries and Aquarius</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-868.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>These zodiac signs with their elements of fire and air will find that there is never a dull moment between them.

While you may not see them spending one too many evenings at home, you will find them taking up new adventures more often.

Here is a couple who will never tire of one another and will always relish the perfect partner they have found in each other.</p> <h2>11. Taurus and Cancer</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-869.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Taurus (Earth) with its defining traits of trustworthiness, stability, loyalty and humanity complements Cancer (Water) who is very emotional and sensitive. Cancer can be one of the most complex zodiac signs to get to know on a personal basis.

These two stars work as well together as the parts of a well-oiled machine. Cancer and Taurus are capable of forming an emotional connection as deep as their physical one.

Gemini and Aquarius</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-870.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>They share the same element (Air) and are extremely in-tune with each other. Expressive and quick-witted Gemini is the most suitable companion for the just, curious, affectionate and imaginative Aquarius.

This is the kind of relationship where both the partners have each other’s back at all times. They take the good with the bad and are all the more glad for it.</p> <h2>9.

The generous, compassionate and extremely faithful and caring Pisces has found the perfect match in a deeply intuitive and sentimental Cancer.

Pisces is all about making a deeper, soul-reaching connection and Cancer with their crazy commitment qualities can appreciate and nurture that connection like no other can. They have a fine harmony between themselves. These are like two strong and tall pillars that stand confidently on their own in the relationship but contribute equally towards keeping it resilient. Like the old saying goes, they love themselves enough to be able to love the other one more.</p>     <h2>8. Leo &amp; Sagittarius</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-872.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Passions run high and never dry between these two as they both share the same element, fire and fire.

Thoughtful, attentive to detail and a deep sensitivity towards humanity Virgo is the most careful and caring of all star signs and works in harmony with the reliable, ambitious and practical Taurus.

Think of these as yin and yang; completely different yet they fit together perfectly. Their relationship is a smooth one as they rarely take frustrations out on each other.

This is the kind of couple who would go bar hopping one night of the weekend and be up and ready early the next morning to try out brunch at this new café downtown. They will never spend summers without making the most of them. If they had a map up on their home wall of all the places that they have been to together, you’d see more thumbtacks on it than paper.</p> <h2>3. Capricorn &amp; Taurus</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-877.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Both these Earthy signs have what we hear about so much in movies and read in books: soul mates.

They don’t have to work hard at their relationship because it just comes naturally to them. They are drawn to each other, as if it’s written in the stars (and it is).

Aquarius &amp; Gemini</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-878.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>When it comes to intimacy, these Air-y stars two could probably have sex by verbal stimulation. The intellectual aspect of their relationship is always fun to witness for others as they would indulge in deep arguments and forget that anyone else is even present. They challenge each other’s minds like no one else. They might not always share the same belief systems but allow each other the independence and freedom to enjoy their own rationale. Trust is an important and strange thing for them; while Aquarius abhors lying Gemini will have enough freedom from Aquarius to not lie about anything at all.</p> <h2>1. Pisces and Scorpio</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-879.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com     <p>While Scorpio is suspicious and controlling by nature, Pisces waters those tendencies down because of its idealistic approach towards love and passion. If a Scorpio partner is open to communication and the Pisces partner reciprocates with needed boundaries, the relationship can be exciting and nothing short of magical. Together they will explore insights into their emotional possibilities and will rely on each other’s judgment to create intimacy.</p>   <i></i>
