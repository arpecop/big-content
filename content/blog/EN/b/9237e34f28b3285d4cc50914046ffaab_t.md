         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -4<p> </p> <p>That’s right: contrary to popular belief, women aren’t the complicated, fascinating yet frustrating beings that most guys think they are. If you’re under the impression that they cannot be understood or reasoned with, then, <em>boy</em>, are you wrong!</p> <p>Sure, women aren’t exactly simple things either. Nor do they sometimes say what they mean. When a girl says “I’m fine”, she generally is not fine. But that’s only because women are brought up in a society that forces females to play the stereotypical nice and polite damsel. The more you understand where she comes from and how she truly feels, the closer you are to actually getting the girl. So, take notes, boys. This is going to be an educational ride.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2408.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Women put a lot of themselves in their relationships. Whether it be friends, family, work or a romantic interest, they give it their all. So, when they sacrifice so much of their time and space for others, naturally they begin to expect that the other person will reciprocate and do the same for them. Women just want to be feel cherished and appreciated, from time to time. The last thing you want to do is prioritize your work or friends over them.</p> <p>When you’re dating a girl, make sure you take out some of your time to truly remind her of how much you care about her. It doesn’t have to be something lavish either – sometimes even a simple, unexpected text from you could change her day for the better! If you’re just beginning to know her, you can ask her out for a date and plan out a nice, romantic evening. Reserve a table at her favourite restaurant, dress well and show up on time. While these may seem like obvious things to do, you would be surprised at how girls notice the little things you do for them and appreciate them.</p> <p>Modern dating has led to guys asking girls to ‘hangout’ rather than ‘go out’. The hangouts are usually super casual and may involve a group of friends, not just you two. Girls prefer intimacy but they agree to hanging out nonetheless because they have no other option. So, don’t be afraid to go old-school and ask her out on a date. It’s a classic way of letting her know you’re interested and you’re willing to sacrifice your time for her.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2409.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Another myth dissolved! The notion that girls are only attracted to the bad boys is wrong. While being the good guy may not have worked in your favour when you were younger, it might be comforting for you to know that women actually seek the nice guys as they get older. Studies in the UK have observed that, overall, women preferred kind and virtuous men regardless of their looks over men who were physically attractive but had rotten personalities.</p> <p>Kindness is indeed a virtue and simply adds to your attractiveness, rather than diminishing it. If the woman you are dating is a little older, another reason might be that she has already dated plenty of bad boys before realizing that she cannot change them for the better. Kindness and courtesy make you appear as ideal husband material. Thus, women prefer the nice guys for long-term relationships because they receive the impression that they will always be treated like the princess they are. If you’re a nice guy and are worried about your dating life, don’t. Stay true to who you are and ‘the one’ will appear eventually.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2410.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>No, we aren’t contradicting what we just said. There’s a huge difference in being a nice guy and saying you’re a nice guy, and girls know it. Years of experience in meeting ‘nice guys’ over the internet that transform into rude, potty-mouthed monsters the moment they are denied the attention they seek or are rejected have prepared every female to immediately the identify the genuinely good guys out of the flock.</p> <p>Rule number one: do not expect her to repay you in some way for being nice to her. Some men have not realized that simply being sweet to her for the moment isn’t going to help them get into her good books. Nor does she have to do what you want in exchange for being treated well. She doesn’t owe you anything. You should be a good person and do good deeds for the sake of being a good person, not because you want to be rewarded later on. That’s not how it works.</p> <p>Rule number two: do not blame women for not wanting to date you. Men who believe they deserve to be noticed by the opposite sex because they are ‘nice’ are actually very, very bitter. They don’t hesitate in holding the girl responsible for the lack of attention they receive and are likely to treat their better half very badly. Rather, they should be looking internally at what the real problem is – themselves.</p> <p>The truly nice ones do not tell others that they are nice but prove it with their actions. Girls notice how guys treat the people around them and even complete strangers. You don’t need to brag about how good you are to people around you, just do it without expecting anything in return. You might be pleasantly surprised at what you <em>do</em> get.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2411.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Ah, catcalling. The universal problem that plagues women of all shapes and sizes in the world. Imagine walking down the street after a long, tiring day at work. You just want to get home, take a bath and collapse on your bed. You’re mentally and physically spent. And a complete stranger from across the street shouts at you, “You’d look a lot prettier if you smiled, honey!” How would you feel? Flattered? Happy? Grateful? No, rather the opposite. There is a general opinion in the masculine population that women should always be smiling and appear inviting, no matter what. But when they resort to catcalling random women on the street, they only incite feelings of hostility and fear.</p> <p>You see, when a woman is forced to wear a smile on her face 24/7, she ceases to become a person. She becomes a decoration. There is nothing more insulting to a girl than devaluing her to mere eye candy. We should encourage women to express themselves more openly, just like men do. There should be no pressure on them to act prim and proper and repress their emotions. These bottled up sentiments only explode later on and cause a big mess. So, boys, try to be understanding and let your girl be in a bad mood when she wants do. Better letting it out than keeping it in.</p> <p>Luckily, the younger generation seems to be more aware about this. In fact, generally most of the catcallers consist of older men. Here’s to hoping the times change for the better.</p>     <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2412.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Remember how we said girls notice how you treat the people around you? Well, your mom is also included in this. Most women are taught that the way to truly know a man is to observe how he treats his mom. This does not apply to men with abusive mothers, of course. Girls are immediately attracted to guys who talk about and treat their mothers with respect, love and compassion. Why is this so? Well, first of all, it shows that you truly appreciate the woman who gave birth to you and brought you up. Second, it reflects how you could potentially treat your other half. It shows that you respect the women in your life and that you have a warm, loving heart. And believe us, there’s nothing more attractive than that.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2413.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>If you’ve messed around in the past or our currently seeing other people, be honest to her about it. We get it – most guys are afraid of commitment and don’t want to get tied to just one person, too soon. Most girls happen to think that way too. It’s not farfetched to assume that the girl you’re seeing might have other men at her disposal, especially if you’re in the early stages of the relationship. So, when she pops the question about commitment, only say ‘yes’ when you truly mean it.</p> <p>If you’re worried that she won’t take the news that you’re seeing other people well, then you’re probably wrong. In this age of social media, it’s very easy to get in touch with other people. So, it makes sense that you’re keeping your options open. Also, if you’ve never had the ‘exclusive talk’ before, then there will be no reason for her to get upset. If she feels hurt or betrayed, then it will be on her because she set expectations on you without mutual consent. You can avoid a lot of misunderstandings if you’re just honest about how you feel and what you want to do.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2414.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Ghosting is the act of suddenly disappearing from someone’s life suddenly and without warning, after everything seemed to have being going well. In some situations, this could be seen as acceptable behaviour: you felt threatened or unsafe with your partner. Or you were betrayed or treated in an unforgivable manner. When neither of this is so, ghosting is an unfortunate incident and it has been observed that girls are affected more by it than boys. In fact, boys tend to ghost girls more. Why? Men seem to find it convenient to date a girl for a little while, get what they want from her and then just leave like that. After a few months, they return when the girl hasn’t quite gotten over them yet and repeat the cycle. It’s a poisonous habit that can be avoided with, yet again, honesty. Be honest when you are upset about something and communicate. Chances are you can work it out rather than abandon the relationship altogether and hurt each other.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2415.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>It’s true. Studies have shown that women get over breakups faster than men. It’s because they tend to feel emotions in real-time, so they are in grief immediately after the relationship is over. On the contrary, men tend to feel the shockwaves of grief much later on. By the time they regret their decision and want to get back together, their ex has probably moved on. So, what do you do? Think real hard and long if you want to break up. Is it a small or big issue? Is it worth completely severing your relationship and then facing the backlash of seeing your ex be happy with someone who isn’t you? Breakups are not easy things, kids, so be careful.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2416.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Nowadays, most men think feminists are a joke. Women who call out sexism, at home and in the workplace, are seen as annoying, illogical and wimpy. What they need to understand is associating certain negative traits to a certain sex is sexism itself. It is a very real issue faced by women everywhere. When your girl tells you that something you said or did was sexist, you’d better listen. They are not attacking you for the fun of it, they are very seriously pointing out something that was hurtful to them. After all, how do you expect to change your bad behaviour without someone correcting it?</p> <p>You might have complimented a woman by saying, “You’re too pretty to go to this school” and thought it was a smooth line. But what she hears is, “You have the looks, but not the brains”! In another situation, you say, “How are you still single?” in order to emphasize how irresistible she is. What you’re actually doing is pouring salt on her wounds – her singleness may have been a sensitive topic. There are too many women who scroll through their Facebook every day, seeing their female counterparts happily married and having babies. So, you can see why careless pickup lines are a major turnoff. However, if you’ve ever said or did something that was sexist, do not fret. Men who admit their mistakes and change for the better are highly appreciated by women.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2417.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>A major point to be noted is that women want their relationship to be slow and steady. I know, ironic right, considering that 62% of the time it is the woman who wants to rush things along. So, occasionally, they need their man to step in and press the brakes. To slow things down but not to the extent that they feel that he is losing interest in her. You see, relationships start with laying down one brick at a time. It takes time and effort to build a strong foundation for your relationship to stand on. You need to get to know each other fully and experience a lot of hardships together to remain strong and steady.</p> <p>If you skip these important primary steps and head straight for the physical part, it is a recipe for disaster. The relationship will be short, shallow and unfulfilling. To ensure that this doesn’t happen, slow things down a little to a simmer. Take your time to make her feel special so that when the moment comes that you two want to commit to a physical relationship, it feels special for both of you. Never, ever pressure or blackmail your partner to do something that they don’t want to do. That is a no-no.</p>     <p>Hugs, kisses and cuddles are appreciated, not just in the beginning of the relationship but all the time! Keep all of these things in mind and go get her, tiger.</p>   <i></i>
