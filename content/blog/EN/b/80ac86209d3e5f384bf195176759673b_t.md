Maybe that is one of the reasons why it is commonly said that men are from Mars and women are from Venus. There is a huge difference between both reaching that climax which is the highest point of sexual gratification.</p> <p>For women it is often very elusive and achieving it is like hunting for a mythical sensation which is just never converted into a reality. This is the reason why we are taking the help of science to aid you in your quest to achieving that fulfilling and satisfying moment of the sexual realm.</p> <p>Of course the way you and your partner make love to each other and the way you explore different options between the sheets matter but there are other factors as well. The following dynamics if incorporated between you and your partner will increase the likelihood of achieving that orgasm.</p> <h2>1. Communication between you and your partner</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1838.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>We are not about the dirty talk between you both but actually other things which make for a more open and direct communication. The more clearly you both could explain yourself to each other will mean more better understanding of each other’s body and specific preferences. For this both of you need to be very direct without any inhibitions or creeping shyness because otherwise you might not understand and correspondingly fulfill your partner’s needs.</p> <p>Infact saying the three magical words “I love you” during sex will make the journey more beautiful as published in this report. There is a higher chance of reaching that wonderful land of euphoric bliss out of sex. Most people don’t recommend communication during sex but it actually helps a lot in connecting at a deeper level with your partner.</p> <h2>2. Self-esteem between the sheets</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1839.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The more comfortable you are with your body image and your sexual performance and output the higher is the chance of achieving orgasm. More often than not women only feel it is their partner’s job to help make them cross the finish line while in reality they themselves are holding back due to self-doubt and second guessing their abilities. According to this study body image and self-esteem is one of the key determinants to female sexual orgasm.</p>     <p>Just grab a sexy lingerie or even sweatshirt that makes you look attractive and whole heartedly believe in your beauty and body image. Don’t let the inner voice tell you negatively in fact try to positively reinforce your body image in your mind. It will be much easier for you to just enjoy your sex life and ultimately being satisfied.</p> <h2>3. How strong and trusting relationship you have with your partner</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1840.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Your relationship status does play an instrumental role in you being able to get a fulfilling sex leading to that mind blowing orgasm. If you are unhappy with your partner or there is little or no attempt to make things more exciting or interesting will directly impact your sex life. It does take the proverbial two to make things work out and a successful relationship with your partner is one of those factors needed to be taken into account.</p> <h2>4. To be in the moment and fully appreciate lovemaking</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1841.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Most of us engage in sexual activity but our minds are wandering everywhere. There is no focus on the things at hand and consequently we don’t fully enjoy the experience. According to the 2016 study, those women who leave their work and other distractions outside the bedroom door are more likely to experience orgasm. It is about training your mind to be in the zone and connecting with your partner at a much deeper level and completely let go of any inhibitions or discomforts.</p> <p>This will take some time but it will be worth it once you will start enjoying and appreciating those intimate moments more clearly.</p> <h2>5. Anatomical limitations</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1842.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The above are all such factors which you could consciously control. However according to a research if the distance between your urinary opening and the clitoris is two centimeters stack the probability of orgasm in your favor. If that distance is almost three centimeter makes orgasm a little less likely.</p>     <p>However this anatomical disadvantage could easily be overcome with a little stimulation which will make them forget all about measurements and just enjoy the act.</p>   <i></i>
