It is mostly about how you will fare through the week or about attributes that are praise-worthy and make you endearing to others. Seldom do we come across zodiac signs spelling out your darkest fantasies and disturbing tendencies which also scarily are accurate to a large extent. You may not be aware of such predispositions or even consciously register the fact that you are even capable of such deeds. Your zodiac sign will aid you to pick up those subconscious behaviors which may be residing in the darkest crevice of your brain. Never before revealed or even if it did it was very subtle but definitely there in our mind and heart.</p> <p>If you always associate yourself with cheery, happy-go-lucky personality it is time to face the mirror and watch your dark side be revealed according to your birth month.</p> <h2>12. Aries</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-119.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You are always fantasizing about death and murder. You find certain sadistic pleasure in imagining about someone’s murder and yet you may be speaking to the very same person cordially. You are short-tempered and this is to be expected since you are one of the fire-signs which mean you are energetic and enthusiastic but equally destructive. You have the potential to wreak havoc should someone cross your path and only a spark is needed to start the fire. This may also be explained by your highly dominant behavior. You might be very egoistic and if you feel the other is coming off as imposing will flare up the inner ram in you. You are also very impatient and have little to no tolerance when it comes to waiting. Your fiery tempers are to be blamed since you tend to make rash decisions without deliberating much over the matter.</p> <h2>11. Taurus</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-120.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Another sign with horns and they too are strong headed like Aries when it comes to being stubborn. You will not at all give in to other’s opinion until and unless what you say is accepted. You have the determination required to stick with your guns in any argument. One would do well not to push around a Taurus person or they will nail you by their horns! You would disregard other people’s emotions as you believe you have complete grasp over the situation at hand. This arrogance makes you appear cold to others. You will not give a slightest thought to the consequences of your action even if it involved harming others to achieve your own goals. You are always devising ways to get out of a hard work as you are lazy and will not stop at any length to make others do it for you.</p> <h2>10. Gemini</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-121.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Your dual nature is apparent in every action. Your cheerful exterior actually houses a monster within which may be unleashed on the slightest of pretexts. The problem is your confusion that is always there in your mind and heart which makes you agitated to your core. You cannot decide whether you love a thing or hate it. Your mood swings are totally unpredictable and make you highly susceptible to spontaneous decisions which may even surprise you. This duality of course makes you good liars and manipulators and you find it very easy to twist other people’s opinion about a situation according to your version. This lying and deceit naturally makes you superficial and you may appear to be one person but entirely different on the inside.</p> <h2>9. Cancer</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-122.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Having the ruling planet as Moon if you are a Cancer person you will know you are extremely moody. Your mood depends on the people and places around you. You may be feeling down in the dumps one second and change of scenery and you are the most cheerful person in the room. You may have a soft core but one should be aware of the pincers which come out if one is not being careful. Since changing moods and over the top sensitivity makes you highly unpredictable. You do not believe in forgive and forget, you will commit the person who wronged you to your memory and when the time is right you will strike them down.</p> <h2>8. Leo</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-123.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Another fire sign who are well known for their fiery tempers and dominating nature. You cannot stand the fact that someone else might be in charge of the situation. You will bully and beat the competition into submission or else eliminate them because your thirst for limelight is greater than hurt of others. It will not bother you to climb over others to reach your goal without even feeling slightest of remorse. Your extreme pride will get in your way of forgiving others and will make you hold sustaining grudge against others. Ruled by the planet Sun, you are highly impatient if others are not conforming to your ideas. Woe betide them if they ever criticize you as you will come at them with bare fangs and claws since you are a sight to behold in your legendary anger.</p>     <h2>7. Virgo</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-124.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You are a perfectionist in a complete sense of the word. You have exceptionally high standards which you come to expect from everyone. Interestingly you are also over criticizing of your own self and hold yourself to those high standards as well. You are not impressed easy and you will not acknowledge others even if they tried because you derive a certain sense of pleasure from seeing others try and fail. You cannot tone down your criticism and often times you appear brutally harsh and if you can help it preacher of doom and gloom. As you are a pessimist and skeptical of every outcome you try to make others feel that way too.</p> <h2>6. Libra</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-125.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You are the silvered tongued devils who can easily get into someone’s good books or manipulate others to their own advantage. You have this charming wit and convincing manner that will make you come off as a genuine person but you will be actually pushing for some ulterior agenda of your own. You are full of contradictions as you have unpredictable personalities or at least seemingly unpredictable. You secretly thrive in chaos and push for a full scale riot when things could be done in a peaceful manner.</p> <h2>5. Scorpio</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-126.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You have a vengeful nature and will sustain the grudge for a long time. They have memories like elephants when it comes to remembering someone who betrayed them or wronged them. One simply does not mess with a Scorpio person and forget about the matter completely. If you are a Scorpio person you will look for the perfect opportunity to get back at them even if the other person has completely forgotten about the matter. It is in your nature to retaliate and it is apparent in your habit of being too argumentative. To expect a Scorpio to submit to your point of view is foolishness to say the least.</p> <h2>4. Sagittarius</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-127.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You have an uncanny ability to find other person’s weakness and make them suffer by highlighting it to them.

Capricorn</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-128.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You feel like you are carrying the whole world on your shoulders. You will get affected by the pain of others as though you yourself are subjected to that torture. Your over the top empathy is something that consumes you and drives you into depression. Your so called friends can not relate with you at all because they do not understand your pain as you do. The worst thing is you can not specify why you feel all the bad things happening in the world to be affecting you.</p> <h2>2. Aquarius</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-129.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You are self-indulgent individual who may only be concerned about their welfare even if it may come at the cost of their loved ones. Being an Air sign you cannot help but appear aloof and distant from others. No one is allowed to get you’re your heart as you prefer your solitude. You are one of the rare zodiacs who might get into a significant relationship without becoming too involved emotionally. You have your own ideals and way of doing things and you expect others to leave you to your own devices rather than interfere.</p> <h2>1. Pisces</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-130.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com     <p>There is always that mischievous smile on your face which gives away your scheming mind which is squirming like a toad, looking for trouble.
