There might have been a moment where you got frustrated enough to run after him or not notice that he is not interested in you at all.</p> <p>There might have been a moment where you convinced yourself he must like you just really deep down and is too shy to express it. These are those moments in your life where you need to tell yourself that the next step you are going to take to get his attention is wrong and you are going to end up embarrassing yourself.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1513.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>So here are several reasons why you should never chase a man:</p> <h2>12. Making yourself go insane:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1514.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>Have you ever wondered what good it would do to you running after a guy who is not interested in you at all? Or even if he is you are going to ruin it just by chasing him around like a dog without a leash. Let’s face it everyone runs from those. Not are you playing games with your own heart and mind but you are blaming him for doing it.</p> <p>Not only are you blaming him for doing it you are blaming an innocent person for doing something he really isn’t. Living every moment like you just got broken up with is probably not the best for your brain. In this whole process it is possible that you are driving yourself completely insane.</p> <h2>11. Exhausting yourself:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1515.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>You are constantly going to second guess all your actions where he is concerned. Not only are you going to keep asking yourself if you were stupid for liking his profile picture on face book and instagram in the same hour but you are going to spam text your best friend looking for a confirmation of your stupidity as well. Living in this constant state of anxiety is not going to do anyone good. Not to mention it is going to divert your attention from things that actually matter, like your job?</p> <h2>10. Offering your soul to someone who is just going to cut it:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1516.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>Well metaphorically speaking, you offer this guy anything it is coming directly from your heart. His refusal can act as an either really blunt knife or his obliviousness can act as a very sharp one, feel free to shift the euphemisms around to whatever might hurt you more. Offer to bring him a glass of water and he refuses coldly, ouch. Offer to walk him to the door and he said no thanks, another ouch. The pain will not get any easier. Spare your heart the need for a pacemaker, those limit your life more than you think.</p> <h2>9. Running in circles:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1517.jpeg"/>.  <p>You know the perks of meeting the right person? You would not have to run after them. Why? Because you would not have to run after them. You would want what they want, which is basically wanting to be together.</p> <p>You go left, he goes left, he goes right, you go right, no matter what direction you take you would be on an equal level because well you both want each other. If he does not like you, well you go right, he goes left, you go left and he goes right.</p> <p>Eventually well you find yourself running in circles and getting dizzy because he has snooped out while you were contemplating his next move.</p> <h2>8. Your career goes down the rabbit hole:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1518.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>You might believe that running after a guy is really just a time pass, but you won’t notice the time passing by you, as you run after a person who does not deserve you. This could affect your career in two ways. One where your love obsession is your co-worker or boss in which case you’ll be too busy fawning over the man to even pay attention to your work in the first place. Possibly getting a sexual harassment complaint being filed against you at Human Resources.</p> <p>Another where the man of your dreams is so far away from your work that you stop going to work so you can coincidentally bump into him or find excuses to meet him. See how you are done in career wise in both instances?</p>     <h2>7. Your self-esteem takes a brutal beating:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1519.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>Are you really ready to trade in your dignity for a pair of running shoes to chase after a man who is not going to do anything but shred whatever semblance of your ‘self’ you have left by constantly rejecting you? Or completely annihilate you by being mean about the rejection as well? Think about all the years you have worked to build up your self-esteem and the years you spent with the reasons why.</p> <h2>6. Missing out on all the great stuff:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1521.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>You might have a tendency to run past a great pair of roses to run after a pair of runaway weeds and you don’t even realize it. Same goes for men, and not just men but other relationships as well. Running after one bad weed will not only ruin you for yourself but for other relationships as well. You will always feel like you are not good enough just because of this one experience where you were not successful with a relationship.</p> <p>This does impact your other relationships and not in a good way. You will also miss all the positive input and vibes other and better people have to give you in favor of this one person you spend most of your life chasing.</p> <h2>5. Paranoia becomes your friend:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1523.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>Like we mentioned earlier, over analyzing your every move towards a guy you like will probably only help you get an anxiety disorder. The slightest behavior change or the social media post will make you become paranoid and you would not be able to rest till you know for sure if it is really about you or not.</p> <p>Eventually your behavior towards this one person will spread towards other people in your life which will make your paranoia even more over the top and potentially cost you your relationships as well.</p> <h2>4. Men were known as the knight in the shining armors:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1525.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>Bring chivalry back. Something you really need to get tattooed on your forehead or arm so you can see it and the person you shouldn’t be chasing can see it. Understand this, since it is men who are sitting upon the trusty steeds who are good for hunting or well chasing, they should be the ones chasing you not the other way around. In the Victorian age it was the men that wooed the women not the other way around.</p> <p>No this not something you need to start evoking feminism over but something you need to realize that men have become lazy because women chase them and keep taking the dates being offered to them on a platter for granted.</p> <h2>3. Do you really have him when you catch him?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1527.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>What happens when the chase finally ends and you do by some miracle end up getting the man of your dreams? Here are a few follow up questions concerning this: ‘Was he worth the emotional and mental trauma?’ ‘Was he exactly what you were looking for?’ ‘Do you think he really is yours now?’ ‘Does he deserve you?’ You need to realize that if he was really into you, you would never have had to chase him in the first place.</p> <p>You also need to realize that you might have him physically but mentally he might not be yours at all.</p> <h2>2. Dreams are dreams for a reason:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1529.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>Dreams usually stem from experiences and or your own desires. People might desire a cigarette but that in no way means it is good for them, they might desire alcohol but that is not good for them. You need to realize that the man you have to chase is someone you desire but not someone who is necessarily good for you. Some addictions prove to be fatal, this one might be yours.</p> <h2>1. Finding happiness in your own self:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1531.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>Women who chase after a man, chase them because they feel like their happiness is embedded in the idea of having that particular person. This reliance on other people and other obstacles might make you into a dependent person who really can’t find happiness within her own self.</p>     <p>No women in her right mind would trade in her dignity if she did not believe it would bring her eternal happiness and sometimes those instincts we have are wrong. Finding happiness in your own self is what you need to achieve satisfaction.</p>   <i></i>
