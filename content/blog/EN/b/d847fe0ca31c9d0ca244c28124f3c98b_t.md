To fill you in on what we are exactly talking about, clitoris is a small bud like hooded part of flesh on top of the vulva.</p> <p>However it packs the most punch in sexual gratification if properly handled. It may look insignificant but it has a very complex structure and is deeply connected with the vaginal canal and the pleasure women feel inside their vagina is actually clitoral pleasure.</p> <p>Clitoris is not that different from penis, according to U.S National Library of Medicine, referring to it as similar in nature with penis. It also gets erect when aroused just like penis and becomes hyper sensitive after orgasm. Infact when a fetus is developing a penis is initially a lot like a clitoris. Since there is so much written about this little organ of marvel, we decided to brush aside some popular myths associated with it.</p> <h2>5. The bigger the clit and more visible means more sensitive to touch</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-569.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It is not necessary that if you have a small hooded clitoris you will feel less stimulated upon touch as compared to a larger more visible one.</p> <p>One popular spa treatment recommends women with smaller hooded clitoris to undergo ‘dehooding treatment’ so their partner will not have to move the hood back to directly touch it.</p> <p>This is an absolute unnecessary treatment since even if the hood is not pulled back the stimulation will be the same and one will achieve an orgasm.</p> <p>Sensitivity is not at all dependent on size rather it is based on neurological set up of the clit and your body’s chemistry like hormonal levels. These factors don’t get affected by the size of clitoris. Hence many women with small clitoris may be very sensitive just like a large one.</p> <h2>4. Excessive use of vibrator will desensitize the clitoris</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-570.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>This is another myth which needs to be addressed. If after using a vibrator excessively, the clit feels numb does not mean it has been desensitized permanently.</p>     <p>Rather we can explain it with an example of you sitting on your hand for a long time. Since you are pressing on it your hand will become temporarily numb due to restricted blood flow. Similarly your clit will restore to its original state of sensitivity after some time.</p> <p>Another observation made by woman who may feel this way is due to the immediate orgasm they experience with vibrator which is not the case with other external stimulation like hand, mouth or penis.</p> <p>The stimulation with vibrator certainly makes one come quicker however it reduced the duration of external stimulation considerably. However if too much use is making you opt out of other methods of stimulation you should limit its use.</p> <h2>3. Much more than what meets the eye</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-571.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It may be overlooked as just another part of the body however it is in actuality a powerhouse for generating massive sexual pleasure. The nerve endings extend down both the legs and up in the body. This opens up many opportunities for different kinds of stimulations like playing with the inner clitoris, rubbing the pubic are up and down to make it aroused. This organ is hard to miss any stimulation applied to the vulva.</p> <h2>2. Clitoris has double the nerve endings than penis</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-572.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>There is a popular observation much highlighted by feminist that a clitoris has around 8000 nerve ending as compared to a penis with a measly 4000. However according to other sources both have around 7000 sensory nerve endings but since clitoris packs them in a much more concentrated manner it may be argued that clitoris is much more sensitive.</p> <p>According to sexologists penis and clitoris form from the exact same tissue but clitoris is more ‘denser’ neurologically speaking as compared to a penis. This doesn’t in no way mean that it is served by twice the nerve endings.</p> <h2>1. Clitoral stimulation is secondary option for orgasm</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-573.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It would come as a shock that only a quarter of a woman achieve their orgasm via intercourse alone. This shows how instrumental clitoral stimulation is while both the partners engage in love-making. It cannot be disregarded if one really wants to please their partner to the maximum.</p>     <p>The statistic is the work of not just one study but a collective of 33 studies spanning for over 80 years compiled by Elisabeth Lloyd in her book ‘The Case of the Female Orgasm’. This also explains why women not always achieve their orgasm while engaging in intercourse and is something quite often expected. The primary thing to remember is clitoral stimulation is very important for erotic pleasure.</p>   <i></i>
