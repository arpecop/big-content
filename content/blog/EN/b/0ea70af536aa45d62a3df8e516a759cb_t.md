Leap on to the chance to praise your belle</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1663.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>Pleasantries are never despised; in fact it is the sweetest smelling bait that can lure any living being. It just adds up the spices to calas when the living being is a ‘women’.

Hence, praise her every day, night. Concealing your thoughts would do nothing but run your relationship down. So without wasting a single juncture let your partner know how beautiful she is because it’s never too late!</p> <h2>9. Make her your priority</h2> <p>Without the shadow of doubt, life is same as an unsteady skyline: unpredictable and indisputable.

People indulge themselves into the trivial things overlooking the most auspicious blessing endowed to them. So it’s time to enlighten your mind and get the train back on track by sharing few moments of your life with one another.</p> <h2>8. Every day is a valentine day</h2> <p>Expressing your love once a year sounds unfair to me, isn’t it? Why do we need to have a discreet day to fess up? Why can’t we practice this every day? If blurting out the expressions prior to the wedding was no issue, than why is it now? The answer to these “why” leads us to the our solution of this maze.</p> <p>Make every day your Valentin’s day. Fill every moment with the wisps of love. Let each other know how much she/he means to you and be grateful to her/him for being there with you through the ups and downs. Now with the fingers intertwined into each other’s pledge to float through the time as a coherent unit. By practicing in your daily life will definitely strengthen your bond.</p> <h2>7. Mutual understanding is the essence of ecstatic life</h2> <p>One should always confide in its spouse. Confer every detail, be it personal or business, share your point of view and give importance to his/her suggestions. Negotiating a matter is the only way out. Evading it might delay, but exacerbates the consequences.

This develops an environment where both could assert anything with almost no hesitation and more comfortably.</p> <h2>6. Being truthful stoles every chance of rift</h2> <p>The thought of knowing your partner would never lie to you brings the sort of contentment one can barely think of. It reflects upon one’s loyalty: an aspect every single individual expects his partner to possess. Siding by the truth may be a tough job to come by, nevertheless leads towards ultimate felicity.</p>     <h2>5. Ever-dandy personality</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1664.jpeg"/>http://people.com <p>Up keeping oneself is one of the mandatory items. Couples after marriage tend to pay less attention to themselves or the daily rush could be blamed too, anyhow that’s not the point. Your spouse wants you be the same hotshot you used to be before marriage.They may not explicitly express their thought, but surely this untidiness gets under their skin. This really ain’t a biggie fellas!</p> <h2>4. Patience, sensibility may prove to be instrumental</h2> <p>Expressions demand actions. Which means verbally utterance of your love wouldn’t do unless you prove it. There are a million ways to prove that and the most effective one is to not let out your outrage. Getting incensed is all understandable and spontaneous; however, this is where sensibility comes to play. Sensibility is to refrain from an argument when exasperated allowing the tantrum to settle down because emotions lead to the dead end.</p> <p>This can be by moving out for a while or silence is another useful tool. When the water is under the bridge, you can set off the talks with apologies followed by a token of forgiveness restoring the friendly atmosphere.</p> <h2>3. Age shall never be hindrance</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1665.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>I believe age is just a number so if you believe until a certain age one can romance with its soul partner then am afraid you’re mistaken! Age shall never get between the two soul mates indeed it is meant to further strengthen your bond. Wrinkles may portray you ugly, shrieking voice may sound annoying, but the heart beating in your chest is be young enough to feel the same for your bae. One must always cherish every second that has passed and relish the time it has been bestowed with to adorn its present.</p> <h2>2. Festivity</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1666.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>Celebrating every tiny moment in your life would not only add up to the memories but would certainly bring you closer.

Or even indulging themselves in some sort of indoor games or so would do fine as well. The main concept is to laugh, have fun and obviously accompany each other more often.</p> <h2>1.
