One adorable grand mother however has bucked the trend of killing the excitement and joys of the little pleasures that life brings our way. Her reaction to a gift given to her by her family was priceless.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-69.jpeg"/>inspiremore.com <p>As her family members placed a gift in her lap <strong><em>“Oh, it’s heavy…” </em></strong>the ageing grand mother remarked.</p> <p>Just a few moments later as the lid was lifted from the box a black cat popped its head out and looked at its new surroundings in astonishment.</p> <p>After the initial jolt of the gift subsided the grandmother bent down and lovingly hugged the cuddly feline and gave out a cry of joy. The sight of the grandmother crying in joy was almost too much to handle!</p>     <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-70.jpeg"/>inspiremore.com <p>It just goes to show that we should never let life experiences kill the joy of the small things in life such as getting gifts for instance. In our rush for progress to climb the endless ladder of success and achievement we often ignore the small pleasures of life and become increasingly pessimistic as we age.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-71.jpeg"/>inspiremore.com <p>This grandmother has just shown us that this is not inevitable and that our happiness in reality depends on us how we react to things. What we have on the inside is just as important as external factors in determining our happiness.</p> <p>No matter what we have gone through or are going through we should never let the joy and excitement of life die inside us and should savour all the fun and happiness that we get be that from our own endeavours or the behaviour of others.</p> <p>Remaining happy is essential in order to avoid depression. Globally over half of all people who have committed suicide have done so while they suffered from depression. We often do not realise it but we slip into depression. Perfectionism and grandiose successes are required to make some people the inability to find pleasure in small things should ring alarm bells of depression.</p> <p>This can lead to suicide and in the United States on average 121 people kill themselves each and every day. The fight against depression does not have to be one of drugs and harmful anti depressants, rather we can all help ourselves by keeping a positive attitude and not letting the little joys be overlooked. We must find our own happiness and this is crucial for own well being.</p>     <p>We should also remain close to our aged loved ones. Old age is a lonely time and increasingly the old are being left alone to fend for themselves far from their children and loved ones.</p>   <i></i>
