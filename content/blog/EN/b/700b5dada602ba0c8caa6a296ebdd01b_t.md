         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -6<p>A lot of guys have a tendency to hide their actual feelings from the world and from the girls themselves, not saying that girls are any easier but since we are on the topic of guys at the moment let’s just start with that. Stuck in a rut with someone you like? Well if you are a female seeking the secrets of the male mind you have come to the right place.</p> <h2>He listens to you ramble constantly:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1874.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>We have all seen the memes about men complaining about their wives constantly talking, well here is a secret when a guy really likes you he actually listens to you talk! There are tell-tale gestures that let the other person know if the man in question is actually listening to you or not. Like when he tilts his head to the side or when he looks at you attentively, repeats whatever you say or even when he comments on all the right parts. You’ll know he was actually listening.</p> <h2>He can be called Mr. Nervous around you:</h2> <h2></h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1875.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Girls are not the only ones who get all bashful and shy around the guy they like, men can be like that as well. Being confident around a girl you like is just a myth for a reason. He might be a great macho man in front of his posse but if he is the exact opposite in front of you either you need to reevaluate your people person skills or if that is not the case then you know he definitely likes you!</p> <h2>He is ready to act like your girlfriend:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1876.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>There are a lot of things guys are ready to do to get into the good books of the girls they really want. One of these things are spending as much time with her as he can doing what she wants, the other thing showing him to be a more open minded person, something many women find attractive. Be it going out to shop for clothes or watch ‘The Notebook,’ if the guy really likes you he will not hold back from these activities to keep you happy.</p> <h2>His appearance change for the better:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1877.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Maybe the first time you guys met he did not make the best impression with his clothes or hygiene. You might have bumped in him at the office or college in a stained shirt, not very well ironed pants and greasy hair. Keeping in mind the first meeting the next time you bump into him he is impeccably dressed and smells like the manliest garden that could exist. Can we say he was dressed to impress? If so who was he dressed to impress?</p> <h2>He follows you on every social media account you guys have in common:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1878.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Social media is a great way to know people better, so don’t be surprised when the man who possibly wants you starts sending requests on every platform possible. The rumor about women stalking men on social media does not only apply to women. Men do it too.</p> <h2>The little physical gestures he makes:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1879.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Touching your lower back while guiding you to places, holding your hand palm out whilst he helps you cross the road, holding the door open for you, pushing a stray strand of your hair back behind your ear or any other opportunity to touch you and not in a salacious manner either shows he really likes you or that he is a really sweet and forward person. Take your pick.</p> <h2>The little verbal gestures he makes:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1880.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>He calls just to say hello and ask you about your day, he compliments you in a polite and sweet way, he tells you he understands you, he responds to your conversation in more ways than just grunting out a reply. These things are only likely to happen if the guy really likes you.</p> <h2>He texts you late at night:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1881.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>No one just randomly likes texting you to ask how your day was at 4 in the morning for nothing. He was clearly thinking about you before his fingers hit the message icon. Sending you random snap chats about his pet bothering him or complaining about his appetite might be a way he is trying to see if you are awake and thinking about him too.</p> <h2>He laughs at your silly jokes:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1882.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Let’s face it, not everyone has a spicy sense of humor, but even if your sense of humor is borderline cringe and he still laughs at it? Well you have got yourself a keeper because if he is willing to look past your flaws and take care of your feelings at the same time then he really does like you!</p>     <h2>He is engaged with you without a ring:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1883.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Acting like a couple when you are not. He wants to cuddle with you, share a bucket of popcorn, give your shoulders a massage, take you out and listen to your every dream and complain. You guys are basically sharing the life of an engaged couple without even being engaged in the first place! And he hasn’t even run away yet and seems to be really into it. Is there any doubt left that he likes you?</p> <h2>He notices everything about you:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1884.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Got new highlights? If he notices this small detail he clearly observed you in detail to know the difference. Didn’t get enough sleep last night and concealed the dark circles under your eyes but he still notices them and voices his concern? You put on shimmer instead of clear lip gloss and he still compliments you on it? If he studied history like he studies you than he definitely wants that ‘A’ grade.</p> <h2>He talks to you all the time:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1885.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Every relationship has its limits, if the man only wants to be friends he would limit his texting to a particular time. If the man just wants to hook up he would text you when he wants just that, But if a man really wants your attention for romantic purposes he would text you the whole day, trying to get to know you more or trying to know what is going on in your life so he can find a reason to relate to you as well.</p> <h2>He is not just pushing for physical intimacy:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1886.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If the man was just interested in you for the physical intimacy he would not go to extreme measures as to getting to know you in depth as he is does now. He would not invest time, effort and money just to get laid. If he is doing all of that and not pushing you to sleep with him well he is definitely crushing on you hard.</p> <h2>He finds little excuses to meet you:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1887.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>When a guy really likes you, he will find the silliest excuses to meet you. You’ll know it when he claims he was just in the neighborhood when he decided to drop by and he looks and sounds fresh which clearly shows he is in the neighborhood for one thing and that is you!</p> <h2>He introduces you to his family:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1888.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Guys only introduce girls they want around for a really long time. They don’t bother introducing girls who have no role to play in their life to their family.</p> <p>If you enter Mickey’s clubhouse you are definitely on the list to be the new Minnie mouse for Mickey. You’ll even find out from his family’s sly glances if he likes you or not because let’s face it there is always that eager sibling or mother who gives it away.</p> <h2>He is protective about you:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1889.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>This is a quality that is sort of hard to tell if it is just brotherly or more on the basis of lover like. If you were like a sister to him he would have told you that by now, if he has not said that yet and is still protective over you well then consider yourself safe to assume that his feelings of protectiveness stem from romance he feels for you.</p> <h2>He gets jealous easily:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1890.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Some guys are better at hiding jealousy than others. You need to keep an eye out for all the tell-tale signs like clenching of fist, flaring of the nostrils, or the roll of the eyes that come with you flirting or talking with other guys. Correct me if I am wrong but guys only get jealous about girls they like right?</p> <h2>He is interested in anything that lets him know more about you:</h2>     <p>He wants to meet your friends and family to not only raise his prospects as a potential boyfriend in your eyes but to know more about you from people who know you best. Have known you best for a while. If he is eager he is clearly eager to want to know you even more.</p>   <i></i>
