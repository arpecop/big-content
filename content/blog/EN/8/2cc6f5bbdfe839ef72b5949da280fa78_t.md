If their parents support them, nothing could be better for their self-confidence.</p> <p>One smart animator and equally smart father named Thomas Romain had a really bright idea. His young son showed quite a bit of talent and creativity in his drawings. Hence, Domain decided to make use of this raw and brilliant imagination for his own anime characters. Check out the awesome results below!</p> <h2>Disturbing, Yet Amazing</h2>      <p> Father and Sons' Design Workshop You'll find making-of videos and drawing advice on my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thomasromain Please check it out and support us!

Here, we can see a monster who apparently really, really likes blood. He is holding a multi-pronged sword and has a weird light bulb for a hand in the original.</p> <p>In the father’s remaking, the monster has developed into a complete warrior and terrorizer. With literally bloodshot eyes and dripping teeth with the same redness, it’s enough to strike terror into anyone’s heart. When they’re not gasping at the sheer awesomeness of it all, that is.</p> <p>Commenters on this picture are torn between appreciating the son’s creative level and the talent of his father. Some have expressed concern over the violent image in the child’s drawing. However, others have rightly said that this sort of violence is probably found in almost every kid’s work.</p> <h2>The Green-Caped Gentleman</h2>      <p> Father and Sons' Design Workshop You'll find making-of videos and drawing advice on my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thomasromain Please check it out and support us!

He wears a green cape, has an addition sign for a left eye, and sports a top hat with what looks like a doctor’s light attached to the front.</p> <p>The father has added another character to this one, perfectly complementing it with a scarlet-clad, female figure. The top hats are a fun and quirky throwback to old British movies and it seems like there might be a good story here.</p> <p>The comments on these images have marveled at the detail in the little tyke’s drawing, and with good reason. There is also a general feeling that we’ve interrupted these characters right in the middle of an interesting story.</p> <h2>The Veiled King</h2>      <p> Father and Sons' Design Workshop No.44 : Red Crystal Mage Original design by my son Itsuki (8) You'll find making-of videos and drawing advice on my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thomasromain Please check it out and support us!

We’re sure if we thought hard day and night, we wouldn’t be able to come up with a crazier version of a king. This kid definitely takes after his father in both talent and creativity! Some commuters, however, have expressed their worry at the symbols on the cloak, claiming that they were “666”. As those with some Christian knowledge would recognize, this is the number of the Beast as described in the Bible.</p> <p>However, the father apparently did not see it that way. He transformed those six-like icons into spirals for a kingly cloak. And let’s not forget how he noticed the book in the left hand and made it into a complete tome! The kitty on the boy’s book has now become a demon king on the tome’s cover.</p> <h2>The Shaded Knight</h2>      <p> Father and Sons' Design Workshop You'll find making-of videos and drawing advice on my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thomasromain Please check it out and support us!

It doesn’t seem like it’s been made by a little boy. The young artist seems a trifled obsessed with mathematical symbols, if we may say so. The design on the left seems to contain some division symbols. We can’t help but notice the cross sign, which he may have seen in any illustration featuring knights.</p> <p>The father’s version stays true to the son’s shading abilities. The knight monster seems to be battling a UFO-like entity in an otherwise peaceful surrounding. Like the doctor above, this character also seems to have quite a story behind him!</p> <h2>Buzz Lightyear Transformed</h2>      <p> Father and Sons' Design Workshop You'll find making-of videos and drawing advice on my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thomasromain Please check it out and support us!

The details here are simply uncanny. It definitely seems like he like the animation Toy Story, as the costume resemble that of the toy astronaut, Buzz Lightyear.</p> <p>His father seems to interpret this drawing as that of an astronaut too, hence the rocket in the background of his work. On closer look, both versions of this creation also seem to be inspired by the villain from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</p> <h2>The Angry Jewelry Box</h2>      <p> Father and Sons' Design Workshop You'll find making-of videos and drawing advice on my Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/thomasromain Please check it out and support us!

The son’s drawing is a rectangle with some scary detailing. However, he has managed to inspire his father into producing a mutant of a jewelry box.</p>     <p>The detailing in the image in the right can cause on to get lost in it. Note the arms made of linked chain, with jewels at the end. We feel a bit sorry for the warrior trying to defend himself from this crazy, angry creature.</p>   <i></i>
