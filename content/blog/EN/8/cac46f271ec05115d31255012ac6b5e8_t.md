You feel their presence around you like when you are feeling lonely. There is a constant need to hug that certain someone and believe that everything will be Okay like before.</p> <p>Although everyone around you is telling you that its better that you left him since he was abusing you, and you just can not muster the courage to tell them to stay quiet? Especially if those people are happily married, having babies or are satisfied with their partners.</p> <p>Well no one will tell you this but it is really normal to miss someone you have been with! Yes, we are all human and we have feelings as our senses doesn’t it? So, lets explore the reasons why you are still unable to get over your abusive partner.</p> <h2>11. You still have a soft-corner for them</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1282.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>This is the reason you are feeling it difficult to forget you ex because you still love them! Yes, that is true because you have spent quite a lot of time with that person and are used to them being around you so it is quite normal to miss them! Just breathe and relax thinking that its fine. Loving someone is not under your control but at the same time it is important for you to realize that the person you were with was abusing you and was tormenting you emotionally!</p> <h2>10. Remember the good times</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1283.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>You are still living in that fantasy where you are remembering the good time you guys spent together while it was all “rosy”. Trust me it is again normal to feel that way! The memories might make you want to cry and relive that moment thinking that such times might never come again and yes that is true. Since you are emotionally drawn towards that person it is difficult to forget them.</p> <h2>9. You blame yourself</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1284.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Okay so this is the toughest part where you think that it was all “your” fault that things took such a turn. Its time to go easy on yourself mate! Trust me this will not lead you anywhere. Instead you will be in that phase where you might want to change things. Like “only if I had not said that to him” or “Oh she just had a bad day and I was also forcing my views on her”. This will not work and you will only find yourself becoming that person living with regrets. The more you think about such things you will find yourself buried in the past and never living your present and future to the fullest.</p> <h2>8. The person you were with had a traumatic past</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1285.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>You believe that your partner behaved in this way because they had a tougher situation in the past and thus ended up becoming like this! This is not the right frame of mind to be in. The fact that you still love them so much, you end up justifying their acts. You tend to associate the current behavior as a result of the past but my dear friend this is not right.</p> <p>No matter how much suffering one has borne in the past it is important not to make others pay for it in the present and in the future. Since you are not a punching bag there are proper medical treatments available for such people. Seeking medical help and talking to some professional about it is better who will suggest a proper treatment based on medications and therapy. Rather than taking it all out on those who love you and want to be with you.</p> <h2>7. You believe that it will change</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1286.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If you are still thinking that the condition is not that severe and it will all change then its better to properly think about it before taking any final decisions. This is important because you should not trade your happiness with anything in the world. It is your right to live a normal and happy life. Thus no one should have the liberty to take that right away from you or destroy your life for their own purposes.</p>     <h2>6. You cannot let it go</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1287.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The fact that you consider the presence of your ex-abuser such a comfort zone that you are not ready to let that go. Although you know that this abuser is also responsible for all the problems in your life but again you are so used to them that it is difficult for you to accept that it is all over!</p> <h2>5. Moving on is making you scared</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1288.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>You think that you will not be able to live without this person and are scared to let someone else come in your life. Since you are still in that emotional phase where you believe that you feel guilty of grabbing those new happy moments in your life. I believe that we as humans tend to shut all the entries of happiness in our lives ourselves.</p> <p>We feel so guilty of moving on and assume that we are cheating on our ex by being contented and smiling. But the reality is that they are no more with us, so each one of us has a right to be loved, and protected by the right kind of people. Hence you must stop feeling guilty and just be happy. It might not only be in the form of having a new relationship it could be anything like a new haircut, or your dream job. So, go get it!</p> <h2>4. You still see them</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1290.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It is not advisable to continue to see your ex in any possible way. This will never let you move on and you will continue to wander in the past. You must stop all kinds of contact and communication with your ex no matter how formal it is in nature. Seeing and communicating with your ex abuser might mean that you are still in that aura where you feel that it might be possible getting back together.</p> <h2>3. You are comparing</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1292.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Even if there are any other people trying to be in your life and loving you, you end up judging them based on your past experience. You might hate the cologne your new potential partner wears just because you like your ex’s choice of perfume! Or “he doesn’t dress like him”, “she does not cook well” might all be the thoughts which are keeping you away from moving on! Just consider the fact that not everyone is the same and no matter the new people you meet might not appear attractive to you. But at the same time, they are just normal and not an abuser like your ex! So, think about it</p> <h2>2. You miss being around the circle</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1294.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Yes, this is yet another miserable feeling that you might experience once you decided to leave your ex. You still miss their friends and family and still picture yourself between them. The urge to find about what your ex is up to might also lead you to maintain contact with their closed ones which could be one reason you are unable to move on! You must stop that immediately and cut off all ties with your tormentor and their circle!</p> <h2>1. Peer pressure</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1296.jpeg"/>Shutterstock     <p>This could be one reason you might not be able to take a decision regarding to move on with your life. You believe that people might judge you negatively about your new relationship status of being single, if you leave your ex. The key is that people might judge you anyway so do what you think is the best for you and live freely!</p>   <i></i>
