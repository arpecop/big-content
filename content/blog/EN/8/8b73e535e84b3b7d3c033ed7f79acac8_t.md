Even the dreary and boring hospitals are trying to incorporate the happiness and feel good factor of this occasion. It is always heartwarming to see the hospital staff get busy with decorating the halls and passageways of otherwise boring white walls. Hospital of all the places needs such overhauls to give the patients those essential pick me ups and a reason to smile and celebrate.</p> <p>We have compiled the following pictures which are excellent ideas for decorating the hospitals and give it that Christmas face lift.</p>      <p> #nurseswag #hospitalchristmasdecorations</p> <p>A post shared by  Crystal Traywick (@crystalatraywick) on Nov 29, 2015 at 9:57am PST</p>   <p></p> <p>This snow covered Christmas tree look is easy to execute since it just requires a few inflated gloves to give it that look and some decoration to complete the look. If anyone is missing a glove from nursing staff this will most probably be the reason. Anyways it looks cute and really creative improvisation to achieve it.</p>  <p>Brilliant hospital Christmas decorations. pic.twitter.com/oZVPigP4Z5</p> <p>‚Äî You Had One Job (@_youhadonejob1) November 22, 2017</p> <p></p> <p>This is another creative take on Christmas decoration while keeping it relevant to the hospital at the same time. This brilliant idea simply makes use of a tinsel garland attached to the wall in the shape of a heart beat monitor display. Again it is very simple and does not make use of a lot of different items to decorate. At the same time it makes the lifeless interiors of hospitals look festive effortlessly. Just make sure the tinsel don‚Äôt flatline!</p>      <p> See what the recycled vial caps can do.. üëçüòÄ #creative #dyi #recycledvialcaps #vialcaps #caps #recycle #hospitalchristmasdecorations #christmasideas #medicalchristmasidea #christmasdecors #hospital #wardstation #hospitalward #candycanelane #nursingisanart #okdi #okaydiay #iloveokdi #onlyinokdi #paskongokdi #christmas2014</p> <p>A post shared by  Mitch Pins (@praying.narsmitch) on Dec 21, 2014 at 10:58am PST</p>   <p></p> <p>This hospital staff was really efficient at recycling stuff instead of just plain discarding it. These used vial caps came in handy to make the passageways look brilliantly lit and kudos to whoever pictured their usage in this manner. Not bad at giving these otherwise festive d√©cor a twist of hospital by incorporating such items.</p>      <p> Frosty, the continence pad snowman! #HospitalChristmasDecorations #nursing #thisnursinglife</p> <p>A post shared by  John Townsend (@jtwnz) on Dec 16, 2014 at 12:38pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Utilizing the absorbent pads like this shown above to make a snowman is brilliant. It just makes use of a pad with a little decoration on the neck and nose for a needless syringe which screams of brilliant improvisation. The tree silhouette made with used cardboard boxes in the background perfectly completes the look for the festive occasion.</p>      <p> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas üéÑ#RNlife #HospitalChristmas</p> <p>A post shared by @ trishcadilli on Nov 30, 2015 at 6:52pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Making a wreath out of empty plastic bottles in this manner might look weird to some but it is absolutely creative for a festive hospital Christmas decoration. The syringe to tie the knot of the bow in the middle perfectly complements the look.</p>      <p> ChristLMAs Tree. Have a holly IGELly Christmas this year‚Ä¶ all credit to our fantastic ODP Kent! #igel #hospitalchristmas @intersurgical #wastenotwantnot</p>     <p>A post shared by  AnderSarah (@megamoon2017) on Dec 4, 2017 at 2:13pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>This hospital staff knew how to rock Christmas decoration using the equipment and resources at their disposal. The result simply speaks volumes about just getting a little creative and you can celebrate the holidays without looking for an actual tree.</p>      <p> Paper cup snowman creeping me out on the ghost shift #diy #happychristmas #hospitalchristmas #snowman #papercupart #papercupsnowman #nighthshift #nightnurse #ghostshift #hehasalookinhiseyes #talentedbunch</p> <p>A post shared by  Lisa Pizza üëΩ (@lisavonzombie) on Dec 17, 2016 at 2:36pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Translating an amazing creative idea into such a reality is always pleasing. The lighting done really brings this snowman to life and will be sure to put a smile on the visitors.</p>      <p> Khloe's Christmas stocking is up and ready for Santa üéÖ üéÑ üéÅ @bendi__ #ourlittlegirl #khloeleeendicott #firstchristmas #hospitalchristmas</p> <p>A post shared by  Kristy Endicottüåª (@k.endicott) on Dec 22, 2014 at 1:44pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>It is all about making the hospital experience as homely as possible and this simple stocking does serve the purpose beautifully.</p>      <p> Paskong-pasko na sa ER. üéÑüíâ #Christmasdecor #ER #hospital #pasko2015 #Christmas2015 #Christmasdecordiy #Christmasdiy #diy #syringe #aseptosyringe #hospitaldecor #hospitalChristmasdecor #CCAH</p> <p>A post shared by  Mitch Pins (@praying.narsmitch) on Nov 24, 2015 at 9:01am PST</p>   <p></p> <p>You could incorporate hospital objects like these needleless syringes to traditional Christmas d√©cor items to give character to otherwise drab and boring walls.</p>      <p> Paskong-pasko na sa ER. üéÑüíâ #Christmasdecor #ER #hospital #pasko2015 #Christmas2015 #Christmasdecordiy #Christmasdiy #diy #syringe #aseptosyringe #hospitaldecor #hospitalChristmasdecor #CCAH</p> <p>A post shared by  Mitch Pins (@praying.narsmitch) on Nov 24, 2015 at 9:01am PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Always remember to use one or otherwise you might get something you did not ask for in the first place.</p>      <p> It's the most wonderful time of the year!!! @jodieejoo ‚õÑÔ∏èüéÖüéÑüéÅ #condomchristmastree</p> <p>A post shared by  Hattie Mills (@harriettmills) on Dec 10, 2014 at 10:29am PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Another creative take on Christmas tree using condoms.</p> <p>These decorations are just a little way to add some excitement and celebratory character to the otherwise sterile and lifeless walls and hallways of hospital. After all it is that time of the year when no one should be left behind from rejoicing and feeling happy.</p> <p>Out of all the people, those who are struggling with their ailments in the hospital deserve the most of the festive season‚Äôs happiness. By making these little efforts hospital staff do their best to bring as much festivities into the hospital as possible.</p>     <p>As there is no other way to get these people to enjoy these celebrations from the outside world these creative improvisations is the best way to bring Christmas into hospital and put smile on the patient‚Äôs faces.</p>   <i></i>
