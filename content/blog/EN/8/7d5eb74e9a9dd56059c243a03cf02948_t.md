         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 1<p>Now, Kim Kardashian is a reality TV star who’s a multi-millionaire, actress, model, wife of a famous singer and a mother. But before that, Kim was an upcoming stylist and a personal assistant of Paris Hilton. At that time, no one really knew who Kim was. They just saw her as a brunette who’s with Paris Hilton and goes wherever she goes. What we really didn’t know is the way Hilton treated Kim. The behavior was just like treating a stepchild.</p> <p>Paris would make Kim hold a hand fan just so that if she feels hot, Kim could manually cool her down. Paris would literally ignore making eye contact with Kim when she used to talk and would text her what she wanted to say while she was sitting RIGHT NEXT to her. Yes, it’s that weird. Whereas we can say that Kim has literally started from the bottom and now she’s here. Whatever happens, Kim will always be the Robin to Batman. Here are 16 images which will show you what really Kim was.</p> <h2>The embarrassing moment for Kim when Paris let a stranger kick her out of the picture</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-2-10-2229-1-gif.gif"/> Giphy <p>The disrespect is at its peak. Who knew we’ll see a day when Kim was pushed aside by a random stranger on the road just so they can take a picture with another celebrity who isn’t Kim. We didn’t really think we’d see such a day but here we are. We can’t imagine that this is how irrelevant Kim used to be. For the past 10+ years, we see Kim rising and being the hottest topic on the internet. Even today you’ll see them being everywhere, the whole Kardashian/Jenner clan. Kim being this ignored is something we can’t really imagine and it seems impossible.</p> <h2>The time when Paris was getting her feet massaged by Kim</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2229-updated.jpeg"/> JennaGuillaume/Twitter <p>Kim Kardashian West is known as a very fierce entrepreneur and when you hear that she used to massage Paris’s feet, it gives us a big shock. Since Kim’s sex tape got leaked, the whole family hasn’t been off media, ever! Kim Kardashian is now worth of $45.5 million. But seeing Kim massaging Paris’s feet in the past, shows us how much of a crazy boss Paris really was. But let’s keep in mind that Paris’s net worth is more than double than Kim that is $100 million. And also that Paris’s dad has a net worth of $300 which is more than double than Kim’s husband, Kanye. Kanye has a net worth of $160 million.</p> <h2>When Paris and Nicole told Kim to go from the side door instead of revolving door with them</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-2-10-2229-3-gif.gif"/> Giphy <p>The friendship between Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie seemed like it’s going to last forever. The two grew up together in Hollywood and also started their own reality show from 2003-2007. All of a sudden, the two started hating each other and no one knows why. But it is said that in 2005, Nicole showed a ‘not-so-popular’ coitus video to her at a party. They were never like before after that but still are in good terms nowadays. But when they were together, Nicole didn’t treat Kim any better than how Paris did. The attitude of Paris and Nicole was the same towards Kim.</p> <h2>The time when Paris told Kim to clean her closet</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-2-10-2229-4-gif.gif"/> Tumblr.com via Giphy <p>If you think that being a celebrity’s assistant is all glamour and fun, it’s not. It’s actually a very demanding work. There is a bunch of things which the assistant has to do like booking appointments, organizing travels, traveling with the celebrity, managing fan mail, buying personal things like gifts and lastly, cleaning their closets as well. Paris used to order Kim t clean her closet. Paris’s closet is probably bigger than most houses. Personal assistants have to be very calm because if their boss is like Paris, they’ll go crazy.</p> <h2>The moment when Paris told Kim to shut up when she’s talking</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-2-10-2229-5-gif.gif"/> Tumblr.com via Giphy <p>Literally it’s so unbelievable when you hear that Paris used to say “Shut up” to Kim. Kim is literally such a boss and when we hear this, it shocks us! Kim was literally treated like a dog. Paris has a dog in her lap and it seems like he’s snarling at Kim too. If you see the woman on the right of Kim, even she’s giving a look to Kim and being like know you place Kim. It’s like, the dog, Paris and the lady aren’t liking the presence of Kim. Thank God Kim is doing her own thing now and doesn’t have to face this all.</p> <h2>The LOL time when Paris made Kim wear the same costume as hers but less cute</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2229-updated-1.jpeg"/> Tumblr <p>Such picture prove to us that Kim has come a long way in life. Just see the way Kim is looking at Paris. LMAO. Paris treated Kim as a disposable person but was also important for her. She didn’t really like Kim but still used to hang out with her for probably personal gain. Well that’s why Paris decided to dress Kim up for Halloween, like her but not exactly like her. Well, Paris dressed up as the proper version of the character but made Kim look like the “knock-off” version. Did you ever imagine Kim wearing a “knock off” version of a costume? Neither did us. And clearly, Kim wasn’t even allowed to wear shades.</p> <h2>The time when Kim tried to take a picture with Hilton and she smoothly escaped</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2229-updated-2.jpeg"/> Ellle.mx <p>Paris is savage tbh. She curved Kim before we even knew what his word meant. Probably that’s where they got the term. As you can see in the picture, Kim is trying to hold Paris for a picture but Paris is smoothly getting away as if she’s not feeling it. See the look on Kim’s face. It’s totally priceless.</p>     <h2>And again, Paris made Kim clean her closet</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2229-updated-3.jpeg"/> ChellzLauree / Twitter <p>Yes guys, its round 2 now of Kim cleaning Paris’s closet. As mentioned before, Paris has a HUGE closet and will easily take a day to clean out her closet. Paris used to instruct Kim how to clean her closet and if you see Kim now, she has individuals to clean her whole house. Therefore it seems very unusual to think that Kim used to clean Paris’s closet. We kinda think Paris would’ve made Kim wear the maid outfit when she used to clean her closet.</p> <h2>The moment when Kim was called Paris’s maid by Nicole</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2229-updated-4.jpeg"/> Twitter <p>Let’s not forget the time when Paris’s on and off again best friend, Nicole Richie, called Kim Kardashian West Paris’s maid. When you think about the fact that such pictures are all over the internet, it’s no shock that Kimmy will always be in Paris’s shadows. You can’t let go of such stuff. Nicole made it so obvious that Paris used to have a lot of force over Kim. When someone calls you another person’s maid, it’s so obvious that you were considered as a second-class person.</p> <h2>The time when Paris thought it’ll be funny to create awkwardness between Kimmy and JT</h2>  <p>I love this pic of Paris and an out-of-place Kim and a bewildered Justin Timberlake. pic.twitter.com/bV5ZXxgDnj</p> <p>— Jamie Tuohy (@JamieTuohy) May 9, 2014</p> <p></p> <p>This is totally messed up. Just look at poor Kim Kardashian’s face. It’s like JT is not interested to play any games with poor Kim. What did kimmy even do that was this bad that JT is paying 0 attention to her? It’s probably because of Paris, as she’s pointing at Kim’s face in a “I win ha ha” way. And Kim is looking at JT like “Oh God, I’m so sorry”.</p> <h2>Paris was in charge of who Kim could talk to</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-2-10-2229-11-gif.gif"/> Bustle.com via Giphy <p>Isn’t this a funny view! A fan is walking towards Paris and ignoring Kim like a pro. Now if you see the situation, Kim Kardashian West is the most popular reality TV star and is so much more popular than Paris nowadays. But if you see above, Kim is being told by Paris that just keep on walking and don’t talk at all. It’s just weird to see Kim being ignored like that.</p> <h2>After falling out, when Paris and her sister made Kim feel unwanted</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2229-updated-5.jpeg"/> in.qq.com <p>In this picture, you can see Paris sitting with her sister and Kim Kardashian at a Fashion show that happened in the past. Someone who’s blind can even see the level of uncomfortableness between the 3 girlies. This picture is taken after Kimmy and Paris had ended their “so called’ friendship and business alliance. Paris and her sister are talking about Kim while sitting RIGHT next to her and this is making Kim feel very awkward. Well shame of paris for being such a bossy person.</p> <h2>The time when Paris made an indirect joke</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2229-updated.png"/> Tumblr <p>Okay so this was super harsh. (After Kim and Paris’s friendship had ended) Paris was asked, in an interview, that who’s your favorite Kardashian? Who knows with what intension was the question asked by the interviewer but it was asked anyway. We thought maybe Paris would reply with “Robert” or most probably “Kim K” but her harsh reply was “Ray J” who’s not a Kardashian but the one with whom Kim’s sex tape was leaked. That’s like SO wrong. Hilton is very lucky that Kim hasn’t taken any revenge.</p> <h2>The moment when Nicole and Paris were bitchy about a ‘Kim’ girl they knew</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2229-updated-6.jpeg"/> Archives/Starcasm <p>This is literally a mean thing done by the two, Paris and Nicole. Ho is a very common name among Asians. As seen in this picture, after knowing what the girl’s name is, Paris and Nicole tell Kim Hoe about a girl they know who’s name is Kim too. And that she’s a Ho too (As in hoe).</p> <h2>Even after friendship, Paris’s name made Kim feel uncomfy</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-2-10-2229-15-gif.gif"/> Rebloggy.com via Giphy <p>Above you can see that Kim is regularly laughing but if you see rest of the interview, you can see the uncomfortableness on Kim’s face when the interviewer said Paris’s name. The interview was not so long after the friendship between the two ended. During the interview, Kim tried so hard to stay normal when Paris’s name was said that the obvious reaction of Kim was something we can’t forget or let go off.</p> <h2>The time when Paris told what really isn’t true</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2229-updated-7.jpeg"/> Fearlessoutsold/Twitter <p>Kim was first known as Paris’s best friend and side kick and when she came in Hollywood, she WORKED for Paris. The friendship has given a lot of exposure to Kim until it turned sour. We thought that Kim and her family owned ray-J their lives but that’s not what Paris feels. She thinks that she’s the one who got Kim K famous. Kim definitely owns Paris some ass whooping but definitely not her life.</p>     <p>What did you guys think about the life of Kim K before she became the World’s best reality star?
