And ‘Guinness book of World Records’ gave this deadly title. There had been about 238 shark attacks in and around the beach up till now because this popular surfing spot with cozy and warmer water seems to attract sharks. A scary statistical survey is that this Florida is the most likely place in the world for you to get bitten by a shark.</p> <h2>HEARD ISLAND ANTARTICA</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2226-2-jpg.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>The Territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands is an Australian owned island comprising of a volcanic group of barren Antarctic islands, about two-thirds of the way from Madagascar to Antarctica and 4100 Km south-west of Perth. Most people prefer a beach with plenty of sunshine. Heard Island’s waters are frigidly and hazardously cold. And this could aggravate the risk of hypothermia for surfers and swimmers! The island contains one of the two active volcanoes in Australia, Mawson Peak, which further increases its danger factor.</p> <p>Despite all the factors that increase the risks at Heard Island, it still attracts many surfers.</p> <h2>AUSTRALIA: CAPE TRIBULATION</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2226-3-jpg.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>This beach is an amazing natural attraction because of its tropical climate and beautiful scenery. But wild animals like cassowaries, venomous snakes and crocodiles also inhabit, resulting in an increase in the risks of human safety.</p> <p>Things get real in the rainy season. Stingy translucent box Jellyfish are abundant near the shore in that time of the year. It is recognized as world’s most poisonous jellyfish, they can kill a swimmer in few minutes if stung. Poison of this deadly sea fish attacks and harm the cardiovascular vascular system, causing swimmers to drown. They have caused 70 deaths so far.</p> <p>Stinging trees in the island also adds much more to its danger-identity. This tree has large heart-shaped leaves, with jagged edges, and very fine hairs on the leaves. It has red berries hanging from the trunk which are very tempting to try and touch. If you touch a leaf, you can receive a very painful sting, which can last for a long time. These trees are generally found on the edge of forest clearings – they are one of the pioneer species which helps regenerate a gap in the forest.</p> <h2>PRAIA DE BOA VIAGEM, BRAZIL</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2226-4-jpg.jpeg"/> Wikimedia <p>This island of Brazil has 4 out of 5 rating at tripadviser.com and boasts warm waters and pleasing sites but like many of the Brazilian beaches, Praia De Boa Viagem had also been plagued by shark attacks. These coastal waters are home to many aggressive sharks, and in the last 20 years a spate of attacks has made this one of the most dangerous places in the world to swim. After 1992, 50 shark attacks have been reported, nineteen of which are fatal.</p> <p>Worldwide shark attack fatality rate is currently about 16% but in this part of the world it has gone up to 37%!</p> <p>Blame lies with recent environmental disturbances in the region. Lot of beachgoers – and aggressive bull sharks share the water at the same time. And the tourist’s site of this beach is just next to a trench that sharks use as a migratory route.</p> <h2>SHENZEN CHINA</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2226-5-jpg.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>Situated on the northern shore of Mir’s Bay along the Yantian district coastline, Dameisha beach is the popular and most crowded spot for local and foreign tourists. And its ferocious over-crowding makes it less peaceful and more dangerous as compared to other beaches in the world. Last summers, it received 48000 tourists in just 3 days. Because of so many people in Dameish, accidents like drowning especially of children under the age of fifteen have been known and are obvious to happen. And the ratios of accidents are on the rise.</p> <p>The crime rate of Shenzen is also higher than other cities!</p> <p>This is probably the only beach in the world where you have to be very cautious of humans not animals.</p> <h2>PLAYA ZIPOLITE MEXICO</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2226-6-jpg.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p><strong>‘The Beach of the Dead’</strong> as it is known, is located in Mexico. The low-key beach resort is popular because of its strong surf and for being one of <strong>Mexico’s</strong> very few nude beaches. Zipolite is one of Mexico’s three death beaches. The huge and beautiful waves of zipolite have taken many lives who remain unsurped of warnings. Adjacent circular flows travel in opposite directions resulting swimmers to be pushed towards the sea water or are drawn out to sea. Many swimmers have been taken away by an undertow or undercurrents while swimming near the rocks on the western flank of Zipolite beach. The sparkling waters made it enough worthy to be included in the list of world’s most dangerous beaches.</p> <h2>STAITHES BEACH YORKSHIRE</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2226-7-jpg.jpeg"/> Geograph <p>Repeatedly failing to meet European Union standards for cleanliness and sanitation, Staithes beach was once described by the campaign group ‘Surfers against Sewage’ as one of the disgusting in Europe due to its contaminated and polluted water.
