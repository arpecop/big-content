Pixar is one of the biggest names that offer us these amazing works year after year. However, when we’re watching such movies, we may tend to think of them as just cartoons. What we tend to forget is that even cartoons can teach us a whole lot of lessons.</p> <p>In fact, many of the lessons Pixar movies teach us are about ourselves. We’ll be taking a look at some of the hidden psychological implications in some of your favorite Pixar flicks:</p> <h2>8. Finding Dory (2016)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-738.jpeg"/>wikimedia <p>This adorable Pixar creation of Finding <em>Nemo</em> was a roaring success. Children all over the world watched it back to back all day long. This drove parents crazy, but the majority of them quite like it too. Needless to say, the merchandise related to this movie also flew off the racks when the craze was going on. Then, of course, there was its long-awaited sequel, Finding Dory.</p> <p>Finding Dory doesn’t revolve around any romantic interests, but how the loveable fish finds her parents. At the same time, her clownfish friends are on a hunt for her. However, there is an added difficulty. Dory is not what one would call a regular fish, even by cartoon standards. She suffers from short-term memory loss. This means that her memory usually blacks out, which leads to her behaving strangely for the most part.</p> <p>In the movie, however, this peculiarity is eventually embraced by Dory’s parents. By extension, this teaches the viewers to respect and accept those who seem different. Differences only serve to make life more fun and fulfilling.</p> <h2>7. The Good Dinosaur (2015)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-739.jpeg"/>wikimedia <p>This animated movie is about a little boy and a huge dinosaur. They become friends with each other. However, the dinosaur Arlo has to overcome several fears in order to achieve true happiness. The friendship between him and the boy greatly helps out in this case. The movie also shows a setting where nature takes over civilization instead of the other way round.</p> <p>When children see this movie, they may only enjoy the bright colors and fun story. However, older viewers can also take this work as a life lesson. It could thus serve to teach many a valuable lesson on how important and powerful true friendship can be.</p> <h2>6. Inside Out (2015)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-740.jpeg"/>wikimedia <p>This was another greatly popular movie. It is highly colorful and relatable in many ways to viewers of all ages. Most of us experience a wide range of emotions, and this work does a great job of recognizing this. It is also fun and maybe a bit sad to see how we lose certain parts of ourselves as we grow up.</p> <p>Perhaps one of the main lessons in Inside Out is that one should not be afraid of expressing their emotions. The main character, a girl named Riley, has several feelings within herself. These feelings are the main crux of the whole story. As a result, the animation is a psychotherapist-approved way of learning how one can experience a range of emotions. This could be a precious lesson not just for kids, but potentially confused adults too.</p> <h2>5. WALL-E (2008)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-741.jpeg"/>wikimedia <p>Again, this is one of the best-loved Pixar creations to date. Wall-E is the name of a robot that has been programmed to clean up the earth. The catch, however, is that earth became way too polluted for human habitation long ago. As a result, the cute little robot is perhaps the only self-moving creation on the planet.</p> <p>Still, Wall-E persists in making cubes of garbage and staking them high for a number of his days. The humans, meanwhile, are enjoying their permanent residence up in space. They float around on chairs and are immersed in their nonstop entertainment and eating. They are hence extremely obese and many of them have probably never walked in their life.</p>     <p>Needless to say, this movie gives us an idea of where we’re heading. Watching it could teach us a valuable lesson on saving the planet. We may thus realize that we have a responsibility to where we live and to ourselves. It may be time to come out of our devices, look around us, and take action before it’s too late.</p> <h2>4. The Incredibles (2004)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-742.jpeg"/>wikimedia <p>The sequel to this movie is long overdue, and we’re waiting for it impatiently. However, the original work is worth rewatching in the meantime. This is because it teaches us not to surprise or be ashamed of our natural talents.</p> <p>The Incredibles is a movie about a family of superheroes. They are living a somewhat ordinary life, but none of them are really happy like this. By the end of the film, however, they have returned to the work they were meant to do. As a result, each of the characters is much happier than they were at the beginning.</p> <p>The takeaway here is that we all have some skill or talent, or something that we’re good at. Suppressing and rejecting this part of yourself would only make us unhappy in the long run. This could then lead to failed careers and generally miserable lives. So go for what you’re good at and do what you love!</p> <h2>3. Brave (2012)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-743.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>Stereotypes are everywhere, and women usually have to be more limited by them. However, Brave has a female protagonist who actively struggles against the expectations levied on her by her own family. Being a girl, she is treated differently from the way she wants to be. If society had their way, she would have been married off to someone who won a competition on a fluke.</p> <p>However, Merida is not afraid to go wild and even take an extra step to achieve her dreams. At the end of the movie, she is quite happy to pursue her dreams alone. Hers is perhaps one of the very few princess movies where a prince is not the savior.</p> <p>Watching this movie could teach children and their parents that girls do not have to be limited in any way. The same goes for boys as well. Humans should be free to make their own life decisions. Even their parents can only guide them, but one’s full potential should be recognized and respected.</p> <h2>2. Up (2009)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-745.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>There’s a lot to be said for a movie that shows a whole life flashing by in the first few minutes. Up is an incredible work in several ways. It entertains us, pulls at our heartstrings, and is aesthetically pleasing to boot. It also shows us the inevitable loneliness we feel when we get older. This is quite a tough call or what I essentially a children’s movie. However, Up does all that and much more.</p> <p>Watching this movie makes us root for an old man who wants to fulfill his dream no matter what. His partner in every adventure has passed away and he is on the verge of losing his home. However, he still sets out for the adventure of a lifetime. With the help of a boy scout, Carl manages to realize his dreams just when everything seemed to be ending.</p> <p>If one wants, they can take home a very uplifting lesson from this movie. In a nutshell, one learns that it’s not too late to write that book, go on that trip, or fulfill any dream they put on hold. It may not be with the person you wanted to do it with, nor be the perfect time. However, there is usually a way to get the adventure of a lifetime.</p> <h2>1. Monsters, Inc. (2001)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-747.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>This heartwarming movie does wonders in conveying several lessons in a fun and quirky manner. The story revolves around how monsters get their energy from scaring kids and harvesting their screams. However, by the end of it all, it’s found that the children’s laughter is much more powerful than screams.</p>     <p>One very striking lesson here is that development should not be done with intimidation and force. There is a lot more to be said for getting things done in a respectful, understanding, and kind manner.</p>   <i></i>
