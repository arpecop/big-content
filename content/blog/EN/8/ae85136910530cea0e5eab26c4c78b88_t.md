When Heidi split up with her husband Seal of seven years (which seems like an eternity in Hollywood terms) we all were shocked. Seal told TMZ that the former Victoria’s Secret Angel was having an affair with the security guard before they separated. The British singer added that his top priority was his children’s well-being.</p> <p>The singer has three biological children with the Project Runway host, including Henry, six, Johan, five, and Lou, two. As well as Leni, eight, whom he formally adopted. Heidi also accepted the affair on a television show with Katie Couric and told her about Martin. “He’s been with our family for the last four years,” she said. “He’s cared for our entire family, mostly for our four children, helped us tremendously. I trust him with my children’s life. He’s a great man, you know, and we just got to know each other from a completely different side.”</p> <h2>2.

Moreover, the claims that Kris cheated on Bruce in the early stages of the relationship are par for the course of tabloids trying to dig up dirt buried in her past. And you know what they say — once a cheater, always a cheater.</p> <p>However, it is important to note that there are also couples in Hollywood who take their marriage and relationship seriously and have been enjoying marital bliss for a number of years, and some even decades. But that’s a list for another time.</p> <h2>1.
