description: "If there is one thing this coming allergy season will hold paramount testament to; it is that there is no care, like prevention care. And one place where prevention holds massive, and impactful importance is eating food. Other than the air we breathe, food is the second largest channel of medium for allergen distribution and severe care is required to ensure no one falls ill."

And that is saying something when many of us don’t even have allergies! For every friend or family member that goes through these allergies, life is effectively halted into oblivion has you are stuck by the elephantine barrage of conscience to invest effort and care to these people.</p> <p>But everything aside, if there is one thing this coming allergy season will hold paramount testament to; it is that there is no care, like prevention care. And one place where prevention holds massive, and impactful importance is eating food. Other than the air we breathe, food is the second largest channel of medium for allergen distribution and severe care is required to ensure no one is infected (including us!).</p> <p>So to avoid this antagonizing situation, one must pay severe heed to the food they consume and how it is made. But the issue is exacerbated because in this day and age, food is made through such a complicated process that only the highest level of avoidance and care can prevent allergy triggering. But some research, or grocery awareness can give you huge leaps and bounds in prevention. Today we have compiled some such points that will enlighten you as per the label and how they indicate potential allergy triggers. Read on!</p> <h2>9. Be aware of common allergens</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1229.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>There are a lot of foods that commonly set off reactions in a lot of people. By making note of common allergens, you can make a special effort to avoid foods that contain them. Eight of the most common allergens are:</p>  Soy Peanuts Eggs Tree nuts Wheat Shellfish Milk Fish  <h2>8. Make an effort to learn about derived allergens</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1230.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Learning about common allergens, while useful, is not nearly enough to make sure you keep allergies at bay. Apart from the eight common allergens, there are several other derived allergens that you need to be wary of. Make sure you read the labels and ingredients of everything you consume. Depending on what you are allergic to, there are certain things that you need to be on the lookout for.</p>  Ingredients that are usually derived from eggs which usually include albumin, ovalbumin, Surimi and Lysozyme Things that include peanuts which is a common aggravator. These products include nougat, marzipan, ground nuts etc…. Milk based ingredients, such as casein, lactalbumin, tagatose etc. Milk based products such as ghee, butter etc. should also be looked for closely. Products based on soy, such as miso, soya, tempeh and vegetable protein. Wheat is also present in a majority of products. Foods like flour, cereal and bread contain wheat which can trigger gluten allergies in people. Fish is also hidden in plain sight. Products like barbecue sauce, Worcestershire sauce and Caesar salad dressing all contain fish.  <h2>7. Pay heed to the environment the food is manufactured in</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1231.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>While a clean environment is imperative, there are other things that need to be taken into account when purchasing a product. Most companies produce a wide variety of foods but use the same primary machinery to make their products. This means that residue from other products can find its way into other products. Consequently, you should be cautious while consuming food that might be manufactured in an environment that is laced with common allergens. For example, a granola bar made in a factory that also makes peanut butter bars is prone to have traces of peanuts even if it claims it does not.</p> <h2>6. Be wary of brands that have previously mislabeled food</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1232.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Several brands have previously been held accountable for either accidentally adding allergens or switching ingredients without alerting consumers. By making sure to not purchase from brands like these, you are saving yourself from a potential health hazard. Moreover, pay special attention to ‘may contain’ labels. More often than not, these labels indicate that hidden allergens might be lurking around in your food.</p>     <h2>5. Be careful while choosing restaurants</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1233.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>While picking a place to eat, make sure to pick a place with a solid reputation that is known to be careful with the ingredients that they put in their food. Instead of going for new or hip places, go for established places that have a reputation to protect, thus, would be more careful while preparing their food. By picking a good restaurant, you significantly lower your chances of getting known allergens in your food. If you have a specific allergy, like wheat, you can look for places that are gluten free and specifically target people who are allergic to wheat and its derivatives. Moreover, you should also make an effort to go in times when restaurants are not busy so that the servers will put a special effort into making sure that your food is free of all the allergens that might trigger an adverse reaction.</p> <h2>4. Bring a chef card</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1234.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Chef cards are essentially small pieces of paper that list all your allergies and provide the restaurant staff with information on how to prepare your food. People with severe allergies should never travel without a comprehensive chef card. A chef card should not only have your relevant allergens, but should also contain medical information on how to deal medically with an unfortunate allergic reaction.</p> <h2>3. Fully explain your allergy</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1235.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Take time to fully explain the extent of your allergies. If you go out to eat, make sure that the staff knows exactly what you are allergic to so that they can make a special effort to not only stay from that product, but also all its derivatives. List all the ingredients and its common derivatives that you are allergic to. Don’t disregard any piece of information as unnecessary, as that piece of information might trigger your allergy and send you over the edge. Moreover, carefully explain to them that it is not only ingredients that they need to be careful about. In fact, they should make a special effort to rinse all the utensils and not even cook your food next to a dish that might contain a triggering allergen.</p> <h2>2. Ask about the ingredients</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1236.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>While explaining your allergy is essential, it is barely the first step in making sure that your food does not set off an allergic reaction. Make it a point to ask the server about the details of all the ingredients that go into your food to make sure that none of them are even remotely related to a food group that triggers your allergies. Make sure to ask direct questions linked to your allergens to make sure that nothing sneaks in unnoticed into your food. Moreover, ask if the entire product is made from scratch in the restaurant. If parts of the dish are obtained from somewhere else, there is still a chance that your food might contain allergens.</p> <h2>1. Rely on trusted brands only</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1237.jpeg"/>Shutterstock     <p>Try to make sure that all the food that you eat comes from established brands. These brands often have separate product lines that cater to people with common allergies like nut allergies or gluten allergies. Furthermore, big brands also try to steer clear of common allergens as much as they can. Owing to their established reputation in the market place, big names also make more of an effort to ensure the safety of their customers because they can’t risk tarnishing their reputation.</p>   <i></i>
