But there is something else that makes up our cities, something that is often overlooked by the residents. It determines that particular city’s structure, personality and history: infrastructure. Yes, we are talking about the bus stops, shop windows and pedestrian streets that are scattered around our cities by the dozen. How often do we stop in our tracks to admire these structures? Hardly ever, right? Are the ones in your city even worth admiring?</p> <p>You see, the infrastructure in a city has another purpose other than sheer usefulness – when it’s decorated beautifully and thoughtfully designed, it serves as a city’s makeup! It transforms the dreary and grey surroundings that we are used to into something that could be displayed in an art gallery. Art comes in all shape and sizes, after all, and these 25 designs are the perfect examples of what happens when creativity meets urban aesthetics: awesomeness. Feel free to recreate.</p> <h2>25.
