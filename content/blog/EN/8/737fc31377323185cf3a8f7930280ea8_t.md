         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 3<p>Earth’s environment and climate is changing with time. The main cause behind severe climatic changes is global warming. People use devices and do acts that emit heat energy, which in turn causes an increase in temperature. This increase in temperature is the main reason why the ice sheet in the earth surface is melting. Most of the glaciers are disappearing and turning into the lakes of hot water, but this thing has one positive advantage. For scientists and historians, these melting sheets of ice unveil the past and even the future of our mother earth. Some discoveries made after such melting are as under.</p> <h2>8. The giant virus:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1037.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Scientists have discovered a unique virus near the Kolyma River in Russia that had an age of more than 30,000 years. This giant virus living on the ice is a parasitic creature that lives inside amoebas only and is completely safe for human beings. According to scientists, there is high probability that there might be more viruses living is the ice in frozen form which not only damages the amoebas, but also the complex organisms like human beings. This means that with increase in temperature and the ice melting, there are risks that we might confront some micro organisms that used to infect our ancestors. These can be dangerous, as our immune system is not adapted to such type of viruses; and viruses can’t be killed by taking antibiotics. However this giant virus is the most destructive amoeba virus known till now.</p> <h2>7. Ice maiden:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1038.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>During 1999, some way near the border shared between Chile and Argentina, a volcano 6,700 meters above the sea level, had the dead body of a girl from the Incas civilization. It felt as if the girl died a couple of weeks ago, but that was not the case. The girl actually died 1,500 years ago during a religious ritual, but the low temperature preserved the dead body for the scientists to discover. The low temperature helped the hair, clothes and the body to stay in the original form. There were plates of food, several statues and a hat made from the feathers of an unknown bird found near the girl. The ice maiden was not the only dead body that was found. Near her, the researchers found two more dead bodies of a boy and a girl aging between 6-7 years.</p> <h2>6. Frozen mammoths:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1039.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>In 2010, the scientists found a female mammoth called Yuka in the ice sheets on Siberia (which is among the most mysterious and undiscovered areas in Russia). This mammoth was almost one ton in weight. It was discovered afterwards that the dead body was actually 39,000 years old; but due to the low temperature, even the muscle tissues and the wool got preserved. It was the first time that scientists were able to take the blood samples of a prehistoric beast. Even though some of the body of the mammoth decomposed, there were researches made regarding the specie. Korean scientists however claimed that with the DNA samples, they can clone the whole mammoth and revive the whole specie.</p> <h2>5. The Mummy:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1040.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>Two German tourists while hiking during September 1991, found something very interesting. They found the reserves of a man that was lying on the icy surface where they were travelling. They thought that the body belongs to a tourist or a person who was living near the frozen mountains. It was revealed later that the body was in fact 5,000 years old. This discovery was unusual, as there were residue of the last food that the man had, in his stomach. Later on, the x-ray scans showed that there was an arrowhead in the shoulder of the dead body. This proved that the man was killed by one of his enemies. The man after getting shot by the arrow was lying there under the deep coats of ice, which saved him from the predators. The glacier movement however brought him on the scenes.</p>     <h2>4. The Indian treasure:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1041.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>A French alpinist during his ascent of Mount Blanc found a precious treasure. He found a shinny box that contained packets labelled with the words “Made in India”, with each packet containing round about 100 precious stones. The alpinist instead of taking the treasure home, took it to the police. It was estimated that the total worth of the treasure was approximately 377 thousand dollars. The police then started searching for the origin of this box. The only link that could have been considered was the “Made in India” label. It was then investigated that two plane trashes of Indian flights took place near Mount Blanc. One of those flights got crashed in 1950. The plane was flying from India to New York via London when a miscalculation in altitude caused a collusion with the peak of Mount Blanc. As a result of this crash, 117 passengers died. Their belongings are still lying there on the mountains and this box is considered as one of them.</p> <h2>3. The ancient clothes:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1042.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>In 2011, due to melting of ice in the Lendbreen glacier in Norway, a woolen tunic was found. This tunic gave the idea to the scientists about how the people of ancient time used to dress. The researches then confirmed that the tunic was around 1,500 years old. The scientists say that the size the tunic belonged to a warrior of almost 175 centimeter in height (suggesting from the size of the tunic). Frequent melting of these glaciers in the Norwegian areas can bring up more interesting discoveries.</p> <h2>2. Aircraft wreckage:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1043.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>In 1952, an aircraft crashed into the slope of the Garnette Mountain (in Alaska) and was completely destroyed along with the passengers on board. Soon a research team was formed to investigate the matter and control the wreckage area. But after few days the remains were covered by the thick layer of snow which made it difficult for the team to function. In June 2012, a helicopter captured the remains of the wreckage in a crack of a melting glacier. After this, a research team was formed again, but the work stopped due to continuous changes in the melting glacier. However, in 2013, the scientists concluded that the wreckage move 22 kilometers away from the crash site. Even some of the parts were found in the Lake George.</p> <h2>1. Remains of The First World War:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1045.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com     <p>Remains of the soldiers and other war items like the weapons and the households can be found in a village in Italy where the First World War was fought. This war was fought between the soldiers of Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Italian army over the frozen mountain. It is said that hundreds of soldiers died, many of them could not cop up with the extreme weather condition. During the war, the temperature went below -22°C. These extreme conditions buried the soldiers alive under the snow and they went missing. After a century ago, 80 bodies were found from the melting glaciers. In 2004, three bodies of soldiers were found upside down in the glacier. In 2013, bodies of two more soldiers were found which were preserved along with their personal belongings. Along with a love letter which was written by one of the soldiers to his love, Maria.</p>   <i></i>
