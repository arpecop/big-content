         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 3<p>There is a small group of people in the world. A very special group. They are the healers, the empaths are the ones to whom the world turns to when things go wrong.</p> <p>These people have always been the saviors, the nurturers, the helpers and the care takers. As children you would see them protecting other people from getting bullied and standing up for people who could not stand up for themselves. These kids shared their lunch, made sure that their friend’s homework was done – they helped people study for tests and reminded people when tests were to be taken.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-0-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>In a later stage of their life, they turned into the best uncles and aunties.

They can suddenly feel drained and unhappy – their moods fluctuate as they are taking in so much from their surroundings.</p> <p>You will find them crying over advertisements and every movie that has a sad scene in it. They feel and imagine themselves in other people’s shoes. And that is exactly the reason that makes them understand other people’s pain better.</p> <p>Their friend’s usually tell them to draw lines otherwise people will use them. They are too giving and too forgiving and that is not how it should be.</p> <p>But that certainly does not mean that you take a person’s traits and inner self as their weakness.</p> <p>Because being like this takes a lot of strength. A person needs to be mentally and physically strong to be this kind of support and help to other people. Emotionally intelligent people get to be empaths.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-11-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>And when these people break down, they will knock at your door for help and expect you to understand why they feel the way they feel. Who they are and what they are is not a weakness but a strength. These people are the ones who needy people gravitate towards, they know that they will be taken care off and nurtured back to health. They have a kind heart and a lot to offer.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-12-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>Everyone has a purpose in life and sometimes discovering it can take a very long time. One should know what their nature is like and what their calling is.

This is exactly what will make you grow into the person that you were meant to be.</p>     <p>Not everyone has the strength that you do – so hang on to it.</p>   <i></i>
