These connections are often to well-known media personalities, whether business entrepreneurs, politicians or Hollywood directors.</p> <p>However, these connections aren’t always with individuals on the right side of the law – rappers, for example, often flaunt their connections to street gangs. Whilst it is no surprise when we hear of personalities like Snoop Dogg or B-Real with links to the criminal underworld, there are a number of more surprising celebrities who have such connections.</p> <p>Some of the individuals on our list have seemingly impeccable reputations and are often seen as role models for the younger generations. We bring to you a list of a number of famous personalities who you wouldn’t have guessed have ties with the underworld.</p> <h2>10. Usain Bolt</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1406.jpeg"/>Wikipedia <p>The man dubbed as the ‘fastest man on the plane’ is an inspiration to any prospective athlete. The eleven time world champion sprinter holds world records in the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 4×100 metre relay and is one of the most popular athletes in the worlds. He is the face of Virgin media and has a seemingly squeaky clean reputation.</p> <p>The athlete has been known to publicly support Vybz Kartel, a Jamaican reggae star, who is the imprisoned leader of The Gaza, a notorious street gang in Bolt’s homeland of Jamaica. Bolt has used social media to promote a campaign called ‘Free the Gaza Boss’ which calls for the early release of Vybz Kartel.</p> <h2>9. Son’s of Anarchy’s ‘Happy’</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1407.jpeg"/>Wikipedia <p>David Labrava is best known for playing Sergeant at Arms Happy Lowman on the biker themed crime drama The Son’s of Anarchy. The drama is based on the real life biker gang Hell’s Angels and David was originally hired as a technical adviser due to his first-hand knowledge of the gang. David was a member of the gang before entering Hollywood but is adamant that the gang is not involved in any criminal activity despite the exploits of the gang being well documented. It is likely that he is just keeping quiet to protect himself and his former gang members.</p> <h2>8. Dana White</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1408.jpeg"/>Wikipedia <p>Dana White is well known as the President of the UFC, Ultimate Fighting Championship. Prior to becoming the President, he was the manager for Tito Ortiz, a world famous mixed martial artist who performs in the UFC. Whilst working as a manager, he learnt that the UFC was on sale and contacted two of his childhood friends. The friends, Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta, bought the company and installed Dana White as the President.</p> <p>Before becoming involved with the UFC and travelling to Las Vegas, White had a gym of his own in Boston. The gym attracted the attention of the Winter Hill Gang, who asked for ‘protection money’. Due to death threats from the gang, White fled Boston for Vegas. A wise career move in hindsight.</p> <h2>7. Conor McGregor</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1409.jpeg"/>Wikipedia <p>Conor McGregor is one of the most popular fighters in the world and anyone who has followed his rise to stardom has probably noticed that the man is fascinated with the gangster lifestyle. He has made public references to Mexican drug lord, Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman and the movie ‘Scarface’. He has also been known to move around in the same crowd as the late David Byrne, a member of the Kinahan Gang, who was involved in drug and weapons smuggling.</p> <h2>6. Joe Namath</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1410.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>Namath is a retired NFL quarterback hall of famer. After acquiring fame, he bought shares in a Manhattan based bar that was often visited by celebrities and politicians, but also members of the Luchesse and Gambino crime families. Controversy began to circle around Namath, who was alleged to have been fixing matches, partly due to the company he kept. Due to the media picking up on these ties, the NFL asked Namath to sell any share in the bar. The allegations against Namath were never proven.</p>     <h2>5. Liz Hurley</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1411.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>Liz Hurley is a world famous model and actress who is best known for her good looks and her acting roles in Bedazzled and Austin Powers. At one point she came under media attention due to being romantically involved with Dominic Montemerano, a Colombian crime boss. The two were spotted together holding hands but it is unclear how long they were an item.</p> <h2>4. Marilyn Monroe</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1412.jpeg"/>Wikipedia <p>Marilyn Monroe is perhaps the best known actress of the 1950s and is considered to be a pop culture icon. Prior to her untimely death at the age of 36, she received a great deal of media attention. The night before her passing, she was alleged to have to been with Sam Giancana, a Chicago based crime boss. She was apparently told by Giancana, on this night, not to go public about her affair with President John F. Kennedy.</p> <h2>3. Frank Sinatra</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1413.jpeg"/>Wikipedia <p>Frank SInatra is regarded as a Hollywood hall of famer and is often considered amongst the greatest entertainers and musicians of all time. He was a man known to have connections with the Italian Mafia, and although many members of Hollywood at the time moved in the same circles as members of the Mafia, his links were far deeper than the norm.</p> <p>Sinatra’s family was involved with the Moretti family. His uncle was an armed robber for an affiliated group and his wife was a cousin of one of Moretti’s senior henchmen. Sinatra was also friends with Chicago mobster, Charles Fischetti, and gambling boss, Paul D’Amato. Furthermore, he allegedly paid Lucky Luciano $2 million to further his career.</p> <h2>2. Billy Murray</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1414.jpeg"/>Wikipedia <p>The voice of Captain John Price in the Call of Duty series, he is often cast as a gangster in London based crime films. During his youth, Murray boxed at the West Ham Boxing Club, which was owned by the Kray twins, infamous gangsters in London who were depicted by Tom Hardy in the movie Legend.</p> <p>The gangsters liked his attitude and when he wanted to pursue acting, the twins funded his education at acting school without asking for anything in return. The close relationship can be seen by the fact that Murray acted as a witness for Charlie Kray, a brother of the twins, in court for a drug smuggling case.</p> <h2>1.
