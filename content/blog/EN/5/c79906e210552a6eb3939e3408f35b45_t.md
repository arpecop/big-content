         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -3<p>We have all been there. The throes of air travel that get our jammies in a bunch every time a plane takes off. No matter how well travel companies try to sell it, the truth remains that there is no such thing as perfection in the travel world. Whether commuting by road, rail or sea (air is a given!), there is always a slight chance of mishappenings that range from luggage displacement to stewardess accidents. And yet, it can never hurt to be too safe from these incidents by incorporating safety precautions into our regimen.</p> <p>Better yet, there are a magnitude of shortcuts, hacks, and guides about air travel that will not only help you lighten up the stressful regularities of air travel but will also decode and explain a lot of mysterious explanations to things we always thought about. Why aisle seat armrests are fixed and what are the giant weird numbers on the tip of each runway? Don’t know? Read on to find out the 19 mysterious secrets about air travel that you were never told about (and the airline staff probably doesn’t want you to know!).</p> <h2>Not all jinks on the plane are fixed before take off</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2254-1-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Most of us believe that since an airplane is made up of such intricate, complex parts, it must be as safe as they come. This is, in fact, a commonplace fallacy because the multitude and diversity of the parts works to the undoing of the integrity of the plane. The extent of professionalism and specialization required not even to repair and replace but even inspect is enormous and impossible on a realistic and financial scale.</p> <p>Thus it is only natural that most planes flying in the skies are a shade of their former newly built self and due to the enormity of checks to perform, are sadly flying with a multitude of minor mechanical problems that almost never turn into bigger problems. The world runs on hope and not airplanes, because who needs dreaded flight delays, right?!</p> <h2>Handheld grips on the passenger doors are inside</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2254-2-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Ever see the multitude of handles on the back of airplane passenger doors? Sometimes it seemingly looks like they are ample enough to plug the door right off and take it home along with all the airplane towels you umm borrowed for later. But the real reason those handles exist are very stark in comparison and hold a much deeper connotation. In the event where onboard panic ensues, the flight steward gets to hold on to these handles to the emergency exit while calming the commotion and it prevents them from getting knocked down or plummeting out to their death by staying upright.</p> <h2>The pilot and copilot are served food independently</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2254-3a-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The days of royalty and the poison control methods on their food may be long gone, but the utility of those methods are relevant and valid to this day. Most of all in your airplane cockpits where the safety and health of the pilot are pivotal to the further safety of hundreds of people, and this is a crucial link. For this purpose, many airline companies go to great extents to ensure that airline pilot and copilots are both served different food independently in case one of them is poisoned by the food so the one who is rendered incapable of piloting can be replaced by the other.</p> <h2>Baggage locks are not a viable safeguard from opening</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2254-4-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It turns out that all the dreams you’ve had of safe and secure baggage through the airport by locking the zippers was really just a dream and not the reality. As it turns out, the zipper teeth can easily be undone by prying the teeth open with a pen or pencil. Then the zippers to one side, the mouth can be opened wide to siphon any goods out by a dishonest airport staff person. This can even damage the zipper, meaning you lose even more stuff during your travels.</p> <h2>Your bags often end up searched through despite opposite assurances</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2254-5-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Although most airport policies state that no bad is opened unless it is an odd temperature (too hot or too cold), vibrating or leaking; chances are it has been checked to ensure the components go by the luggage guidelines as well. While this is often to ensure the flight’s safety by making sure there are no explosives or fire starters on board the luggage, it is still a wronging given that we entrust the airport staff with luggage having other mindsets about the situation. So when the zipper looks broken, and your stuff starts to lie about, chances are it has been pried open, and it may not be an unfortunate act of fate.</p> <h2>Luggage insurance seals seal the deal</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2254-6-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Apparently, most airports offer a particular luggage insurance whereby your cargo gets a transparent seal that ensures your bag(s) with integral support. Normally charging a small premium, these seals prevent dishonest staff from rummaging through your possessions, especially when your luggage looks well packed and expensive looking. A worthy investment in our verdict!</p> <h2>Why smoking is not allowed onboard</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2254-7-jpg.jpeg"/>AviationCV.com <p>Most people often attribute the no smoking rule to an existence of the probability of a fire erupting from the cigarette butt which can ignite flame fueling synthetic materials in the cabin which is volatile and reactive in its highly pressurized state. One such tragic incident was the crash of Flight Varig 820 in 1973 when a fire erupted in the lavatory.</p> <p>Passive- second-hand smoke is another such hazard which is sometimes deemed as a health hazard and thus is used to shun smoking on board. However, the air onboard the aircraft is continuously filtered and thus eliminates the smoke-related risk, so we are left with the purely economic reasons to ban smoking on the planes. The smoke of tobacco wears out electronic, and interior components faster and so is avoided through the smoking ban. Just when we began to feel important.</p> <h2>Seven reasons your baggage gets lost during air travel</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2254-8-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It happens to the best of us and mostly for the most annoying causes. The airline company never wills to dig too much and more often than not shows up with your baggage on a later date but even that does not quench your desire to know what really happened with your luggage. Here are seven reasons it might have been delayed in its union with you;</p>      It underwent additional checks that superseded its flight schedule An amateurish employee put your luggage in the wrong trolley (to another country?!) An employee stuck the wrong sticker on your bag, sending it to a wrong flight You hadn’t removed old stickers from your baggage, causing a disturbance in your luggage prospective flight and it ended up with a world tour During a connected flight, your luggage slipped off to the wrong conveyor belt or slipped off the wrong way It fell off the trolley and was left behind, yet this seldom happens and that too to the very unlucky (time for a karma check!) Most airports are fitted with automatic luggage recognition which makes mistakes easy to occur. Incase such a bag is misplaced, you should try leaving your name and contact details outside to help you reunite with your bag.  <h2>Why cell phones must be shut off in flight</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2254-9-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>At reading the heading, you probably considered turning off your cellphone vital to the airplane’s operations and as such felt satisfied with the logic, but the truth is a bit more standing out in contrast. While having no relation to critical component failure in the aircraft, cell phones often garbled radio communications from the airline tower dispatcher and thus were required off, so there was no discrepancy in pilot communications that hold important information.</p> <h2>Airplane staff and their families get reduced air fares</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2254-10-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Most people wonder what incentives do airline staff from working at arduous hours all week. Well, for starters the staff get free or discounted tickets for their families which means the perfect holiday jobs to ensure your family has the perfect vacations. They only have to pay the duties and taxes which ensure the tickets cost a shade of their actual cost, thus being generally free.</p> <p> </p> <h2>Secret lavatory mechanism</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2254-11-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>For all those times when you wanted to use the in-flight lavatory so bad, you were prepared to ram down the door, here is a neat trick you probably won’t use but will comfort in knowing otherwise. Under the no smoking or lavatory signs of most bathroom doors, is a special switch designed to open the door in case of an emergency that requires help from outside. There goes the comfy feeling of privacy inside the airplane lavatory.</p> <h2>Best ticket buying times</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2254-12-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>A common belief is that earlier air tickets yield greater discounts when booking. However, this is not a yardstick measure and often peak times can ensure pricier tickets regardless of when you buy them. However, researchers have found that Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays are the best and the cheapest times to take to the skies. Power to the people!</p> <p> </p> <h2>Flight attendants reciprocate niceness</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2254-13-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Ever felt the feeling that kindness is contagious is human beings? That because it probably is! Flight attendants are no exception to this rule as they like to be treated nicely for all the dozens of people they serve and being polite with them goes a long way! Want more beef, ask nicely and you may be served some first class fillet mignon. Want a new seat? Ask with a compassionate tone, and you maybe be bumped up a class. How well you’re treated is entirely up to you.</p> <h2>Aisle armrests can be raised as well!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2254-14-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Not many people know this, but aisle seats which normally have standard issue fixed armrests have a workaround to raise them as well. A simple look for a small button under them, close to their base and press for infinitely more seat space. Pay heed to the sudden stewardess protests though!</p> <h2>Runways with giant numbers</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2254-15-jpg.jpeg"/>Shuttertsock <p>There are always these giant numbers on the tip of runways that you always wondered about. It turns out the indicate the degrees of the angle the runway is from the magnetic North pole and helps the pilots plan their approach to landing. Eureka moment!</p> <h2>Baggage burglary tipoffs</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2254-16-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Avoid writing your home address on the baggage straight away and try to circle to someone else’s address instead. This way your baggage will still reach you when lost and you avoid potential burglaries. Otherwise, there exist potential gangs of people that note the address and rob houses when you leave for holidays.</p> <h2>Raining cats and dogs</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2254-17-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Your flight staff never told you this, but while your cats will be calm and cool during the flight, dogs tend to become very anxious and like being talked to for their calming down. Writing freddos name on the kennel can help staff talk to and cool down your pet.</p> <h2>Headphone hazard</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2254-18-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If necessary, bring your own pair of headphones if you consider mass sharing a big no-no. It turns out that most airlines carry a reuse policy whereby headphones are cleaned and repackaged for use again, and this can grind quite a few gears for a lot of people. So bring your own pair and avoid God knows what plethora of diseases that mind be in the airline ones. You know you want to.</p> <h2>Breathing countdown</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2254-19-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock     <p>According to a specialist research group, most airplane oxygen masks only boast a total of 12 minutes of oxygen in them and thus must be used smartly and rationally to avoid use when not needed. Spread out for periods of dire need, and this same oxygen can pull you from the pits of near-fatal hyperventilation. Life-saving fact, this.</p>   <i></i>
