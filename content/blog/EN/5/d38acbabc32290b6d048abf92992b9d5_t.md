The researchers and scientists believe it all around the world that the human brain works according to the theory of left brain or right brain dominance. This theory of brain dominance states that every part of the brain functions in its own way through the basic function of the brain which is thinking remains the same.</p> <p>Every part of the brain is designed to function in a specific way and for a specific purpose.  Through hard evidence and studies, it is found that people tend to use one side of their brain better than their other side.</p> <h2>What side are you on?</h2> <p>If you use the right side of your brain more then you left, then you have a unique and subjective way of dealing with the things around you plus you have a firm belief in intuitions and you tend to possess powerful instincts that help you in your daily lifestyle.</p> <p>On the opposing side, if you are a person using the left side of your brain more than your right, you have an objective approach to the life you live. You make rational decisions in your life and you hate absurd things. You are not picky or choosy about the things life throws at you.</p> <h2>The anatomy of brain.</h2> <p>So now let’s look at the anatomy of the brain before we further proceed to test our theory and take the behavior and personality test. As you all know that the brain has two sides and both of these sides are connected by a thick band of nerves and tissues called corpus callosum. This thick band known as corpus callosum is what distinguishes the brain into right hemisphere and left hemisphere.</p> <h2>The theory of brain dominance</h2> <p>Dr.Bruno Dubuc had proposed a theory about the links of the brains. It is generally believed that the right side of your brain controls the left side of your body and the left side of the brains is connected to the right side of the body.</p> <p>So, if you are left-handed that is probably because you use the right side of the brain and it controls your major functions throughout your body.</p> <p>It is also believed that each part of the brain has its specific function to be performed such as the left side of the brain houses the controls for your languages which means that the left side is responsible for the creativity factor that resides inside you. Whereas, the right side of your brain is responsible for more analytical stuff that is why people who are left-handed are good at mathematics. This theory was proposed by Dr Pierre Paul Broca and Dr Karl Wernicke in the nineteenth century.</p> <p>Now let’s test this theory and see if you are really using your left side and you are a creative freak, or if you are a right-brained genius nerd. All you have to do is to perform this small personality test.</p>     <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-29-12-3618-3618-01-jpg.jpeg"/>Tapoos <h2>The personality test</h2> <p>To start with, firstly take a deep breath and see the image given below. You would see two faces. Look at the center of the first face, take a good look at it. After a few minutes, move your eyes to the second face and concentrate on the center of the second face too. What do you see? Which face looks happier than the other? Can you decide on one? Take your time because this will decide what side of the brain you use. This will determine the foundations of your personality and behavior.</p> <p>So, you have taken a good look at both the faces. It was hard to distinguish that which face smiled the more? Yes, they both are exactly the same. They just mirror images of each other.  You have to choose one to decide which side of the brain you use more. You have noted down your answer. Right?</p> <h2>Let’s see what type of personality you possess.</h2> <h2>FACE A</h2> <p>If you have chosen face A as your answer, then you are probably using the left side of your brain according to the above personality test. A person who uses the left side of their brain is always practical in nature. You make reasonable decisions in life and you would rather think from your brain instead of feeling from your heart. Your life is based on your choices that you made from your rational brain because you seldom take matters to your heart.</p> <p>You have a logical approach to everything that comes in your way and you stay put to analyze all the aspects of the situation in front of you before making a ruling. You are never hasty or sensitive, be it your life, friendship, or love. You like to clear the air and see the problem from all the sides before reaching a conclusion or a verdict.</p> <h2>FACE B</h2> <p>If you think that the Face B was smiling a bit more than the Face A, then you are right brained. There is a speck of creativity in everything you do. The things you love doing will have an originality to it. You are good with words and communication because you like to express yourself a lot. You like to paint this world with every color you can find. You have a subjective approach to the decisions you take in your life and your judgments are the images of your heart.</p>     <p>You tend to see everything in a positive aspect and you are resourceful. Your imagination runs like a wild horse because your vision doesn’t have a basic approach to the world you live in.  Basically, you let your heart rule over your kingdom even if it does break you sometimes.</p>   <i></i>
