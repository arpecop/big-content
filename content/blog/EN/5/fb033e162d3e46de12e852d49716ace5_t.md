We have compiled around 17 signs which are going to help you spot a person who’s secretly jealous of you; Read on to find out about them.</p> <h2></h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-990.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>When a person is jealous of somebody, they try to do everything what the other person does. Well, you must be wondering its called inspiration but that’s not what we are pointing out here; the imitation done by envious people around you is sometimes aimed to copy everything you do by trying hard on getting better than you. This ego-driven thought can sometimes force them to cross the lines in order to win over you and impress the world.</p> <h2></h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-991.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Too much sweetness consumes you. Well, this statement can be justified by the fact that sometimes you can be lied in terms of your personality, the science behind is to keep you from thinking that you have room for improvements or to simple make you think you’re perfect. Once you start thinking like that, they take it as an advantage to improve them as far as to getting better. This strategy can or cannot be effective but it all depends on how vigilant you actually are to know what’s going on.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-992.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Envious are abundant around you and you might have noticed certain people who are not that impressed from what you have achieved sometimes. They choose to tell you that you could’ve taken an A* if you had taken an A or some silly claims of telling you that the goal you scored was not impressive enough, even though it won the match for the whole team. These are some of the examples to imagine how they try hard to give you an impression that what you have achieved isn’t worth it.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-993.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Well it is not necessary to come across the envious lads when you achieve something fresh from the oven, but you can actually find them in your daily routine. Jealousy is actually something which grows by time and the ones jealous of you keep you under their sight so they can actually affect your efforts to succeed, negatively.</p> <p>Now you must have noticed one of the girls in the group who points out slightest of mistakes in your project which doesn’t even make sense because you basically are a person to take critic if its constructive but unnecessary comments on your hard work is annoying, isn’t it?</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-994.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>No matter how close you are or how many years you guys have been interacting for, you will always be a rival in their eyes and it’s ridiculous how you have to face unnecessary competition even though you know they are trying too hard an d can’t beat you in your expertise.</p> <p>The best way to tackle them is to focus on improving yourself because that is what they don’t want you to do. Improvement is their breaking point and you must know that they’re trying hard to disable you on realizing that you have room for improvements in your personality, your career, relations or grades.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-995.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Imagine waking up one morning and receiving a message from your close best friend who’s telling you off for no reason? Well this happened with me when a girl I was newly interacting suddenly messaged me claiming that I’m announcing our “relationship” inside the social circle. You can imagine how shock how I must have felt when all of this went through my sight and worse part is that someone actually convinced her on this; you can’t even prove yourself, geez!</p> <p>Result? You lose a good company who could’ve been a good friend in the future. That’s what the envious people around you spread absurd rumors just to make your life hard. Patience is the ultimate solution to this, though!</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-996.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Flaws are one of the realities of our lives and we sometimes cannot change them. If they can be changed, it would take some time for us to figure out something about them but the envious cannot wait to point out how unattractive your crooked teeth are or how emotionally unstable you have been through your teenage even though we all realize that teenage is a time when we figure out who we really are.</p> <p>Since every person knows himself better than anyone, it is recommend to know listen to these unexpected remarks from such people because what they say doesn’t matter; you’re perfect the way you are.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-997.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>There are times when we notice this one person in our social circle that looks at us with disgust or give bad vibes of hatred and we can’t even figure out what we did to them. It gets worse because you don’t usually choose to communicate with such people and they assume it for arrogance. Well it isn’t your fault because receiving unnecessary stares or scowls can annoy us but the best way to get rid of them is to talk it out with them calmly.</p>     <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-998.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>We have people around us who we consider a living blessing. They can be our best friends, fiancé or a loving spouse. Many other relations can be mentioned but these are the ones which have the strongest connections in our lives but what if someone barges in with an intention to kill it slowly for us? The jealous around you usually cross the line to get close to your loved ones and bad mouth you, so they can actually make you lose them. This is like a slow poison where you bond with them diminishes slowly and you sometimes lose them.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-999.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Hearing people compliment you for your work is comforting but sometimes you notice certain people who over do them. Well this can be one of the signs of people who are jealous of you. This is due to the same intention of making you believe there’s no room for improvement in your skills just to stop you from excelling any further. So next time you feel suspicious about a hyperbolic praise, just ignore it as much as you can.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1000.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Well we all go through tough times and sometimes need a push to get back on the track of life and the people close to us usually choose to make us sit to realize that everything’s going to be fine. But not everyone close to you is a friend, you see. If you notice a person giving unnecessary advices which you feel will ruin your efforts more, then this can be one of the strategies to make you sink more in the quicksand. So try your best to give them an impression that you are not affected by your loss, that would be a calmer way to shut them up.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1001.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>It feels so good when you buy a new phone which you bought by saving for 4 months straight, you go up to your friends and tell them you did it. But how ridiculous can it get when one of the girls one-up you by saying she has a better phone? This is one of the scenarios but you can realize how immature it is.</p> <p>Honestly, experiencing one-ups time and again shouldn’t really affect us that much since we know that there’s no contest going on and what we achieved is a result months-old hard work. So it’s a win for you.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1002.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>How can we forget to celebrate when we achieve something? Well, friends are still going to remind you if you do. You arrange something to have a good laugh with friends even though it can get as simple as a pizza party at your place but envious still can’t digest it right? You will notice them refusing your invitation to the party via excuses or if you take a pack of chocolates to college as a treat, they won’t pick it up.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1003.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Not making eye contact is very common for the people around you and it might be a sign of low confidence but our purpose of mentioning it here is for you to notice it in those who you think are showing signs of jealousy. It is noticed a lot that such people don’t choose to make eye contact with you due to the fact that they can’t handle your achievements and their inferiority complex makes it hard for them to cope up.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1004.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>One of the most common signs of jealous people is that you simply can’t convince them on anything. This can be further elaborated through a scenario of your social circle choosing a place to travel. You will notice that every suggestion you give will be turned down by that one person and it can get worse if that particular person is the group “leader.” Well most of the times, the decision concludes on what you had chosen but these can give you the slightest of idea that you’re being envied.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1005.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You must realize that the people who are jealous of you have made it clear in their minds that you are very motivated to achieve your goals and the first thing after several attempts to mess it up for you will be to demotivate you on quitting wheat you have chosen. This is commonly faced by entrepreneurs who face a lot of competition in their lives and such experiences become a part of their lives eventually; they also learn to ignore the comments as much as they can.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1006.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Lastly, when you have really achieved your goals and gained the respect you have been dreaming of, you will notice many people abandoning you. This is because the ones who are jealous of you cannot bear to see you reaching your goals because that was the last place they wanted you to be. The reason behind this kind of attitude is inferiority complex; it gets so severe that it sometimes forces them on self-harm.</p>     <p>It is very important to realize that envious people don’t choose to be like this, they basically grow this trait in their childhoods where lack of adult guidance is scarce and they develop their minds to grow greed for materialistic desires. They can still be helped through realization that what they’re up to, is off no good and they can do so much good to themselves if they go for something they are capable of.
