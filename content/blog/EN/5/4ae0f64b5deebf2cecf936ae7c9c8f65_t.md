While we all start out as more or less rough blocks of marble, it is thus only fair that the adult selves of ours found find life lessons too little too late to have a significant impact on our lives.</p> <p>This culminates with our inbred spirit of not ever trusting a soul (literally not one!) only means that we would be prepared to hear no one but ourselves when it comes to genuinely followed advice. And continuing in that spirit we arrive to the popular discourse of if we could communicate to our younger selves some bitter and harsh realities of life that were learned through regret and grit, what would they be?</p> <p>While some may have health tips in mind, other may focus more on socializing or love oriented maneuvers that help their younger half meander through the endlessly confusing complexities of life in general (and puberty in particular!). But regardless of the direction they crave for, what holds common in all these advices is the urge to set them true to the right path without the need for second chances. So today we have compiled a list of tips that we all can agree would be ceaselessly beneficial for our younger morphs. Read on and see if you can severely relate to any that you may have thought of already!</p> <h2>15. Don’t stress over life’s endless trivialities</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-837.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If there is one thing to note as an adult at this point it is the realization that a large share of our tensions over the years has largely been for cosmetic or superficial things that never last. As humans, most of us become naturally pessimistic and can find any reason to stress. So if faced with our younger selves, it would be pivotal to their life and health (not to mention making bad choices like giving up), that they be told that everything is “alright, alright, alright” -Matthew Mcconaughey. It is more important than it seems!</p> <h2>14. Just don’t smoke. Ever.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-838.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>You will realize how better off you are than the 100% that does and begins to regret it so early in life because they cant give up and hey! You dont have to give up what you havent started!</p> <h2>13. Sleep like a mean bih</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-839.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Snooze for at least seven hours in your nightly siestas. Try to outdo yourself in other (more creative) ways.</p> <h2>12. Follow your dreams, goals and aspirations.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-840.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>You always come first for yourself and if you are going through your teenage do NOT ever give up on your dreams. This is a very hard period to sustain dreams in and lay the foundation of your work, happiness and confidence forever.</p> <h2>11. Study hard.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-841.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>There is a time and place for everything and for studies the time is ripe and nigh. Education will always hold a lot of merit in life and it only makes sense for you to do it in its time. For eg. while one may learn several languages as a kid, the same task seems monumental and elephantine later in life. Don’t ever have to spend your adulthood catching up or making amends to what you did growing up.</p> <h2>10. Invest in your future well</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-842.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Go all in on your entry tests so that you end up where you want to be in life and not where minimum effort gets you. Really now. Regret can undo many a man to smithereens.</p> <h2> 9. Spendthrifts end up pissed.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-843.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Don’t spend money you don’t have on things you don’t need with time you cannot ever replace.</p>     <h2>8. Youthful blues are real</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-844.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Identify with the the fact that this is your youth and this beautiful period of your life never returns. Do all of those things you see people try in movies (and especially Instagram). Travel, read books, have a pet and live up to the brim. These moments will be invaluable when you reflect on life or raise your own children.</p> <h2>7. Exams and school are important, but not everything.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-845.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>No matter how hard you try, for better or worse life will have other plans so keep a wide focus and be conducive to change. Life does defy nature and logic by the end so be prepared for that while keeping your self versatile. This can be done through various steps like attending character development sessions, training sessions and attaining scholarships. Get hands on experience and prepare yourself for the practical world as soon as possible. Apprenticeship is a bonus!</p> <h2>6. Don’t try being cool in the winters.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-846.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Get in a bundle to be as warm as possible by getting to oddly matched (if that’s what it takes) hat, underwear and socks. There is literally no other way to be warm in the winters. Dressup and turn the excuses down low for pete’s sake!</p> <h2>5. Enjoy and respect your parents</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-847.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Your parents are not the right-est at times but they are never wrong. And do not break their heart please. They won’t be here forever! Parents may not be your most informed friends but they will just about be the most honestly good intentioned friends you’ve got.</p> <h2>4. Never take another person’s word for someone else’s character</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-848.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It is vital that you believe that every person to subject to individual judgement and in the end even bad people can do well by you so it is too preemptive and presumptive to lock those out from the get go. Adults are as biased as the next person when it comes to judgmental decisions so always make you own.</p> <h2>3. Guard your personal or intimate information like you guard your life</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-849.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If you feel that you lack the attention to care for your private data, it is better to not have any at all in the first place. And it is best to set passwords everywhere so that access to intrusion is minimized. A lot of lives get destroyed when people gain access to data that’s not there’s and then make it public. If it’s for your eyes only, it best be kept that way. Be aware, please.</p> <h2>2. Break up with any abusive partners now!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-850.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The longer you stay with them, the harder it becomes to leave them in the future and you will be hit with a trainload of regret owing to the delaying of this initiative. So swallow that irritable lump and take the big leap to emotional safety by being the brave (grave too!), mature one in the relationship. You will thank me/us/yourself later.</p> <h2>1. Always remember to follow your heart, aspire to dream and be yourself and nothing more, nothing less</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-851.jpeg"/>Shutterstock     <p>No matter what anyone says or how much they try and scare you into doing one thing, always remember to be yourself and follow your heart. No parent, family, relative or friend can ever know what you truly need or desire and thus you should always follow your heart. Then in the end no matter how things turn out you will know that you ended up the way you desired and will be content in your state.</p>   <i></i>
