         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 4<p>Everyone has their own personality with their own traits – either good or bad. Some of us, however, are gifted with an exalted spirituality, with which we can use in our daily lives to see even the most ordinary things in a very different way. Most definitely not a very common occurrence, a person with a gifted spirituality is often more at peace with themselves and is more comfortable in their own skin than anyone else in the room. These people are natural problem solvers and are always good to have around. Think you know someone with a gifted spirituality or better yet – think that’s you? Read on to find out how these people are and what makes them so special!</p> <h2>A requiem for a dream</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-microsoft-windows-ine-14.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Do you remember what you dreamt of last night? Do you remember those green doughnuts floating in the air that the dragon attacked? Well if you recall old dreams no matter how absurd, this might be you. Spiritually gifted people have been known to record their dreams in some form or another. While most of us shrug them off and don’t even care a lot about our dreams since sometimes they really make no sense, these people often note them down in a diary or journal and try to analyze them as much as possible. Inherently very curious about what and why they dreamed of what they did, spiritually gifted people are often found zoned out in their own thoughts. Can you relate? Snap out of it and let’s move to the next point!</p> <h2>Clear and constant visions</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-microsoft-windows-ine-15.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Has it ever happened to you that you see a new face and instantly imagine them in a scenario they would fit most, only to find out they actually do correspond to that? Her new shirt really makes me think she loves shopping and takes a good amount of time in deciding her outfit, but she seems like an irritating person to be around. The way he types his messages makes him sound like he’s in a rush, but in actuality, he might just be a bad type?</p> <p>You constantly churn up these thoughts in your mind only to see them realize. Not only that, but let’s say you’re pulling out of the driveway and suddenly the image of a car crash flashes in your eyes. You decide you’ll call a cab today and on your way to your destination, you see that car crash. If these illustrations seem familiar to you, it’s because you fit the criteria in this regard. You’re spiritually gifted.</p> <h2>Constant nightmares</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2259-zip-3.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Is that creepy clown from It still haunting you in your dreams? Nightmares are most common in little children since they are the most aware and least oblivious to the spirit realm. When spiritually gifted people are getting their well-deserved shut-eye, they often enter the Delta and Theta stages of sleep where the spirits try waking them up in some way or another. If this doesn’t work out, it turns into nightmares and this, in turn, causes you to wake up. So now the next time when you’re up at an odd hour, don’t blame that horror movie your friends dragged you to. Know that this is another trait of spiritually gifted people.</p> <h2>3 a.m. wake-up calls</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2259-zip-4.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>You’re in bed having a deep sleep after a tiring day. Your body is finally unwinding after a hard day’s toil and you’re dreaming of that pay-raise you’ve constantly been asking your boss for. You finally have it and you just bought your dream car when all of a sudden your eyes open and now you have to go to the bathroom. What a party pooper! (Pun intended).</p> <p>Well, it turns out that between the odd and very early hours of 3 a.m. to 4 a.m., the spirits are most active and are trying to make the most of communicating with you. Often referred to as the ‘spiritual hour’ or the ‘hour of connection’, this is particularly important. The next time you find yourself randomly sitting up in bed around this time, don’t fight it. Instead, lay back and let the visions flow through you. Be open to communication.</p> <h2>Random outbursts of emotion</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2259-zip-5.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>This is arguably the most common experience all those with a gifted spirituality share, but undoubtedly, the least understood one. Very commonly, those with a gifted spirituality will experience random pains and random fears of things that at times don’t even relate to them. These aren’t very random inherently though, as it needs to be borne in mind that they have strong visions often that hold true.</p> <p>These random emotions aren’t always for you though, they are often for someone else. The only issue is, you mostly don’t know who it’s for. Remember that time you suddenly were very afraid of stairs for no reason and found out a week later that a friend fell off them and broke her arm? Because if it’s a yes to anything along these lines, you’re spiritually gifted.</p> <h2>The voices in your head</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2259-zip-6.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Has it ever happened to you that you ask someone a question but the answer pops into your head even before they’ve answered? Or that you hear a knock on the door and before you get to it, you already mentally see who’s there? This is another common occurrence with spiritually gifted people.</p>     <p>For some people, this is in the form of words that appear out of nowhere. For others, it is visions. For a rare minority, it’s just a feeling in your chest. Whatever the case is, as long as you can feel it, embrace it and own it, know that it’s a rare and beautiful feeling and that you are gifted.</p> <h2>That weird tingling feeling</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2259-zip-7.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Have you ever had the weird but strangely welcome and comforting feeling down your spine when you get back your test and you have that A you’ve been working so hard for? Ever had this feeling when you’re trying to get a friend to open up and they finally spill the beans and pour their heart out for you? Have you ever felt this really soothing yet adrenaline-inducing current all over your body when you finally get your hands on that order you placed a month back and have been waiting patiently for?</p> <p>This tingling and tickling is the good vibes getting to you and reacting in what is the most favorable way. For some these may even be so strong they jump for joy or do a quick satisfaction dance. This is your body and mind giving you a loud ‘YES!’ with a nice and big green signal and thumbs up!</p> <h2>Superman’s intuition</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2259-zip-8.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>If you’re a spiritually gifted person, the odds are always stacked in your favor because you have a super strong intuition. Not only is this helpful for just you, but also for those around you and as a matter of fact – even those far away who you care about. Having a strong intuition is the amalgamation of a few or more of the points mentioned above, namely having visions and hearing those voices in your head. This is particularly helpful for people who love trying something new, but it can be a negative power too.</p> <p>Confused? Let’s clear that out. You see, if you have a strong intuition, you can very well predict the outcome of something new you’re going to try, such as maybe a new flavor of ice cream at that one place you’ve been to after a long time. Or perhaps how your interaction with some person will be like. That’s most definitely a good thing, right? Well, the thing is, it can be bad because your opinion formed might be influenced by a past experience.</p> <p>This doesn’t necessarily have to be your own personal experience, but it could very well be. This will keep you not only from trying something new but also hamper you from being experimental. To you, we say – don’t worry and dare to embrace your gift. Be different!</p> <h2>You are empathetic to all</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2259-zip-9.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>You genuinely feel very bad about people stuck in a hard place and you definitely try your best to accommodate them in some way or the other. You sometimes find yourself trapped in what may be a vicious cycle of feelings comprising of hurt, sadness, hope, and power. This is also one of the traits of spiritually gifted. You try your best to help those around you in not only the smallest and most discreet ways but also in big and major ways that might change the course of or even save a life.</p> <p>You genuinely feel for that one friend of yours who didn’t score too well despite them working hard, and you’re always there to help them whenever they need any help of any kind. You don’t hesitate in explaining the concepts to them and always want to share your notes too. This is your empathy speaking and since you’re spiritually gifted, you’re full of it!</p> <h2>Warm, cozy and homely feelings</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2259-zip-1.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>When you get in your car after helping that elderly woman cross the road, you that you just can’t help but feel. The same as laughing hysterically at an inside joke with your friends or coming home to smell that amazing aroma coming from the kitchen when mom’s cooking, this feeling brings you home even in the face of adversity and hostility when you know you’ve done something good. Again, this is also related to another of your traits, namely a strong intuition, and this is a feeling that’s hard to express in words. You definitely are the owner of a spiritually gifted personality!</p> <h2>Stress in between your eyes</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2259-zip-1-1.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Have you ever felt this slight or sometimes maybe even strong pressure between your eyes before having an intuition about something? A short-lived but constant stress that just doesn’t seem to end until your intuition is expressed in words or action? The voices just keep getting louder and louder, don’t they? Well, this due to the effect of your third eye – which is often termed the Chakra monitor. You can sense people’s vibes and the auras they bring with themselves simply by this built-in feature, which not even you can put a finger on. If you were Spiderman, this would be your Spidey sense tingling!</p>     <p>We hope you found this article interesting and can now relate to your spiritually gifted personality or maybe someone you know who has one.
