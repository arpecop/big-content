         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -1<p>American publisher and the official playboy, Hugh Hefner died on Wednesday, 28th September, at the age of 91 due to natural causes. He died in his playboy mansion and now celebrities are posting their respects to him. No doubt, Hefner was a big force in Hollywood and when a legend passes away, great sadness comes with huge response from the people in Hollywood. He hosted amazing parties at his great Playboy Mansion which gathered all, young and old, Hollywood celebs together and they used to enjoy to the fullest. No doubt in that. Celebrities like Kim Kardashian West, Juicy J and Larry King, pay their respect to Hugh. They remember his legacy and some share their story with him too.</p> <p>It’s true that his contributions are large but they also give shadow. Hef’s main aim was to give men the freedom to express their lust for women. Even Hugh used to brag all the time about him sleeping with more than thousand women. His legacy clearly shows that he used to exploit women just to have professional gain. He always used to put women on the second class role. They were just to entertain men and their bodies were just toys with which men could play with.</p> <p>It’s not that Hefner’s life shouldn’t be celebrated. He surely did make a great impact on the American society. His legacy is actually a very complicated one. Hugh Hefner did think of himself as a feminist but obviously for a person of his age, his definition needed to be tuned up!</p> <p>Here is a list of 50 celebrities who tweeted their respects to Hugh Hefner.</p> <h2>1</h2>  <p>We love you #hef #HughHefner pic.twitter.com/gr5DXSH22D</p> <p>— Gene Simmons (@genesimmons) September 28, 2017</p> <p></p> <h2>2</h2>  <p>RIP Hugh Hefner I went to so many of his parties at the Playboy mansion it was legendary you will never be forgotten</p> <p>— juicy j (@therealjuicyj) September 28, 2017</p> <p></p> <h2>3</h2>  <p>RIP to the legendary Hugh Hefner!
