Well if you believe this thing, then you are horribly wrong. Walmart has recently busted this myth by presenting a collection of whole diverse kinds of individuals. We are not associating Walmart with any stupidity or bizarreness; but somehow these acts happen in Walmart only.</p> <p>This world, and more precisely USA, is home to some of the most expressive people alive. These individuals express themselves, no matter how weird or bizarre they look.</p> <p>Ye have brought you a collection of some weird expressions in Walmart that the cameras have recorded. Some of them will surely amuse the hell out of you.</p> <h2>15. The real Burj Khalifa:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-858.jpeg"/>Imgur <p>Everyone knows about the tallest building on earth, the Burj Khalifa. Many of them want to give it a visit. But what if a person tries to copy it? Well, this is how he/she would look while copying the Arabian building. These high heels are not just heels, they are a complete struggle. I have no idea that how is she able to walk with them. May be she wore them to reach the highest shelf in the mart?</p> <h2>14. The scratchy cashier:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-859.jpeg"/>Imgur <p>This one is horrible. You might have seen cashiers being involved in intense matters regarding the cash. But I bet that you must have never seen a cashier with his hand in his pants, scratching the private portion of his body with such easy. It feels as if he is quite hard working. He is so busy with his work that he completely forgot that it’s a public place and doing this in such a place is inappropriate.</p> <h2>13. Expressing her love:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-860.jpeg"/>imgur <p>Well it is a pretty long debate on whether a girl should wear a tight jeans or not. The fact is that many girls wear them. And being honest, tight jeans suits them. Still this picture is too much. Tightness aside, her jeans are a bit too transparent. However, ten on ten for her confidence and the way she expresses her love for things.</p> <h2>12. Inappropriateness, what?</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-861.jpeg"/>Imgur <p>This couple definitely redefined the meaning of relationship goals. Their dressing sense is clearly shouting that they do not care about what people say. And it feels as if the word inappropriateness is nothing more than just a word. Well wearing a bikini and an underwear while shopping needs tons of courage. And they have it.</p> <h2>11. Controlling the uncontrollable:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-862.jpeg"/>Imgur <p>We all know the habit that kids possess in relation to the shopping marts. Yes you guessed it right. Children are always eager and try to find an opportunity to run around the mart. We always thing of tying kids with the shopping trolley, or with their parents. This guy surely turned our imagination into reality. I mean just look at this picture, and feel the satisfaction.</p> <h2>10. Clothing sense getting murdered:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-863.jpeg"/>imgur <p>Have you ever seen a person wearing clothes in an opposite fashion? Like, wearing the underwear on the pants. That would make you feel like a superman. This woman is either a zero in dressing sense or she is trying to compete with the superman.</p> <h2>9. He needs a push:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-864.jpeg"/>imgur <p>It is a general thing that when parents bring their children with them, they either carry them or put them in their shopping trolleys. That is not the case here. The father in this picture is a strong candidate of winning “father of the year” award. He successfully switched the roles with her daughter and made her do the difficult thing i.e. pushing.</p>     <h2>8. Covering the kid:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-865.jpeg"/>imgur <p>Talking about the father of the year made us think that the feminists might blame us for ignoring the moms. Okay, so now, presenting to you, the mom of the year. This lady covered her kid’s face with a plastic bag with for no reason at all.</p> <h2>7. Desperately desperate:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-866.jpeg"/>imgur <p>Men as considered desperate by every woman on this earth. Usually we see relationships getting ended, just because a guy refuses to sacrifice his pride. Then there are guys like the one you are seeing in this picture. This fellow is a complete package of desperation. How can you imagine putting hands in a woman’s pants? That too when you are walking in a public place.</p> <h2>6. Being a beach freak:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-867.jpeg"/>nasoor <p>Imagine a woman, with a moderately good figure, wearing a bikini and posing for a picture. You are imagining a beach? Well that’s not correct. It is Walmart. People even where bikinis during shopping and feel as if it is alright. The thing is that is was, is and will never be alright.</p> <h2>5. The shopaholic patient:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-868.jpeg"/>Imgur <p>If you are lying in your bed in a hospital and suddenly you recall that you are a shopaholic and shopping is better than anything. Well this picture will be the nearest to what you will look like. This is how a shopaholic patient looks like. Poor soul.</p> <h2>4. The braids man:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-869.jpeg"/>Imgur <p>Oh my God! We have seen many awkward thing throughout this list. But this picture is quite unique. From behind it feels like a girl with braids standing. However, to prove you wrong, this is a guy with extremely bizarre hairstyle. You can find this sort of people in Walmart only.</p> <h2>3. 3OH!3</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-870.jpeg"/>imgur <p>Looking at her pants might amuse you first. But this is not a sign saying that the hole that she possesses is too wide. This sign actually belongs to “3OH!3”, which appeared on one of their albums. See, looking at such pictures can educate you and make you learn about new brands. Thank me later.</p> <h2>2. The hanging diaper:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-871.jpeg"/>imgur <p>We are familiar to babies wearing diapers. We have seen babies and infants during the diaper advertisements, which has made us to believe that only the young ones wear the diapers. Well this is not always the case. This picture will break your perception. I still think that the lady never wanted to show this secret. It is just her dress that was not enough to cover it up.</p> <h2>1. The professional wrestler:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-872.jpeg"/>imgur     <p>The hair on the back of this fat guy resemble to the hair wrestlers that used to wrestle during the 70s and 80s era. The hair are too manly and are quite rare nowadays. Seeing such dense and black bushes on the back are considered bizarre in the world that we are living in now.</p>   <i></i>
