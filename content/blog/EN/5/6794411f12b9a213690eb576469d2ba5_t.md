The love shown on the silver screen is a saccharine, unimpressive imitation of the real thing. You see, love is not just warm hugs, passionate looks and butterflies in your stomach – love is imperfect and this is what makes it perfect.</p> <p>Instead, pay attention to the things a guy does around you. The days of being confused about mixed messages are over! Here are 12 things a man who is truly in love will do around you.</p> <h2>12.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1494.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>If he fulfils his promises, no matter how insignificant they may seem, it shows that he considers you a top priority. He is ready to sacrifice his own time in order to help you. For example, if a guy ditches picking you up from the airport just because it’s raining hard, he’s probably not the one for you.</p> <h2>11.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1495.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com  <p>He gives your social circle – both your friends and family – the respect they deserve. He refrains from passing judgement on them and does not avoid them on purpose. He remembers things like your parent’s birthdays and is always considerate of them.</p> <h2>10.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1496.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Unfortunately, jealousy and overprotectiveness have been too romanticized in popular media. It is <em>not</em> romantic for your partner to put you down on a daily basis, keep checks on you, criticize your choices, be suspicious of or obsess over you. A man who truly loves you will shower you with affection unconditionally, support you in whatever way he can while giving you some much-needed alone time.</p> <h2>9.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1497.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>If he doesn’t ditch your movie date for watching some football with his pals, he’s a keeper. For most dudes, their friends always come first. But if he chooses you every time, he’s the one.</p> <h2>8.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1498.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>The easiest way to check if your partner is the one is to note how they react when you are in an upsetting situation. Does he return the consideration you give him when he is in a bad place? Does he do it anyway, regardless of whether you treat him the same or not? He does not love you if he considers your problems – whether it be a failed exam or depression – insignificant and changes the topic or ignores you completely. Someone who loves you will push everything else back and talk to you about your problems in a gentle and non-probing manner. They will provide moral support and listen to you, at the very least.</p>     <h2>7.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1499.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>“I didn’t tell you because I knew you’d agree anyway” just doesn’t cut it. Your partner should understand that any important decision, whether it be buying a new house or investing money in a project, is not complete without both of you involved. Especially when it’s also your money!</p> <h2>6.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1500.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Just like love isn’t perfect, neither are people. If your partner understands this and accepts all your mistakes and downsides, he’s the one. In a relationship, you have to face not just each other’s good sides but also the dark ones. It takes a certain strength and patience to do this and if a man stays beside you despite witnessing you at your worst, he truly loves you.</p> <h2>5.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1501.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>If he visualizes his future in his terms alone, this means that he does not see your relationship lasting in the long term. A man who is deeply in love with you will always include you in his plans. He will ask for your opinion, face the pressing issues rather than ignoring them and solve them with you. An ideal future for him is always going to be one that includes you in a central position.</p> <h2>4.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1502.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>He puts your health above his. Whenever you feel mentally or physically ill, he puts his other priorities aside and takes care of you to the best of his ability. He is always considerate and careful about your wellbeing.</p> <h2>3.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1503.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>No matter how outrageous or crazy the idea may sound, as long it makes you happy and leaves you feeling fulfilled, he will support you no matter what. A man who does not love you will always be wary of your opinion and constantly criticize your decisions and choices. Go for the guy who builds you up, not brings you down.</p> <h2>2.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1504.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>There’s no need for your man to act like your personal fairy godmother and make your every ostentatious wish come true. Instead, someone who truly loves you pays attention to what you say and what you really need. They surprise you often with the little things and strive to make you feel happy and secure.</p> <h2>1.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1505.jpeg"/>Tapoos     <p>There’s nothing more romantic than a man making dinner for you while remembering what you are allergic to. Or presenting to you your favourite flowers, something you had mentioned to him ages ago. This shows that he is fully involved in your personal moments and pays attention to your likes and dislikes. He also remembers the little things and uses them to create fond and precious memories with you.</p>   <i></i>
