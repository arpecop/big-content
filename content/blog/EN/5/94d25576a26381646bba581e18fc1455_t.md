Everyone is naturally attractive but we are only trying to investigate if your Sun sign does predict how irresistible a person will be to others. After all astrological findings do find some reason and weightage even in this day and age. You can read up on the common traits of each zodiac sign and you will realize there is some truth in these findings. According to astrologers women under the signs of Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn, Sagittarius, Leo and Scorpio of the Zodiac are generally more beautiful and will attract men more. There is a consensus however that Pisces is the most attractive out of these five signs. These opinions may vary according to different studies.</p> <p>The fact of the matter is that is it even possible to have such unexplainable magnetism in your personality that will actually attract the opposite gender. As they say beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder but do the positioning of stars and shifts in seasons tip the balance in a person’s favor? Every zodiac sign has their own beauty and traits and different factors contribute to this outward attraction in their person. However actual beauty is highly subjective and you cannot predict it based on the positioning of stars. It is something instinctive and what maybe one man’s idea of beautiful may not be shared by another man. So keeping this in mind we take a look at the qualities and characteristics that make these zodiac signs stand out from the rest.</p> <h2>6. Pisces</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1620.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>They are naturally very romantic in their disposition. Pisces women can effortlessly attract a man simply because of their little acts of romance like appearing full of confidence, not shying away from conveying their feelings. Those subtle hints and clues like adjusting their hair or lightly touching their partner when laughing out at their jokes. These small actions make them highly irresistible to others as they believe actions speak louder than words do. They are looking for someone who is strong and confident and is serious for a long term relationship.
