The couple ran an account on Instagram to show their rears to their 14000 followers pictured in exotic locales around the World.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1622.jpeg"/>BBC <p>Authorities in Thailand however decided they would not take this lying down and decided to take action. Both Joseph and Travis Dasilva have since been taken into custody. While tourists are known to go against local customs in Thailand. Although usually most people get off the hook easily with barely a slap on the wrist or some weird stares.</p> <p>For this unlucky couple however the consequences would be considerably more worrisome however as they have been slapped with a fine of 153 dollars, what is more worrying still is that they could be looking at a 12 year jail sentence. Thai authorities were clearly not amused with their antics.</p>  <p></p>   <p>Serious charges Await Bare-Butts Americans for Stunt at Thai Templehttp://bit.ly/traveling_butts</p> <p>Posted by GayDFW.com on Wednesday, November 29, 2017</p>  <p>Thailand might be a hub for the international sex trade including child sex tourism, however Thai authorities want people to keep things as publically decent as possible and certainly do not take obscenity when it happens on the site of temples in the deeply devout Buddhist nation.</p>     <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1623.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>Thai authorities did not just sweep in suddenly they had signs all over the place telling tourists to dress modestly and to respect the sanctity of the place they were visiting. They are not open to obscene and indecent behavior on the premises of temples at the very least even though they may allow a flourishing sex tourism industry to continue right under noses.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1624.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>Thai law enforcement agencies put the two men on a watch list when they came to know about their picture on social media, however they were not immediately taken into custody and instead they were stopped from leaving the country at the airport in Bangkok and taken into custody.</p> <p>The Instagram account has been taken down since the fiasco and there is no word on when the account will be back online if ever.</p> <p>This was the first time that the pair have run into trouble with the law in their globetrotting. They had previously done similar behavior in many other places around the world and had managed to get away scot free as the authorities would always turn a blind eye.</p> <p>The Dasilvas have gotten into touch with authorities back in the United States in order to get their help in getting themselves out of trouble and back on American soil. The commissioner of San Diego stated that although he was not very happy with their actions he would get in touch with higher authorities to try to work with the government of Thailand to rescue the two men from the consequences of their obscene actions.</p> <p>Respect is very important in Asian cultures and Thailand is no exception. In Thailand disrespecting the king or the royal family or religious places will land people in trouble. The country is also known to strictly enforce lese majesty laws which mean that if you disrespect the monarch or his family you will certainly live to regret it and would looking at several years behind bars.</p> <p>The only out of such a situation is if your home government intervenes in the matter to get you out of such a mess. The United Kingdom and the United States are known to actively bail out citizens in such instances.</p>     <p>Earlier this year the government in Thailand sentenced a man to 35 years in prison for Facebook posts targeting the monarchy. Thailand is a great place to visit however would be tourists should beware of disrespecting what the Thais hold dear their religion and the royal family.</p>   <i></i>
