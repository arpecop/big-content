         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 0<p>In a world of extreme speed, competition, and pressure; it is often impossible to maintain a positive attitude. The demoralizing factors clearly outnumber the reasons to stay motivated. Whether you’re a student, businessman, teacher, writer or an athlete; keeping yourself motivated and thinking positively is one of the greatest challenges that you would face. This article helps you find out the things that you’re missing in your daily routine to live a constructive life. The things that you need to focus on, in order to live a positive life, are:</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-767.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>Make your mind about what you want. The foremost thing that you need is happiness. Stop waiting for things to happen and bring happiness in your life. Try being happy and then see how the things happening around you start flowing in the stream of the happy attitude that you have adapted. Happiness is what you think of something, it is what happens in your mind, not the situations that you face.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-768.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>Calmness is the basic thing that you need in order to tackle the adverse state of affairs. How can someone achieve positive attitude with anxiety playing on the back of his mind? Staying calm, will provide a strong basis to achieve and maintain a positive attitude. Other factors controlling your attitude are second to what state your mind is in.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-769.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>There is a saying ‘you cannot control the uncontrollable’. Do not let the fear of failure affect your progress. The only thing you need to do is to keep putting your best efforts into what you do. The remaining part of the outcome is fate and is uncontrollable. The fear of failing due to fate or the decisions taken by a third party not only demoralizes you but also decreases efficiency of work. On the other hand, the fearless approach leads towards instant boost in positive attitude.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-770.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>Millionaires and entrepreneurs are not made in a day, reading their life story would tell you how much struggle they went through. The reason is that you cannot achieve success in a day; success is earned over a period of time, the length of which depends on the efforts you put in. Avoid getting de-motivated from the fact that you are not achieving hoped for results. Monitor your daily progress, mark slight improvements, and ponder over the deficiencies remaining. Achieving short-termed daily goals will do wonders for your attitude and mood.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-771.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>A good, well managed and well-planned schedule is part and parcel of living a positive life. Positivity is related to whether we achieve the things that we work for. Achieving a goal in daily life depends upon how we time our activities and how we manage our resources, with short, but essential breaks. More efficient management would lead to the more effective completion of the activities we do.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-772.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>Make sure that you start your day on a positive note. Starting your day with worries regarding your grade, profit margins, debt or failures would add more and more pressure; this pressure will then be translated into a completely stressful day.</p> <p>On the contrary, starting the day with a cup of tea, reading healthy and useful articles, light exercise and a small but productive chat with family might lift your mood up and make the day a lot easier.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-773.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>There are two kinds of pleasures that people experience in their lives. Major delights – getting married, graduation, getting a promotion, winning a prize; and minor delights – eating ice cream on weekends, watching a football match with your family and having fun during swimming classes. The major delights are rare and usually come once in a while. On the other hand, minor delights are quite frequent. So one should start enjoying and living the minor successes and pleasures that he/she experiences during his life.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-775.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>One of the most common problems that people face while thinking positively, are unfavorable past experiences that they had. In order to bring positivity in life, one must stop thinking about what happened and should start focusing on the betterment of his present and future.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-777.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>The state of mind and how the individual perceives the situations plays a key role in attaining positive attitude. No matter how worse the situation is, the optimistic people always find something positive. On the contrary, pessimistic minds see nothing but failures in whatever thing they do.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-779.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>Having a defined purpose helps you figure out what you want. Life is difficult, there are many challenges that you would face, but at the end, you can find the shores and steady your ship and align your hardships with the purpose that you have in your life.</p> <p>Having a clear purpose would rarely let you divert in your life, your efforts get concentrated and this in return boosts positivity in your attitude.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-781.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>This includes reading books containing something motivating, listening to music with inspiring lyrics and watching constructive and positive movies; which might aid in battling your way out. Your brain would give output similar to what you put in it. The more positive things you feed into your brain results in more positive thinking and progressive attitude.</p>     <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-782.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>People have a tendency to make tough things tougher for themselves. The basic concept of having a positive attitude is to make things simpler for you. Making things more and more complex would do nothing but demoralize you. Making things simpler does not mean underestimating the situation, but it is all about not over exaggerating the difficulties that you are facing in the completion of your objective or attaining the desired outcome.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-783.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>In your life, either you are a sufferer or a controller. Being passive leads to the victimization of an individual, as he let others control his life. A far better and suitable option is to take control of one’s own life and making things happen, taking responsibility of everything that happens. This will not only give you command over condition but also help you think positive about yourself.</p> <h2></h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-784.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>When the situation is difficult and you are facing difficulties in overcoming it. Then you should imagine yourself succeeding and achieving the thing that you want the most.</p> <p>Mahathir Mohammad (the prime minister of Malaysia) had the vision to transform Malaysia into an economic hub. They aligned all their efforts with the vision that he had. The results are there to be seen; Malaysia’s economy is far better than when it was, during the pre-Mahathir times.</p> <p>Another example is Mohammed Ali Jinnah struggling for independence from the British government and forming a new homeland for the Muslims of the subcontinent and led to the creation of Pakistan. Majority of the Indian population was Hindu and they were all against the partition, but Muhammad Ali Jinnah and his men had the vision to get what they wanted.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-785.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>Moaning and groaning would do nothing but bring negativity in your life. Unnecessary complains about a situation or an outcome implicitly means that you’re putting emphasis on the negative aspects of the outcome. An individual should limit his complaints and concentrate his attention on finding an appropriate solution. This is what you need to do:</p>  Get yourself out of the prevailing circumstances. Change your perspective. Find an appropriate solution. Accept the results and stop whining.  <p>Whining about an outcome adds depression and worsens the situation, all you need to do is to accept the results and start finding a solution to nullify or tackle the problem.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-786.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>Thinking positively is much easier when you start talking to yourself in a positive manner. Research shows that using positive words while self-talking strengthens attitude in a constructive way.</p> <p>Never say ‘I will fail’ or ‘I can’t do it, it’s impossible’. Always use phrases like ‘You have done it before’ or ‘I will get through it no matter what’.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-787.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>A good sense of humor allows you to find positive things in the dullest of situations. Try finding something to laugh about; it works as a tool to neutralize the waves of negativity emerging from an outcome or situation.</p> <p>When you find yourself in an unfavorable situation, ask yourself ‘What’s funny about it?’, this will help you find things to laugh about.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-788.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>Stop doing things merely to extract favorable results, instead try and learn new things. Never let your failures play on your mind, always remain curious, find new things that you have learned from the circumstances you faced.</p> <p>Learning based approach helps you to experience the situation fully and analyze what you need to do, in order to win it next time. All in all, curiosity and interest in a situation bring positivity in life.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-789.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>Positivity is contingent to the surroundings that you have around yourself. Try hanging out with people who have a positive attitude towards their life. Their attitude would not have any direct influence on your life or mood. But in fact, it has an indirect and implicit effect on how you perceive things in your life.</p> <p>Connecting to such people will boost your confidence, mood, attitude and will act as a positive reinforcement on the things that you will do in times to come.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-790.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>It is true that life is unfair and difficult at times, which is why one must stop expecting life to be kind and easy to him every time. Positive attitude requires you to stand up and take everything, that life throws, on your face. Prepare yourself for the worse and do the best that you can do.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-791.jpeg"/>tapoos <p>Even if you use above mentioned techniques, there may exist some conditions where you might face some difficulty dealing with. In such circumstances you should:</p> <p>Consult a friend – consulting a friend and letting him know your problems usually helps because usually, friends are well aware of your lifestyle and your needs.</p> <p>Improving self-esteem – improving self-esteem really helps with tackling attitude problems.</p>     <p>Visit a psychiatrist – this is the last option that you can avail. Involving an expert is not a bad thing. It is usually costly but pretty helpful.</p>   <i></i>
