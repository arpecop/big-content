          <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -5<p>Workplace politics are a universal issue that plague almost every office and occupation around the globe. You know what we are talking about.</p> <p>Have you ever had a co-worker you did not get along with? Something about them just irks you? Have you found yourself having zero tolerance for someone for whatever they say, do, or act like? And, have you just found yourself disagreeing with someone for no reason at all?</p> <p>Well, these little things happen everywhere; from a scale as small as a freelance company to a larger scale like the film industry. That’s right, folks. Workplace politics exist in Hollywood, too. People find themselves disagreeing with their colleagues for a plethora of reasons. May it be jealousy, insecurity, or whatever; these things expose some realities that exist within the place of dreams.</p> <p>Sometimes, when we see an actor or actress on screen, we create a mental image in our heads about their personality. Unfortunately, this is not them in real life. In fact, these are just illusions that we end up seeing and believing. Of course, none of us know the true nature of these stars.</p> <p>What we do know, is that some of these big names have worked alongside each other and have found it to be an absolute nightmare. After tolerating them for years on end, they have come out in public, swearing to never share the big screen with their not-too-liked contemporaries. In order to shed some more light on this issue, we have compiled a list of actors and actresses who have pledged to never act with some of their colleagues.</p> <p>We figured it would be good to keep you informed about some of your biggest idols. In light of that, let us begin!</p> <h2>#14: Tina Fey and Paris Hilton.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-741.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>You might remember Tina Fey from the 2005 chick-flick ‘Mean Girls’. She is undoubtedly one of Hollywood’s shining stars. Regarded for her immense talent and due success, Tina is known to be a generally kind person. This is one of the reasons she has worked with so many other greats – they all love her.</p> <p>Since she is a very nice person, it would be fairly difficult to get on her nerves. But, one such lady, by the name of Paris Hilton, has managed to do just that. Back in 2005, Hilton and Fey appeared on famous talk show <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. They shared the screen together and did not have a lot of good things to say about each other in the aftermath of that episode.</p> <p>Asked about her experience working with Hilton, on <em>The Howard Stern Show</em>, Fey said that she was a piece of sh*t. She went on adding that Hilton was rude to the entire staff and made fun of other actresses for their bodies. She also said that Hilton was not a very good host and that she would never ever work with her again. Fey ended up by saying that Hilton was as bad as a ‘fart in the mitten.’</p> <p>Now, we are not quite sure what that means, but it certainly does not sound good!</p> <h2>#13: James Franco and Tyrese Gibson</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-742.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>Franco and Gibson shared the screen in <em>Annapolis</em>, a 2006 drama film directed by Justin Lin. They looked great together onscreen and brought the perfect ingredients to the table in a fight scene.</p> <p>However, Gibson states that Franco always seemed to have a problem with him and that he vented it out in the form of aggression while filming fighting scenes. After the film was done, Gibson even said that he never wanted to work with Franco again.</p> <p>Whenever a boxing scene was to be shot, Gibson claimed that Franco would actually hit him and that made everything seem very personal. Stating clearly that it left him distraught, Franco, however, had something totally different to say. He said that he was a method actor and got too engrossed in his role.</p> <h2>#12: Lindsay Lohan and America Ferrera.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-743.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>Arguably the most controversial public figure of the last two decades, Lindsay Lohan is not an easy catch. However, the producers of <em>Ugly Betty </em>still found it viable to cast her in their show. After signing up for six episodes, she could only complete four as her behavior started getting out of hand. It was so bad that America Ferrera, the lead actress, request Lohan be taken off the show.</p> <p>The production crew chimed in by saying that Lohan brought with her a ton of problems to the set. She smoked continuously and kept ruining her dressing room. All in all, we pretty much think these two actresses will never be seen onscreen together again.</p> <h2>#11: Shannen Doherty and Alyssa Milano</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-744.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>Shannen Doherty and Alyssa Milano were at loggerheads with each other for as long as one can remember.</p> <p>However, things seemed to have cooled down when Doherty was found to have been suffering from breast cancer. Since then, Milano showed her concern for her co-star’s health. The pair acted together in the 90’ TV show called <em>Charmed</em> and were sisters. However, they did not get along very well, which made Doherty leave the show after only three seasons.</p> <p>Now, even though they are cool with each other, they will not be acting together again.</p> <h2>#10: Jennifer Lopez and Sean Combs</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-745.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>After their break up in 2001, Combs and Lopez have still not found solace after the bitterness that was left with them after the abrupt end of their three-year-long relationship.</p> <p>Once lovebirds, they do not want to work together as of now. Combs, when presented with the opportunity to be a judge on the 13th season of <em>American Idol</em>, refused as he did not want to work with Lopez. He stated that sharing the screen with his ex would be awkward and called it off saying it would either be her or him. In the end, though, Combs declined the offer for once and for all.</p> <h2>#9: Charlie Sheen and Selma Blair</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-746.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>Charlie Sheen is perhaps best known for his amazing sitcoms. He has the ability to singlehandedly garner sky-high ratings and superb reviews. However, another thing he is well known for is his difficult personality. And, when Selma Blair joined him abroad for <em>Anger Management</em>, a 2007 TV show, the chemistry between the two was flawless.</p> <p>When this flawlessness turned into hostility, no one knows. What we do know for sure is that the set turned into quite the horror show and later, Blair was removed after two seasons for lacking creativity. However, Blair could not digest it and in turn filed a lawsuit against the show for $1.2 million. She argued that she was kicked off illegally and had lost wages in the process, too.</p> <p>From this, it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that they will never be working together again.</p>     <h2>#8: Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-747.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>Best known for their onscreen chemistry in the movie <em>Vacancy</em> in 2007, Beckinsale and Wilson got on really well in front of the camera.</p> <p>However, they pretty much hated working alongside each other. Beckinsale claimed that Wilson had a ‘diva behavior’ about him that was getting out of hand. Once, he reportedly turned up hungover on the set and started bragging about all the girls he had been with over the weekend. This was the red flag for Beckinsale, who clearly never wants to work with her former co-star again.</p> <h2>#7: Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-748.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>Two very good actors, Witherspoon and Vaughn have made us laugh over the past decade or so. Their immense onscreen abilities make for great entertainment. However, when both of them worked together, things did not get on quite as well as one would think they did.</p> <p>It wasn’t an out-and-out hatred, but just a clash of personalities. Vaughn is more of the easygoing type who makes his scenes up on spot. He improvises and takes things easy. Witherspoon, however, prepares and plans everything as she goes and calculates every scene she does. Soon enough, the pair started having arguments about schedules, planning, and acting methods. They once shared the screen together in <em>Four Christmases</em> in 2008, but will most probably not be seen working together again.</p> <h2>#6: Alec Baldwin and Shia LaBeouf</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-749.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>Shia LaBeouf started off as a cute little boy on Family Chanel. We even remember him from the first Transformers movie.</p> <p>However, it did not take him long to establish the apparently coveted ‘bad boy’ image. His ways and methods proved to be quite the handful for Alec Baldwin, and this made it difficult for the pair to act together in <em>Orphans.</em> LaBeouf was not the only problem, though. Baldwin showed increased unprofessionalism and failed to rehearse his lines many times.</p> <p>In a meeting with the production company, LaBeouf said that he was being slowed down and made fun of Baldwin’s acting methods. The feud fueled up so much that one of them had to be fired from the show. Unsurprisingly enough, it was LaBeouf who was shown the door.</p> <p>This incompatibility will make sure the pair are never seen together on screen again.</p> <h2>#5: Martin Lawrence and Tisha Campbell</h2> <p> </p> <p><img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-750.jpeg"/></p> Wikimedia <p>Martin Lawrence and Tisha Campbell are two actors who never want to work together again. The pair got along quite well while shooting for the 90’s sitcom called <em>Martin</em>, however, this was not true in real life.</p> <p>Apparently, both of them were lovebirds before any feud began. They were in a relationship, which ended when Campbell chose to return to her previous boyfriend. Things got worse for Lawrence, crazily in love with Campbell, when she got engaged to her boyfriend. This led to jealousy, feuds, lawsuits, and eventually, broken bonds.</p> <h2>#4: Jennifer Aniston and Leslie Mann</h2> <p> </p> <p><img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-751.jpeg"/></p> Wikimedia <p>Two of the most famous sweethearts from Hollywood, Aniston and Mann are two stars who have made us laugh as well as cry. Both of them are incredibly versatile actresses who know no impossible.</p> <p>However, they do not get along very well. After working in the 1996 movie <em>She’s the One</em>, the pair never shared the screen again. It has gotten so bad that even though Aniston would like working in Judd Apatow’s movies, she does not approve of any offer out of fear of being cast alongside his wife, Mann. Apparently, she called her the ‘wife from hell.’</p> <p>It is a shame that two such brilliant actresses would not want to work together. Ah, well!</p> <h2>#3: Freddie Prinze Jr. and Kiefer Sutherland</h2> <p> </p> <p><img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-752.jpeg"/></p> Wikimedia <p>Freddie Prinze Jr. and Kiefer Sutherland worked together in the 2010 FOX series called <em>24.</em> There, they worked together and absolutely hated the experience. Prinze says of Sutherland that he is ‘the most unprofessional dude in the world.’</p> <p>What is worse is that Prinze, because of his annoyance, considered quitting his career. However, after returning to the spotlight, he made it clear that he was never working with Sutherland again. Ironically, Sutherland had nothing but the nicest things to say about Freddie.</p> <h2>#2: Lucy Liu and Bill Murray</h2> <p> </p> <p><img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-753.jpeg"/></p> Wikimedia <p>For the second installment of <em>Charlie’s Angels</em>, Bill Murray was replaced by Bernie Mac.</p> <p>The reason behind this is unknown, but there is a strong belief that this ensued because of Liu and Murray’s relationship. Murray, who did not like the script in the first place, found it hard to get by with Liu. They even had a huge quarrel on the set and Murray criticized her acting.</p> <p>Once, he ever stopped her while filming and questioned her methods. She became hostile towards him as a result and now, they will never be seen together again.</p> <h2>#1: Jamie Foxx and LL Cool J</h2> <p> </p> <p><img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-754.jpeg"/></p> Wikimedia <p>The feud between Jamie Foxx and LL Cool J was one that turned physical. The pair acted together in the 1999 movie <em>Any Given Sunday</em>, which was the last movie you will ever see them together in.</p> <p>The movie, based on football, had a lot of fight scenes. Apparently, LL Cool J and Foxx started becoming aggressive. LL Cool J was being so violent that Jamie Foxx had to ask for a signal beforehand. However, LL Cool J did not stop, hurling a punch in Foxx’s direction. This resulted in the two being engaged in a physical fight, ensuring they would never work together again.</p> <h2></h2>     <p>We hope you enjoyed our list of actors who do not get along with each other.
