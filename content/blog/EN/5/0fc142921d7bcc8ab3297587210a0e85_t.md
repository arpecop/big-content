These aspects of movie theatres seem to be universal no matter which cinema you go to.</p> <p>It may enhance your movie theatre experience to know certain facts that the people working there won’t tell you. Then again, this knowledge may make you never want to step foot in another movie theatre again. So, read about them below at your own risk. Don’t worry we aren’t talking about a spooky ghost fest here!</p> <h2>14: That Heavenly Popcorn Smell is a trap</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-667.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It’s not just a coincidence that this popcorn smell is the signature of almost every movie theatre.</p> <p>We must admit the popcorns in a movie theatre smell and taste out of this world! That tantalizing smell has us running for the lines at the refreshment stall even if we’re late for our movie.</p> <p>There isn’t just butter in your popcorn, but also fragrant additives. If you’re lucky, this additive could be something like coconut oil or canola oil. Of course, not everyone’s THAT lucky…for the sake of convenience and economy, many theatres also use synthetic additives.</p> <h2>13: Snacks prices are unreasonably overpriced</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-668.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The real profits for movie theatres are made in the concession stands. That’s exactly why they don’t allow or severely discourage any outside refreshments. They want you to buy the overly priced nachos, pizzas, popcorn, and drinks from the theatre. And buy them you will, because what a movie is without snacks, right?</p> <p>The snacks themselves are not of gourmet quality, nor do they cost a lot to make. That doesn’t stop the theatre owners from making a profit though. The prices are extremely inflated, making sure that at least one flow of income is permanent.</p> <h2>12: Movies Don’t Make Them the Most Money</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-669.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Yes. It’s true. That expensive ticket you bought doesn’t really turn into a profit for the theatre itself. It costs a lot to maintain and screen movies on such a huge scale every day. It would be hard for cinema owners to make money from just plain ol’ screenings. In fact, the only time movies make them profit are in the first month or so after a movie comes out, that’s it.</p> <p>A huge chunk of the profit is actually received by the studio that released the movie. When a movie has been playing for three months or more, only then the theatres stand to make a large profit.</p> <h2>11: Popcorn is not necessarily sold fresh</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-670.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Employees may scoop up warm popcorn into the tub right in front of you but that does not guarantee freshness. It is one of the greatest lies theatre owners have made you believe. There’s probably stale popcorn mixed right into the fresh kernels.</p> <p>Movie theatre employees themselves say that popcorns can last long. This may be why popcorn is the go-to snack for cinemagoers, not chips or tater tots. Almost any other kind of food would go off very quickly, tattling to the eaters and starting a riot.</p> <p>So, the movie theatre workers pack up whatever popcorn’s left over at the end of the night. The next day, they would put them in plastic bags/containers, then simply heat it up and start selling it again.</p> <h2>10: Theatre Workers Want You To Place The Trash On Your Seat, Not Under It</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-671.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The next time you’re in a movie theatre, look under the seats. Only do this, however, if you have a strong stomach. Movie theatre employees often simply sweep extra food under the seats. You can usually find a whole lot of popcorn and other leftovers there, probably crawling with ants.</p> <p>Fortunately, we can all do our part in keeping movie theatres cleaner. We can leave our trash on our seats instead of throwing it on the floor. This would make it easier for employees to pick up the trash when they clear the seats. Of course, we can always take it with you and bin it properly.</p> <h2>9: Movie Theatre Volumes are Horrible for Your Ears:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-672.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>That should not be a surprise. When it comes to volume, there are standards, regulations, and requirements every movie theatre is required to follow. However, theatres seldom follow them. Bomb, battles, shouts, screams, and gunshots can reduce your eardrums to a pulp. Your ears and hearing are two very precious things. Don’t lose them over a few hours of mindless fun.</p>     <h2>8: Employees Don’t Care if You Sneak In:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-673.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Of course, habitual freebies are not encouraged, but if you’re in for some occasional freeloading then rejoice! Since it doesn’t really make much of a difference in the theatre’s profits, an occasional sneak in does not bother the theatre owners.</p> <p>The movie screenings are really not the most reliable of profit-makers. So if a movie theatre employee sees you sneaking in, he/she probably wouldn’t bother to escort you out. It’s not worth the hassle.</p> <h2>7: The Timing is a Lie:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-674.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Regular cinemagoers would notice that even if they arrive late, they’re right on time. This is because there are several trailers and commercials before the actual show. This is why movie theatres call you in so early.</p> <p>So the next time you’re running late, don’t get stressed or yell at your companions. You’re probably missing out on the useless stuff where you’d do little but eat all that junk popcorn, anyway!</p> <p>An interesting point here is that movies may start way after the given time, but end right on the dot. This is so that ushers could stick to their cleaning schedules. Or whatever their definition of cleaning is!</p> <h2>6: No Cupholders before 1981:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-675.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It’s rather weird to know that there were no Cupholders in cinemas until 1981. One can’t imagine fixing that large cup between the knees but in reality, the cupholders were invented in 1981 which made a unique appearance in Cinemas shortly.</p> <p>A great invention, though!</p> <h2>5: Avoid Combo Meals, They Will Not Save You Money:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-676.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Every movie theatre concession stand would try to get their customers interested in combo meals. If you do end up getting one, however, it’s rarely a bargain. You can end up paying just as much or maybe only a few cents less than their separate price.</p> <p>Plus, a combo meal would probably give you items you wouldn’t have ordered in the first place. This way, you would end up eating more and paying more. It’s thriftier to go down a size rather than getting the extra things with a combo meal.</p> <h2>4: Best time to show up is in the morning</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-677.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Yes, in most theatres it is! The morning prices are the cheapest of all day – as low as $6.00. That’s not the only catch. With less people, you don’t have to wait in the long ques. You are also less likely to encounter noisy people with more empty seats in the theatre.</p> <h2>3: Understaffing is a genuine issue</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-678.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Theatre staff can occasionally get understaffed, mostly during seasonal changes when people tend to get sick. Understaff can result in delayed services, and this is when you need to deal with patience, because the staff tries their best that you don’t have to wait long in the ticket ques.</p> <h2>2: If you bring food, don’t forget to hide it</h2> <p><img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-679.jpeg"/></p> <p>Shutterstock</p> <p>The theatre staff knows when you bring outside food, but they choose to ignore it in most cases. If you’re bring candy and a bottle of water, that’s fine, but let’s not just go over the board. Please don’t bring the entire dinner buffet with you! If you are going to bring a large pizza, the staff will have to request you to eat it outside. Turns out, the theatre staff hate it when they have to ask people to eat outside, but remember it’s their job!</p> <h2>1: Theatre staff hates it when it’s too slow</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-680.jpeg"/>Shutterstock     <p>Believe it or not, but for many theatre staff it’s more like a love-hate situation. When it gets really busy, they long for in between breaks. But when things get really slow, they easily get bored! Why? Because they have nothing else to do. One staff member said she one spent time applying snap chat filters to actors faces on movie posters because she had nothing else to do! When it’s busier, time flies.</p>   <i></i>
