People will always be craving for unscripted real-life events that happening to total strangers and now celebrity stars too. Full of drama, emotions, and entertainment, the reality shows are now a regular part of our lives.</p> <p>16 and Pregnant were launched under the umbrella of MTV channel. It aired from 11thÂ of June 2009 until 1stÂ of July 2014. Just like other reality shows, 16 and Pregnant revolved around real Junos who got pregnant when they were just in high school. The show featured one girl in each episode usually beginning from her 8th-monthÂ pregnancy and ended after the baby was a few months old. It showed the hardship she faced during her teenage pregnancy.</p> <p>The show is still debated to be a promotion to the practice of safe sex or just controversial glamorizing. But three spin-offs followed the show which was Teen Mom, Teen Mom 2, and Teen Mom 3.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-72.gif"/>@GIPHY <h2>5.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Jenelle Evans</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-73.gif"/>@GIPHY <p>Jenelle Evans was featured in 16 and Pregnant and after that in Teen Mom 2 but nothing changed for her after both the shows. You can say it got even worse. Life was not easy for her even before the pregnancy. She had a father who was never there for her plus she had bad experiences with many boyfriends. She mentioned that in her memoir, Read between the lines. She turned towards drugs for comfort. She soon turned into a heroin addict that cost her the love for her family.</p> <p>Jenelle rejected her friends, her siblings and even her mother. The most devastating thing that happened to her was the retainment from seeing her own son. This tolled up her addiction towards drugs which helped her ease the pain. After a lot of pain and hurt, she finally turned towards rehabilitation. In her grim times, her mother came to her support.</p> <h2>4.Â  Kailyn Lowry</h2>      <p> Crafts with the kids was actually a fail tonight ðŸ˜‚ hair x @hairbytk ðŸ’• make up x @beautybykristenc</p> <p>A post shared by Kailyn Lowry (@kaillowry) on Dec 6, 2017 at 2:43pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Life for Kailyn Lowry has been a roller coaster ride.
