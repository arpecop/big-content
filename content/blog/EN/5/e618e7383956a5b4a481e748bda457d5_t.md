         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 0<p>Disney princesses have long been a popular urban fascination. The Disney animated movies are also getting a whole lot of attention from adults as well as kids. In fact, most Internet users today grew up on Disney movies and would watch any new releases. Interestingly, some ardent Disney fans can pinpoint some great connections between the movies.</p> <p>While we all may miss some Easter eggs, once you know about them, they’re impossible to miss. The whole trend of drawing connections between Disney princess movies is quite interesting. Even some directors and producers of the movies have confirmed certain facts. Read on below to discover more Disney magic!</p> <h2>The Frozen Parents Journey</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2276-zip-1.jpeg"/>Frozen / Walt Disney Animation Studios <p>The longest theory here needs to be split into a few pints. It all starts with a glimpse of the characters attending Elsa’s coronation in Frozen. Obviously, the guests contained important personalities from kingdoms near and far. Among them are Rapunzel and her husband Flynn Rider. These are the main characters in Tangled, the Disney animation based on Rapunzel.</p> <p>Hence, we can assume that the royal families of Arrendale and Corona know each other. They would also be on friendly terms if one attended such a special day in person.</p> <h2>The Unmentioned Sisters</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2276-zip-2.jpeg"/>Tangled/ Walt Disney Animated Studio <p>The theory only gets more detailed from here on out. Rapunzel and Elsa’s mothers do have a certain resemblance. They could very well not be just friends, but sisters! Or cousins, at least. It’s no surprise then that they are married to kings and have respective kingdoms of their own.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2276-zip-3.jpeg"/>Tangled/ Walt Disney Animated Studio <p>This would also explain the fact that their kids are born with magical powers. One daughter has the power to make ice and snow, while another can use her hair for healing purposes. When Rapunzel was finally recovered, the King and Queen of Arrendale must have gone to congratulate their friends/relatives. They also needed to attend the wedding, right? This is probably the important journey they were on when they left in the beginning of Frozen.</p> <p>The popular movie doesn’t actually tell us where Elsa and Anna’s parents were headed. They would obviously not have left their frightened daughter without some very important reason. What reason could there be unless it’s the return of another princess?</p> <h2>Geography Comes in Handy</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2276-zip-4.jpeg"/>Frozen / Walt Disney Animation Studios <p>You don’t have to be a geography expert to figure this one out. It may come in handy, though. The King and Queen of Arrendale hailed from Norway. The castle in Corona is based on 18th-century German architecture. Hence, it’s very likely that the doomed parents sailed between these countries. Germany was also where the Brothers Grimm penned the story of Rapunzel.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2276-zip-4-1.jpeg"/>Little Mermaid / Walt Disney <p>So the ship got wrecked and sunk in the North Sea. In all probability, it was near the coast of Denmark. Hans Christian Anderson was a Danish writer. He writes The Little Mermaid. In a time-twisting and mind-blowing theory, Ariel’s shipwreck could very well be the same ship! The 1950 movie is still relevant, it seems.</p> <p>Of course, Ariel lived in a somewhat tropical sea with the corresponding fish life. However, the theory still holds because we don’t know how far the ship can go before it sinks.</p> <h2>A Brother to Two Sisters</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2276-zip-5.jpeg"/>Tarzan, Walt Disney <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2276-zip-5-1.jpeg"/>Frozen / Walt Disney Animation Studios <p>The most exciting part of the theory starts her, though. It’s exciting because the directors of Frozen have actually confirmed this. They said that the Arrendale parents didn’t die during the shipwreck, but managed to get to a jungle. They built a treehouse there and had yet another child. Chris Buck confirmed this and said that the ship was blown away from Scandinavia completely.</p> <p>As a result, the parents lived in a tropical environment. Their son, however, was soon orphaned when they were eaten by a leopard. Since Chris Buck directed Tarzan as well, we believe him when he says this kid was him. So basically, Tarzan is Elsa and Anna’s brother!</p> <h2>The King on the Ship</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2276-zip-6.jpeg"/>Cinderella / Walt Disney <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2276-zip-6-1.jpeg"/>Little Mermaid / Walt Disney <p>The Frozen-Tangled-Tarzan theory is a bit exhausting. Let’s come back to a couple of classics. The Little Mermaid and Cinderella are no doubt two of the most popular in their genre. Plus, there is strong evidence that the royal families in these two worlds are definitely connected.</p> <p>When the villain Ursula changes into a young girl, she tries to get Prince Eric to marry her. Having stolen Ariel’s voice, it’s easy to make him think that she’s the one who saved him. At the wedding that never went through, though, there were two interesting guests. Namely, the King and Grand Duke from Cinderella!</p> <h2>More Wedding Attendees</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2276-zip-7.jpeg"/>Frozen / Walt Disney Animation Studios <p>Wedding guests are probably the most popular cameo for the people at Disney. The Frozen directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee confirm that the Arrendale King and Queen were going to a wedding. However, they did not mention which wedding it was.</p> <p>According to the many famous guests when the gates were opened in Frozen, this could have been any wedding. We previously discussed that it may be Rapunzel and Flynn’s ceremony. It could also have been Tiana’s wedding with Prince Naveen. If we go back far enough, it could even be Cinderella with her Prince Charming. All these characters were in attendance for the coronation. Even Aurora was glimpsed in a few frames!</p>     <h2>Moana and Ariel</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2276-zip-8.jpeg"/>Little Mermaid / Walt Disney <p>Moana is a recent release, but the team working on it was the same as the Classic Disney movies. Hence, a few connections and Easter eggs are in order!</p> <p>Many fans have noted that Moana is The Little Mermaid’s opposite. Ariel wanted to escape the sea and live on land. Moana was actively repented from exploring the sea. All she wanted, however, was a chance to prove herself here. Both ladies were kept where they were deemed safe by their families.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2276-zip-8-1.jpeg"/>Moana / Walt Disney <p>Nevertheless, both characters do mane to get away and live the life they dreamed of. The connections between their words also include a subtle one. When the villain-turned-hero Maui was singing his own phrases, little Flounder made an appearance! This little yellow and blue guy had been a favorite of The Little Mermaid fans for a long time.</p> <h2>Tinkerbell and the Black Cauldron</h2> <p><img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2276-zip-9.jpeg"/>The Black Claudron / Walt Disney</p> <p>The Black Cauldron is admittedly not the most famous of Disney movies. It wasn’t a huge success like The Lion King. However, animators still felt it had to have a cameo appearance by a popular Peter Pan character.</p> <p>Basically, the people in this animation get trapped in a cave. These include the Princess Eilonwy, Taran, and their friends. The fairy children come out to look at them. These fair folk eventually help the whole gang to get free of their predicament.</p> <p>When they do get free, the fairies are all over the screen. Among the fairies is one very familiar figure and color. That’s right, our Tinkerbell was right there! A blink of an eye, and you’d have missed it!</p> <h2>Ariel’s Mom and Captain Hook</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2276-zip-1-1.jpeg"/>Little Mermaid / Walt Disney <p>Ariel and Peter Pan both live in magical worlds. However, the two may be connected in more ways than the casual viewer may think. Ariel’s mother, as we know, was killed by some pirates. And who is a more famous pirate than Captain Hook?</p> <p>While Captain Hook becomes a good guy in the series Once Upon a Time, he’s evil in the Disney world. It is absolutely possible that Ariel’s mother Athena was one of his victims.</p> <p>This theory is further solidified by a certain mermaid in Peter Pan’s lagoon. She has an emerald-green tail and red hair. This is an uncanny resemblance to Ariel. Since the directors of both movies were more or less the same, this is not too fantastic a theory. Plus, Ariel has a fantastic wonderland under the sea. It may just be connected to Peter Pan’s lagoon.</p> <h2>Jane Porter</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2276-zip-1-2.jpeg"/>Beauty and the Beast / Walt Disney <p>For those who’ve forgotten, Jane Porter is Tarzan’s better half. She came to the jungle of an exploring expedition but soon found love in a strange wild man. Sound familiar?</p> <p>There is more than one connection between Beauty and the Beast and Tarzan. When the gorilla is playing around in Jane’s tent, we can see a tea set in front of him. That tea set should be familiar to all Disney fan. It’s actually the one that Mrs. Potts and her family were.</p> <p>The theory goes that once the curse was lifted, the people trained. However, the original items remained intact. Jane is probably a descendent of Belle’s, likely her great-great-granddaughter. Hence, she inherited the tea set. The question of why she brought it into the jungle still remains, though.</p> <p>This theory also holds up when you think about how Jane communicated with Tarzan. Her ancestor Belle had the same talent when she handled the Beast. Plus, Belle and Jane have quite a family resemblance.</p> <h2>Belle’s favorite book</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2276-zip-1-3.jpeg"/>Beauty and the Beast / Walt Disney <p>The recent live-action movie for this popular cartoon was very well-received. However, it is worthwhile if you pay attention to the song Belle sings in the very beginning. It’s both a prediction and a very interesting connection!</p> <p>Belle sings about a land far away, with magical spells. This could be any Disney movie, but she also mentions ‘daring swordfights’ and a ‘prince in disguise’. This is probably Aladdin, which was only realized once the movie came out.</p> <p>What’s more, she also talks about the girl not knowing about her prince until later. All of this connects with and adds up to Aladdin’s story perfectly!</p> <h2>Ariel and Hercules</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2276-zip-1-4.jpeg"/>Little Mermaid / Walt Disney <p>There’s nothing like a good old family connection. While Hercules isn’t a princess, he is a prince of sorts. After all, he is the son of Zeus, the ruler of the Greek gods.</p> <p>However, Zeus also had siblings. Poseidon was his brother, according to Greek mythology. While Zeus was the god of thunder and anything to do with the sky, Poseidon had the sea. And Triton, the Disney mermaid Ariel’s father, was Poseidon’s son.</p> <p>This makes Hercules and Triton direct first cousins. As a result, Hercules is related to the princess Ariel. They are also first cousins, once removed. Who would have thought it possible?</p> <h2>The Blonde Factor</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2276-zip-1-5.jpeg"/>Tangled/ Walt Disney Animated Studio <p>If we are to believe that Elsa and Rapunzel are related, there are quite a few theories backing you up. One is detailed above, with their mothers’ resemblance. Rapunzel’s mother could also be Elsa’s father’s sister as they both have green eyes.</p> <p>However, Elsa and Anna are also both blonde and magical. The color of their hair may have more significance than we may think. In fact, it could be the reason for both powers.</p> <p>Both Elsa and Rapunzel were born with their magical abilities. Of course, Rapunzel’s was a bit temporary, while Elsa’s was much more powerful and long-lasting.</p> <p>It’s not a far reach of we say that in this royal family, blonde hair equals magical properties. This may be a family gene carried throughout generations. Otherwise, why would Elsa have such powers? This was never explained in the movie. It’s quite a burning question because everyone else in the movie seems ordinary.</p> <p>Interestingly, Rapunzel’s hair goes brown when it’s cut. This is because the magic ceases within it. Elsa, however, does not seem to possess that sort of temporary power. We’re glad she doesn’t because this princess is one of the well-loved among younger generations!</p> <h2>Conceal, Don’t Feel</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-temp1_2276-zip-1-6.jpeg"/>Frozen / Walt Disney Animation Studios <p>It usually irks viewers to fins Elsa’s parents forcing her to control her magic. They certainly don’t do a very good job of it. Very likely, they are afraid of magic and fear that their child would suffer from it. There is probably also a precedent for them to feel this way.</p> <p>If they are related to Rapunzel, they would be scared of losing their daughter in the same way. Rapunzel was probably only found when the King and Queen set out on their journey. This would make them very worried for Rapunzel when Elsa and Anna were growing up. The strictness and concealing methods make a lot more sense this way.</p>     <p>Disney sure does spur on our imagination. The connection between these popular movies and characters shows how much imagination their staff has too. Hopefully, Disney would work on these connections a little more and give us some brilliant crossover films in the future!</p>   <i></i>
