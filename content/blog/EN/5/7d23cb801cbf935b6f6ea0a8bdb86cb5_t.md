Halloween, the night out of nightmares, but joyous for kids and adults alike, is upon us once again. The holiday is riddled with trick-or-treaters, crazy costumes and awesome parties. It is, however, incomplete without your very own, hand carved Jack-o’-lanterns. This year, we bring you an exclusive list with all the best of Jack-o’-lanterns that the internet has to offer. See something you like? Pick up that knife and get carvin’!</p> <h2>The nightmare within a nightmare</h2>      <p> Did good for my first pumpkin ever carved 😎 #holloween #jackolantern #pumpkincarving</p> <p>A post shared by Francois Griggs-Ross (@thatguy_franky) on Oct 16, 2017 at 11:37pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <h2>Is that the Cheshire cat I see?</h2>      <p> Got to carve pumpkins today 😀 #pumpkincarving #holloween #swirl #fun #cute #pumpkin</p> <p>A post shared by Jessie Estrada (@moon.hex) on Oct 16, 2017 at 11:30pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <h2>Who doesn’t love this guy?</h2>      <p> #メリオダス 2014年作品 #パンプキンカービング #ハロウィン #pumpkincarving #pumpkin #halloween #七つの大罪</p> <p>A post shared by Pumpkin's Takumi pair (@pumpkins_2takumi) on Sep 26, 2017 at 5:06am PDT</p>   <p></p> <h2>This pumpkin has no chill.</h2>      <p> Only a few more days until October!

One way to tell that is by looking at the stem. If the stem is green and firmly attached to the fruit then it is a fresh one. Check the bottom. If it feels mushy, pick a new one. Always pick a pumpkin according to the design you have in mind. If you are going to carve a vertical design, then picking a tall pumpkin would be best. With tall fruits, make sure the base is wide enough for it to stand stable while you carve. Feel the surface with your hand. Smoother pumpkins are easier to carve out.  <h2>The demon, the witch or the cat?</h2>      <p> Who wins?

Keep a scoop handy for removing seeds and pulp. Chef knives can also prove efficient as they can easily be used for doing detailed, intricate work. You can also find special tools meant for carving pumpkins online. A smock and sheet would also help contain the mess. Especially if you are an amateur. Like moi. Whichever knives and tools you pick, make sure they are sharp enough to get the job done. Understandably, you should always keep these knives out of kid’s reach. Or if you have kids who want to help out, here are some kids’ friendly tools. Another must-have piece of equipment is… toothpicks! These help you attach any piece you might have cut by mistake. My first Halloween pumpkin was more toothpicks and less pumpkin, true story.  <h2>Winter is coming, you foolish summer child.</h2>      <p> Happy Halloween! 🎃 Thought I'd try the new style carving… the effect is fab! #halloween #pumpkin #pumpkincarving #jackolantern #gameofthrones #gameofthronespumpkin #gothalloween #housestark #winteriscoming #direwolf #asongoficeandfire #spooky #orange #fall #autumn #trickortreat #nofilter</p> <p>A post shared by Becky Boon (@becks_boon) on Oct 31, 2016 at 4:10pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <h2>I’m your father!</h2>  <p>The Rebels won’t be able to steal the Death Star plans from this dark gourd Vader! #rogueone #darthvader #pumpkincarving #zombiepumpkins pic.twitter.com/bRSWzX4n0r</p> <p>— Zombie Pumpkins!

It also gives you a clean surface to work on. Begin by cutting out the bottom. That way the base becomes steadier. Pumpkin masters suggest carving an octagon in the base rather than a circle as it would make the base more steady. Cutting out the bottom also makes lighting the pumpkin easier. Rather than lowering a light into it, place it over one. Tadaa! Scoop the insides out *Halloween pun intended*. Shave the side you plan to carve on from the inside, a thinner surface is easier to work on and helps you get the intricacies right. If you are using a stencil, tape it firmly to the pumpkin and trace it. Light the pumpkin to see what it looks like and work on the details until it looks like the way you want it to.  <h2>Please excuse me while I go bawl my eyes out.</h2>      <p> Always… #harrypotter #harrypotterpumpkin #harrypotterpumpkins #harrypotterart #always #deathlyhallows #harrypotterstudios #hp #pumpkins #harrypotternerd #harrypotterquoted #harrypotterforever #hogwarts #instaart #inspired #pumpkincarving #potterhead</p> <p>A post shared by Daniel Nash (@danielnash_7) on Oct 21, 2015 at 1:10pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <h2>Someone lose a cat?</h2>      <p> More carvings! #lorispumpkins #pumpkin #halloween</p> <p>A post shared by Lorelai.Marie (@neonbendystraw) on Oct 27, 2014 at 9:54pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <h2>Where do I pay for this?</h2>      <p> Moth pumpkin carving DIY via Martha Stewart . . . #pumpkin #pumpkincarving #moth #halloween #fall #autumn #halloweendiy #gothichomedecor #witch #witchy #blackmagic #blackmagickingdom</p> <p>A post shared by KMS x Black Magic (@kmsxblackmagic) on Sep 24, 2017 at 10:09am PDT</p>   <p></p> <h2>I am not sure if my kids would even let me touch this.</h2>      <p> It’s that time of season again! #pumpkincarving #halloween #dragonballz #dragonball</p> <p>A post shared by Phillip Pham-Ho (@instapham.h) on Sep 24, 2017 at 6:53am PDT</p>   <p></p> <h2>Check your gardens, people.

You can also soak it in a tub of water overnight and add bleach to prevent mold. You could also use Vaseline or other oil based jelly products to seal in the moisture. Rubbing some vegetable or olive oil will keep your pumpkin looking glossy!  <h2>My heart bleeds. Somebody?

Show them any rotting or soft points that should be avoided and help them pick one according to the tips above. Choose an easy design and don’t rush the carving process. Use small and slow motions. Always carve yourself and keep the kids occupied by walking you through the design or prepping decorative stuff like glitter, stickers, badges etc. Lay down a sheet or newspaper to reduce the mess. It is very easy to slip on some pulp and fall. Clean up quickly. Kids or no kids, we suggest you skip the candles altogether as they can be a potential fire hazard. Use LED candles or tea lights.  <h2>Their pumpkin game is stronger than mine ever would be.</h2>  <p>More pumpkins are lit. #jackolantern #Halloween patterns from @ZombiePumpkins pic.twitter.com/QXwSQxjSrZ</p> <p>— Edward Woods (@WoodsEdward) October 7, 2017</p> <p></p> <h2>Say my name!</h2>      <p> I AM the pumpkin. #breakingbad #walterwhite #breakingbadpumpkin #amc</p> <p>A post shared by Ryan M.
