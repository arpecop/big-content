Any particular event coming along in which you just have to look perfect and toned? Dresses becoming tighter in the wrong areas? Getting frustrated that the old hacks are not making the problem go away? Well we have news for you! Your belly fat will not go away overnight but you have to start somewhere no? It sounds difficult right now but altering a few eating habits in your day to day life has the ability to make your belly fat go away forever. At least as long as you try to maintain it.</p> <p>Here is a list of foods you should stay away from:</p> <h2>Avoid Alcohol:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1858.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Did you know there is a part of your brain that is responsible to make you feel full? Well now you know. Drinking alcohol can confuse this part of your brain and make you feel hungrier, which in turn would lead to you overeat. This explains the reason behind the bowl of nuts the bartender keeps on the counters when serving alcohol. Another reason alcohol is bad because of the calories present in alcohol play a big factor in adding to your belly fat too.</p> <h2>Say no to Soft drinks:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1860.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>We all know added sugar can be very unhealthy. Which is exactly what these drinks contain. Not only do these drinks have 0 nutritional benefit, they also add to your abdominal fat. These drinks also have a tendency to slow down your metabolic rate and the fructose overload in the liver can lead to insulin resistance. Bad habits are bad for a reason.</p> <h2>Chewing gum isn’t helping you:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1863.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Some people think chewing gum is a healthy replacement for food. Getting to chew all you want and letting your body absorb no fat. Well we have bad news for you, whilst you are chewing gum your brain sends constant messages or signals to your stomach warning it about the incoming food when there is none. This makes your stomach produce more acid to burn the food your body is supposedly being fed and it will in turn make you feel hungrier leaving no guarantee as to what you will end up eating. This could especially be unhealthy if you keep having one meal after another because your brain is convinced you need more and more food in your body thanks to your gum chewing habit.</p> <h2>The Saltier the unhealthier:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1865.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>The least likeable thing about food with high sodium levels is the effect it has on one’s blood pressure. Not only does it suck all the water from your body which in turn prevents you from losing the excessive fat making your abdominal area stand out. Hence adopting a low sodium diet is the way to go for a healthier lifestyle. Wouldn’t want sugar to feel bullied now would we?</p> <h2>Fast food or fat food:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1867.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>This one was predictable enough. No one needs to have a meal that’s worth almost more than 2000 calories, that’s low on the nutritious side and high on the sodium side. If you have ever noticed a calorie counter it usually allows you a specific number of calories during the day. These calories (per day) range from 1200 to 1500 which could be your one unhealthy and greasy meal of burgers, fries and a soft drink (add a cone to the side and make this unhealthier). Whilst consuming fast food one needs to weigh the pros and cons and realize if it really is even worth it. Sure treating yourself every now and then isn’t as bad as having a meal from a fast food place every day. Hence our advice is you need to start somewhere. Cut down on the calories you really don’t need in your life and prevent the few extra inches on your belly.</p> <h2>Be selective of your sauces:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1869.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>We aren’t recommending leaving all the sauces you enjoy with your food. Our advice to you is to leave sauces that have a chance of going down to your stomach and storing itself as fat there. This does not mean there aren’t delicious and healthier sauces that exist there. Here are some less calorie but nutritious and delicious sauces: Salsa, Hummus, Pesto, Chutney, Wasabi, Guacamole, Mustard, Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco sauce. The sauces that you should definitely cut out of your diet are Mayonnaise, Barbeque sauce and ketchup. At the end of the day there are different brands coming out with low calorie versions of the forbidden sauces as well so it really isn’t that hard to be selective about your sauces.</p> <h2>Cut your carbs:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1871.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Carbs are the largest food group in our diet that we need to be extremely cautious about. People habitually live a lifestyle that requires a lot of consumption of carbs due to the factual evidence of it being a good source of energy. There are good carbs and there are bad carbs. This difference can be easily determined by the size to their water capacity ratio. Hence it is necessary to be able to tell the difference between good carbs and bad carbs and consume the ones that not only give us more energy and have a tendency to not stick completely to the fat in our abdomen.</p> <h2>No ‘I’ for Ice cream:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1872.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>This really is no shocker. Ice cream is part of two groups that combine to make your abdomen bigger. Being rich with sugar and dairy this shows that the ice cream plays a huge part in adding fat to your belly and cutting it from your diet is the best way to lose the fat that’s not letting you look pretty or fit in your favorite dress. Sugar is something that’s hard to cut from your diet especially when served in the form of yummy beverages like ice cream itself but motivate yourself to cut these things of so you don’t have to live with obesity for the rest of your life.</p> <h2>Row away from Raw food:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1873.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>All our lives we have grown up hearing how fresh food and vegetables are healthy. Well raw fruit and vegetables take up more volume then cooked food in your stomachs making your stomach jut out and look larger than its average size. A good idea is to cook the produce to make a serving that takes up less volume in your stomach and doesn’t make it look like a separate person attached to your body.</p>     <h2>Drown the Dairy Products:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1874.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>We all understand how dairy products are good for providing us calcium, but they provide us with other things such as carbs and fat that we absolutely do not need in our diet. Another reason dairy products like milk and cheese are bad because of the hardship our gut has to face in order to digest it. Our gut faces this due to the lack of production of the lactase enzyme in our body as we slowly progress in age. The main purpose of this enzyme is to ease babies into digesting breast milk which makes it lose its function in our body as we gradually grow older.</p> <h2>Things you should eat to maintain a healthy diet:</h2> <h3>Yogurt:</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1875.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Alimentary Pharmacology recently published an article about the benefits of eating probiotic yogurt. The publishers of this article believe that the digestive system might be slow due to an imbalance of bacteria in it. The bacteria in the yogurt on the other hand can finish this imbalance and help with better digestion which eases your bloated stomach. Yogurt can also be your best source of calcium from the dairy group as well.</p> <h3>Protein:</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1876.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Shown to reduce cravings by 60%, proteins are an important macronutrient that play an important part in losing weight. Not only do they boost your metabolism but help you consume less calories day by day. This doesn’t just help you lose weight but it effectively ensures you don’t gain it back either. Lentils, red meat, fish and eggs are good foods that contain healthy proteins.</p> <h3>Fluids:</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1877.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Drinking fluids such as water, milk, juice, coffee or tea act as a supporting agency for the rest of the nutrients you consumed to make your stomach flatter. Fluids in general are a vital part of your digestive system as they can do miracles like ease constipation by collaborating with other foods like fiber. It is healthy to drink 8 glasses of water a day to have good metabolism and a flatter stomach.</p> <h3>Fruit:</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1878.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Our previous point about fluids being important applies to some fruits as well. Fluid rich fruits such as oranges, watermelons and grapefruits are good for digestion and aid it. Not only this but fruits have traits that not only aid us in digestion but provide sufficient nutrients, good fiber and other health benefits for our bodies. Try having fruit for dessert or snack time rather than your traditional diabetes ridden chocolate cakes or candy. It is healthier.</p> <h3>Fiber:</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1879.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Try to add two types of fibers in your diet to help you with digestion. Another reason for abdominal fat or bloating could be constipation and what is the best way to combat that? By adding more fiber into your diets. Daily doses of fiber will result in a high metabolic rate which would in turn lead to a flatter belly. Try another kind of soluble fiber along with cereal to make your digestion smoother and faster.</p> <h3>Soup:</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1880.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Soup can be the yummiest part of your new lifestyle. You can go crazy making any type of soup you want (just not with too much cream) and just enjoy the deliciousness. Not is only soup very filling but it has a lesser amount of calories and a larger amount of nutrients in it. The liquid aspect of it especially clear broths have a tendency to aid you in digestion as well as burn old fat.</p> <h2>Things you can do to lose some of that fat too</h2> <h1>Dancing:</h1> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1881.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Dancing is a fun way to keep yourself all toned up.
