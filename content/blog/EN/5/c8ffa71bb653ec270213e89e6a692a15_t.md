         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 3<p> </p> <p>We all have come across some sort of surveys and feedback forms at work, school, or university. Most of the time, they are answered in a pretty normal way, no big deal. However, an 11-year-old girl has recently set the internet on fire by answering a questionnaire in her own way. Young Ava, when questioned about what her teachers could do better in an end-of-the-year review, audaciously wrote that they should stop using collective punishment as a means to improve behavior in children.</p> <p>Why would a little girl write such a thing? Read below to find out!</p> <h2>Why would a little girl write that?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-697.jpeg"/>MasonCrossBooks / Twitter <p>11-year old Ava did not shy away from voicing her honest opinion in the questionnaire that was handed out to her. Her answers, particularly this one, were so well-thought out that her father, Mason Cross, was forced to post it on Twitter. He posted this picture along with a caption debating whether he should ground her or buy her ice cream for her witty response.</p> <p>Ava wrote that the reason collective punishment should not be given to children is that it is unfair to the people who are innocent, and also because it is a war crime under the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Yes, a little girl wrote that. You better believe it!</p> <p>As soon as her father shared a tweet about this, it instantly got over 160,000 shares and over half a million likes.</p> <h2>Is it true?</h2>  <p>Ava is okay with collective ice cream pic.twitter.com/ZfLkSEivEZ</p> <p>— Mason Cross (@MasonCrossBooks) July 2, 2017</p> <p></p> <p>As it turns out, the information that Ava has used to back her argument up is indeed true.</p> <p>Part III, Section I, Article 33 of the Geneva Conventions states that “no protected person may be punished for an offense he or she has not personally committed.”</p> <p>As smart as that is, you can never expect an 11-year-old to come up with such a brilliant response. The brutal honesty coupled with a mere fact has changed the perspective of people. There were no cliché answers in the questionnaire that Ava filled. Like a smart young lady, she was not afraid of voicing her opinion and suggesting how things could be improved around the school.</p> <p>We would say it is a brilliant piece of knowledge paired with a statement filled with audacity that has shown the world how smart of a person little Ava is. Did you know that when you were eleven?</p> <h2>Her father’s reaction.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-698.jpeg"/>MasonCrossBooks / Twitter <p>Upon reading his daughter’s answer, Mason Cross was a father in two minds.</p> <p>He could not understand whether to reward his daughter with an ice cream for her smartness or ground her for her audacity. In fact, he was so confused that he took to Twitter to ask people what he should do.</p> <p>However, Mason also went on to mention on the social media platform that Ava has no problems with her teacher; it’s the ‘educational justice system’ she disagrees with.</p> <p>The responses that followed were great.</p> <h2>Twitter reacts.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-699.jpeg"/>MasonCrossBooks / Twitter <p>When author Mason Cross took to Twitter to ask his followers what step he should take in light of his daughter’s confident move, he was met with a lot of responses.</p> <p>People started overflowing the tweet with tons of retweets.</p> <p>A lot of people were surprised and happy with Ava’s smartness and tried convincing Mason to buy her daughter the ice cream. People questioned as to why she would deserve to be grounded for giving feedback. One of them went to the extent of suggesting he buys her any flavor she wants for a whole year. A few even said they’d fund her ice cream!</p> <p>One person suggested she be the next president. Another gave her ‘bonus points for her excellent thinking.’</p> <p>Everyone was astounded by Ava’s smartness and her confidence to write such a bold statement. It is not something you would expect from your everyday 11-year-old kid. It really does seem like Ava is quite serious about having collective punishment abolished. And why shouldn’t she be? It is a war crime, after all.</p> <p>Her father said afterward that he loved the crazy response Ava’s smartness had gotten her. It was quite insane and he also said that he had not outsmarted her in an argument since she turned six. He also said that her teacher was quite surprised, too. It was extremely amusing to him.</p>     <p>Little did the teachers know they were committing such grave sins!</p> <h2>The verdict!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-700.jpeg"/>Twitter <p>The people from Twitter spoke in favor of Ava; so much that her father was convinced that he should get her the ice cream.</p> <p>As you can see in the picture, that is the face of a victorious child. She successfully outwitted her teachers and friends and earned her rightful award. She looks extremely happy and we can only imagine the kind of genius she will evolve into as the years pass.</p> <p>In fact, her father gave in to the Twitter responses and bought Ava not one, but two cones of ice cream. One of them also has a bar of chocolate hanging from it. Why not, though? She absolutely deserves it!</p> <h2>How can a little girl be so smart?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-701.jpeg"/>MasonCrossBooks / Twitter <p>An 11-year-old is never expected to be this smart. That brings us to the question, from where did little Ava acquire such a high level of knowledge?</p> <p>Her father, Mason Cross, is a writer of crime novels. He is the author Carter Blake, a critically acclaimed thriller series. This explains where little Ava might have got her knowledge from. It also shows how the family is one of creative thinkers. As we all know, children are naïve and impressionable. Especially at such a young age, Ava’s exposure to her father’s work must have rubbed off on her quite a lot.</p> <p>The results are there for everyone to see, and boy, are they impressive! The picture depicts Ava sitting with two other children we assume to be her siblings and the caption by her father reads: “Ava is okay with collective ice cream.”</p> <p>Hilarious, is it not? Collective punishment is something that is out of the question, but collective ice cream? Not at all!</p> <h2>Determination and perspectives.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-702.jpeg"/>MasonCrossBooks / Twitter <p>This example of Ava and her self-confidence and knowledge further goes to prove that we can do anything we put our minds to.</p> <p>Usually, you do not expect such a young girl to know such things and be so well informed. Children pick up stuff quickly, but this also goes to show that from a young age, we can do anything we put our heart into. Also, the way Ava tackled this question was pretty smart.</p> <p>Children have different perspectives. They look at life through their own tiny lens and try to solve problems accordingly. The fact that Ava would write such a thing in a school questionnaire is pretty amazing. It shows her way of thinking and the method in which she tackled the problem.</p> <p>It is so well thought out. It is an undeniable fact and the quality of the answer should be attributed to little Ava.</p> <h2>The Aftermath</h2> <p>Ava has managed to spark up a lot of interest because of her answer in that questionnaire.</p> <p>One of the responses from Twitter pointed out a good point, that even though Ava’s use of the Geneva Conventions was irrelevant in this context, she still managed to educate a lot of people about international laws. And, at a time of disagreement and conflict of human rights, this is exactly what the world needs more of.</p> <p>Another great effect it has had on the family is that Mason Cross’ novels have spiked up in sales. People are more curious and eager to read more about anyone related to Ava no matter what it might be. One British bookshop even went the distance by displaying his books along with his name that said “Mason Cross (Ava’s Dad).”</p> <p>If she’s turning out to be an asset at such a young age, one can only think of the miracles she will pull off once she is older.</p> <p>So let us get this clear; Ava accused her teacher of a war crime, and not for a second thought about the consequences of her actions. Given she did nothing wrong, this kind of confidence should be in every kid. And she is right. No child should be made to miss his or her lunch break for the wrongdoings of someone else. Fair and square!</p> <p>What we can learn from Ava’s story is that it is good, to be honest. Voicing your opinion and being confident is a right that everyone has; it is just the matter of time until we start exercising it. Also, sometimes we must look at things from a different perspective. Ava did just that, and the response she got was overwhelming.</p>     <p>Therefore, we must always put our heart and mind into the task we are doing and always be confident in our abilities! This way, we can be as smart as Ava. And famous, too.</p>   <i></i>
