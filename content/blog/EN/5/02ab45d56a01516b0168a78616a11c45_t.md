Wentworth Woodhouse</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1194.jpeg"/>ghk.h-cdn <p>The 17th Century Wentworth Woodhouse located in the English Town of Rotherham has one of the most scary ghost sight ever. The ghost hunter team heard footsteps around the old stable area and saw a spirit walking, but when they tried to chase it, it continued to walk ahead of them oblivious of the surroundings and disappeared. Initially it seemed like a set-up of the team but when they went to watch it closely the figure was completely transparent.</p> <h2>11. Hugo’s House of Horrors</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-14.png"/>wikipedia <p>So this YouTuber named Hugo Blog was casually walking along the mansion with his friends. The building was so crumpled that it seemed like it might just fall down any moment, but they managed to go inside the building and kept exploring until they saw the video of this girl who was trying to peep through the hole. Later they found out that there was a man who was found dead at this side in the year 2008. The victim ended up suffering a blunt force trauma to his head and face which later became the cause of his death. As per the investigation reports he was hit on the head with a piece of board. The twist to this story is that no one was able to find the murderer and it remains a mystery still.</p> <h2>10. Bus 166</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1195.jpeg"/>wikimedia <p>The old abandoned bus in the woods was found to be haunted. This bus was the unfortunate bus of which the school wanted to get rid of because of the fact that some child lost their life on the way back home. A ghost hunter managed to purchase the bus at a low price. One day he was making a video of it when suddenly he heard a peculiar noise saying “hello” which started to become more in frequency as he went closer to the bus. Since the man lives alone on his property and does not have any wife or children it is assumed that this was the voice of a girl inside the bus who has passed away but her soul is trapped in the bus. Thus she is trying to catch the attention of the man making the video thinking he can see her but in fact he cannot.</p> <h2>9. Mike Robins</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1196.jpeg"/>insidethemagic <p>The You Tuber Mike Robins ended up making a video of the paranormal investigations along with his friends. They are using a modified Kinect camera which is a special software to hunt ghosts while moving around the ghost sites. They ended up seeing this soul and tried to communicate with it but the soul did not seem to be in a mood to answer the questions or respond back. Also they noticed some movements of the ghost which could not be figured out whether he wants to hush them away or trying to wave at them. It was assumed that the ghost wanted to be left alone.</p> <h2>8. Blake Smiths</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1197.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>The Youtuber Blake Smith claimed on his channel about observing some paranormal activity in his basement. This included some peculiar noises as well. He asked his fans for suggestions as to how he can record it so they advised him to leave his phone in the basement and leave it open. The video he ended up making lasted for a minute and contained some really weird voices and effects which depicted the silhouette of a person. But it cannot be ascertained whether the video was fake or real but if it was fake getting such accurate effects would not have been possible.</p>     <h2>7. Barry can’t breathe</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1199.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>The team of ghost hunters visited the house in San Pedro California was suggested to be a haunted one for quite a long time. Supposedly the ghosts living there were quite adventurous! They wanted and enjoyed opening cupboards throw plates and change the television channels as well as linger in some rooms. The people who resided in the house ended up leaving it. Many others who tried to reside in there could never do that and also because red liquid dropped from the walls of this building many times. But the ghost investigators were determined to find out what was in there and sent one of their representatives one day when they heard some snapping voices. The investigator later returned to find out that something was tied around his neck and he also confessed that something tried to choke him upstairs with a chord also his glasses also went missing. They called of the investigation soon after that as this was endangering the lives of the investigators.</p> <h2>6.
