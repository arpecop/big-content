We mean Thaaat time of the month which arrives every month and leaves a bloody trail in its wake. Yes, periods. And all the hullabaloo and drama associated with it. Totally legit, we tell you. Something that destructive should be accompanied by all the fanfare but no, it does not have to be painful.</p> <p>Enter period cramps that almost always accompany Aunt Flo. They are like the twin sisters that nobody likes to see the two of yet they are inseparable. In fact, it is those painful cramps that usually herald the arrival of your periods. So what actually are they and why do they always have to make an appearance?</p> <p>According to Mayo Clinic, “menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea) are throbbing or cramping pains in the lower abdomen. Many women experience menstrual cramps just before and during their menstrual periods”. They go on to say that “during your menstrual period, your uterus contracts to help expel its lining.</p> <p>Hormone-like substances (prostaglandins) involved in pain and inflammation trigger the uterine muscle contractions. Higher levels of prostaglandins are associated with more-severe menstrual cramps”.</p> <p>So there you have it, and judging by this explanation, as long as you continue having periods, these cramps would surely make a monthly appearance in your life.</p> <h2>How to manage or minimize the pain?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1662.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>Now that we know that these buggers are not going anywhere, it is wise to explore some ways that the pain can be lessened or made bearable.
