With hundreds of young want-to-be actors and actresses traveling to the Land of Dreams, the competition is tough and exasperating. The lust for success can drive people to do some crazy things. It’s no wonder so many people go under the knife to preserve their youthful looks. But, it’s not always a success and the results can be traumatic to their career. Who thought a little nip and tuck here and there could turn out to be such a disaster!</p> <p>Well, obviously these celebrities didn’t! Everyone wants to look like a million dollars and some are willing to pay for it! But artificial youthful comes at a cost. I’m not just talking about the huge sums of cash celebrities spend on cosmetic surgery but rather the risk of altering your body! Who knows what you’re going to end up looking like! I’m clearly not going under the knife anytime soon.</p> <h2>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen</h2>      <p> – big smile – #olsentwins #marykate #ashley #marykateolsen #ashleyolsen #twins #cute #kids #90s</p> <p>A post shared by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (@olsentwins_fans) on Sep 30, 2017 at 11:49am PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> 14/05/2015 – MARY-KATE &amp; ASHLEY AT @sephora Image from: OlsensObsessive.Com . . . . #marykateolsen #marykateandashley #marykate #ashley #ashleyolsen #olsens #style #olsentwins #olsentwins #olsensisters #marykateandashleyolsen #theolsentwins #ofotd #fashion #fashionpost #fashiondiaries #lookoftheday #fashiongram #beauty #beautiful #star #clothes #celebrity #therow #elizabethandjames  #olsensobsessive #sephora</p> <p>A post shared by Mary-Kate &amp; Ashley Olsen (@marykateandashleyo) on Oct 4, 2017 at 3:18am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>It seems like the Olsen twins have been in show-biz all their life! The duo stole every heart in America when they appeared on Full House and continued to have even more success with every movie and book they released. You would think that such talented young girls would be happy with the way things are going, but the ugly truth is, there were rumors of anorexia floating around as the twins got older.</p> <p>They all decided to go under the knife and have some work done surprisingly to look different from one another! Today the twins are continuing with their success as fashion icons, producers, and authors. We wish both ladies a lot of success and pray we see them on the screen together again.</p> <h2>Michael Jackson</h2>      <p> It’s not #TBT, it’s #MJTBT! To kick things off, let's go back to 1983 with Michael's “Human Nature” single cover.</p> <p>A post shared by Michael Jackson (@michaeljackson) on May 15, 2014 at 9:12am PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> يقلبيييي كياتههههه …… . . . . . . #michaeljackson #michaeljacksonforever #michaeljacksonfan #mjlover #mjk #mjfam #mjjisbeautiful #mjfamily #mjkingofpopandmusicforever #mjfam #michaeljackson #mj @michaeljackson #saveneverland #smoothcriminal #mtvmjmarathon #مايكل_جاكسون #applehead.</p> <p>A post shared by i love you mj……💋 (@demaalihamee) on Oct 5, 2017 at 4:24am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>The King of Pop, although not here with us today, will always remain in our hearts. From as long as I can remember, Michael had blessed our screens with hits after hits. His iconic moves, angelic voice and infectious personality was a privilege to witness. But, it looks like all the fame and fortune came with some major insecurities. No one could really understand why Michael had all that work done especially when at times it seemed like his nose was missing. Another controversial matter was the question of his skin color changing from a gorgeous dark caramel to a pale white! Whatever the case, the ever so talented Michael Jackson died of a drug overdose at the age of 50 and left the world devastated.</p> <h2>Lindsay Lohan</h2>      <p> SPEAK. Lindsay Lohan. 2004 #Libros #LibrosEnVenta #VentaDeLibros #LibrosUsados #LindsayLohan #Musica</p> <p>A post shared by Dauphin Books (@dauphinbooks) on Oct 4, 2017 at 6:16pm PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> @lindsaylohan ❤️ #lindsaylohan #teamlohan #lilover #lilo</p> <p>A post shared by IS LIFE LOHAN ❤ (@lifelohan) on Oct 4, 2017 at 3:05pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Lindsay Lohan always seems to catch the limelight, and we can’t blame her. Lohan has been in the industry at such a young and still seen on the screens today. Lohan has appeared in some unforgettable roles like Mean Girls and Freaky Friday. Did I mention she’s also a singer and has had some hits through-out her singing career? The red-headed bombshell has faced some major backlash in the media. From her drug addiction to problems with her family, Lohan’s face has been plastered all over the news. However, stories about Lohan going under the knife surfaced particularly after 2006. It’s too bad the old Lindsay was so gorgeous and natural, that there was no need for any work. Hollywood does really get into your head, doesn’t it?</p> <h2>Kylie Jenner</h2>      <p> @kyliejenner ✈️✈️✈️ #kuwtk #kardashian #jenner #privatejet #jet #kingkylie #youngkyliejenner</p> <p>A post shared by Slayin' Kardashian (@slayin.kardashian) on Jun 12, 2017 at 5:50pm PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> ⭐️</p> <p>A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on May 24, 2017 at 7:18pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Kylie Jenner or should we call her King Kylie? The young Keeping up with the Kardashian star is on her way to owning a billion-dollar empire and we couldn’t be prouder. Kylie has always voiced her insecurities about her lips being too thin and admitted to getting lip fillers. But, recently there’s been rumors of the 20- year- old having more than just her lips done. We’re not saying that Kylie look horrible but she sure doesn’t look her age. Slow down young Jenner before things get out of hand!</p> <h2>Lil Kim</h2>      <p> 🌸💙 I C O N I C 💙🌸 #younglilkim #blackgirlsarelit #slaygoals #lilkim #dollgoals #pastelaesthetic #colorwigs #lilkimchallenge #softaesthetic #blackgirlmagic💫 #iconic #wigsforblackwomen</p> <p>A post shared by @nubienymph on Nov 15, 2016 at 9:43am PST</p>   <p></p>      <p> 💋 | 📸 @therobswanson #lilkim #queenbee #lilkimseason #beehive</p> <p>A post shared by Lil' Kim (@lilkimthequeenbee) on Apr 25, 2017 at 5:16pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Lil Kim rose to fame as one of the greatest female rappers out there guided by the one and only Biggie Smalls. Her love affair with the Notorious B.I.G was well known even till this day but it was her promiscuous outfits and sexy persona that got her notice. She managed to release a bunch of hit albums ad worked with some of the greatest names in the industry but that couldn’t change her insecurities. As a woman of color Lil Kim was constantly reminded of about what the standard of beauty in Hollywood is. Being blonde, white and model thin was not her strongest features so it’s no surprise that her skin color changed throughout the years, along with some other big changed to her body ad face. It’s such a shame she had to go through all that, as she was beautiful before she had any work done.</p> <h2>Khloe Kardashian</h2>      <p> Sort of over Andrew and Hrush in this picture but I got over it and I love them again 😝</p> <p>A post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on Sep 8, 2017 at 11:19am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Another one from the Kardashian clan bites the dust! The youngest of three Kardashian sisters and a total fitness freak, Khloe has definitely worked hard to get that rock-hard body of hers. However, some would beg to differ as she looks way different than before and we don’t mean a good way! Yes, her body looks great but rumor has it, her booty got that junk in the trunk with the help of a doctor. There’s no denying her face has had a lot of work to the point where her smile is downright creepy! Sorry Khloe, but perhaps get a new doctor?</p> <h2>Courtney Cox</h2>      <p> isn't she pretty? #courtneycox#cox#courtneybasscox#coxarquette#monica#monicageller#friendstv#friends#friendstvshow</p> <p>A post shared by f r i e n d s☕ (@matthewlangfordperry) on Oct 4, 2017 at 10:19pm PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> good morning guys!❤ #courtneycox#cox#courtneybasscox#coxarquette#monica#monicageller#friendstv#friends#friendstvshow</p> <p>A post shared by f r i e n d s☕ (@matthewlangfordperry) on Oct 4, 2017 at 10:19pm PDT</p>       <p></p> <p>It’s hard to even think of Courtney Cox as anyone other than Monica from Friends! We fell in love with the dark-hair beauty and her acting throughout the years. It’s no doubt she’s a natural comedian, her role in Cougar Town was hilarious! But, it seemed like old-age and all those fillers had caught up with the actress and she voiced her concerns about regretting getting any work done. Nowadays, Cox is back to looking more like her real self and we couldn’t be happier.</p> <h2>Heidi Montag</h2>      <p> Remember when @kimkardashian was just a deleted scene on The Hills? How time flies! – – – #thehills #heidimontag #spencerpratt #kimkardashian #00s #2000s #kourtneykardashian #keepingupwiththekardashians #kuwtk #mtv #e #throwback #tbt #laguna #lagunabeach #realitytv #popculture</p> <p>A post shared by @laguna_biotch on Sep 24, 2017 at 5:16pm PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> De cumpleaños la actriz, cantante y diseñadora estadounidense Heidi Blair Montag. Nace en Crested Butte, Colorado; el 15 de septiembre de 1986. Junto con su marido Spencer Pratt, han hecho una fortuna conjunta de 3 millones de dólares en los últimos dos años gracias a los sueldos de TV, apariciones en clubs, sesiones de fotos, y negocios… 🎂👏🏼🎭🎁📺💐🎼🎙🎬✍🏻🇺🇸 #HeidiMontag #ShowtimeRadio</p> <p>A post shared by Showtime MXDeportes (@showtimeradio) on Sep 15, 2017 at 3:27pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Heidi Montag was one of the most popular faces in reality- tv. The Hills made this blonde babe a star overnight. Her bubbly personality and girl next door vibes caught everyone’s eye. Even after getting married to Spencer Pratt she continued her reality-tv ventures by appearing on I’m A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! Not to mention her show, Heidi Montag Says No to Surgery, where she openly expresses how much she regrets her surgeries. But, it’s easy to under why she went under the knife so many times! The Hills aired many episodes of Heidi crying over not being happy with her looks from the start.</p> <h2>Pamela Anderson</h2>      <p> #dvmproduction #pamelaanderson #alerteamalibu #baywatch</p> <p>A post shared by David Vincent (@dvm_production_medias) on Oct 4, 2017 at 1:16pm PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> #pamelaanderson #pamanderson #2017 #wonderland #magazine #model #actress #blonde #playmate #icon</p> <p>A post shared by Jessica (@pamelaandersononline) on Oct 1, 2017 at 8:14am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Pamela Anderson, the former playmate and iconic blonde was spotted at Cannes looking a lot different than her usual heavy black eyeliner and ratty extensions. Although we’re very pleased with the new softer Pam we can’t help but notice all the Botox! However, no one can stop the power of aging and Pam seems to love getting older and shares that she a lot of older idols she looks up to.</p> <h2>Bruce Jenner</h2>      <p> my reigny dayz</p> <p>A post shared by bruce jenner (@bruce_jenner_) on Apr 19, 2015 at 2:39pm PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> looking shaaby</p> <p>A post shared by bruce jenner (@bruce_jenner_) on Apr 19, 2015 at 2:35pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Bruce Jenner or Caitlyn Jenner? We’re going to be talking about Bruce today, sorry Cait you have to wait your turn. Brue Jenner is a Gold Medal Olympic Champion and had even been declared the best athlete in the world! His success in sports turned into success in acting and later on, success in reality-tv. Along with being a motivational speaker, it seemed as though Bruce Jenner is unstoppable! This may be so, but you know what should have stopped? All the un-necessary nip and tuck he did to his face. He, later on, tried to fix the initial damage but wasn’t completely satisfied.</p> <h2>Kim Kardashian</h2>      <p> BABY KIM #kimkardashian #kimkardashianyoung #babykimkardashian</p> <p>A post shared by Morena publications (@morenapublications) on Aug 21, 2015 at 1:11pm PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> Thank you T Magazine Singapore @tsingapore 📸 @dennisleupold Editor in Chief @jumiusw Creative Director @jackwangg Stylist @zhuoweilun Hair @chrisappleton1 Makeup @makeupbymario Nails by Kayley Phan Production @sodachris</p> <p>A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Sep 25, 2017 at 7:01am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Kim Kardashian, the Selfie Queen herself, is probably the most recognizable face in the world today. Everything she touches turns to gold! We’re talking about clothing lines, makeup, apps, games, perfumes and the list goes on. I’m sure everyone has watched an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians by now. It’s clear that the Armenian Princess is a walking, talking money making machine. But, having all that fame comes with a lot of criticism, everyone is watching your every move. So, it’s no surprise people have a lot to say about her surgeries. Butt implants, face fillers, botox, oh my! Although Kim denies getting any help from her doctors, we beg to differ.</p> <h2>Anjelica Houston</h2>      <p> The Monday Off #tanktop #jodpuhrs #keepitsimple #knowyourbasics #anjelicahouston</p> <p>A post shared by Claire Thomson-Jonville (@clairethomsonjonville) on May 1, 2017 at 2:10am PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> Happy Birthday to Oscar winner Anjelica Houston who starred in &quot;The Addams Family&quot; with Christoper Lloyd who was in &quot;Back to the Future&quot; with Michael J. Fox who starred in &quot;Spin City&quot; with Alan Ruck who appeared in &quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off&quot; with Matthew Broderick who once dated Kyra Sedgwick who is married to Kevin Bacon who is also celebrating a birthday today. Whew! #HappyBirthday #AnjelicaHouston #KevinBacon #SixDegrees #Movies</p> <p>A post shared by Reelz Channel (@reelzchannel) on Jul 8, 2017 at 8:21am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Angelic Houston, the sultry brunette is more famously known for her role as Mortica Adams in the Adams Family but her career has been booming for decades now and we couldn’t be more thankful that she stuck around. It seems like the pressure to look perfect in Hollywood really got to her as she looks way different than her old self. But, that didn’t seem to stop her from working and is still a success today!</p> <h2>Mathew Perry</h2>      <p>A post shared by friends (@reginaa_phalange1) on Oct 1, 2017 at 3:58am PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> #matthewperry</p> <p>A post shared by matthew perry (@mattylangfordperry) on Sep 30, 2017 at 8:39am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>We all adore Mathew Perry by his amazing work in the show Friends where he plays Chandler Bing. But throughout the years it seems like Father Time wasn’t too nice to Mr. Perry as his age really caught up with his looks and there have been some rumors of him going under the knife.</p> <h2>Macaulay Culkin</h2>      <p> #spiritanimal #macaulayculkin</p> <p>A post shared by PWE III (@pablo.emery) on Oct 2, 2017 at 4:21pm PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> СМИ сообщают: Маколей Калкин и Бренда Сонг встречаются 😍 Инсайдеры говорят, что видели их вместе на вечеринке друзей 😉 #macaulayculkin #brendasong #peopletalkru</p> <p>A post shared by PE✪PLETALK.RU (@peopletalkru) on Oct 3, 2017 at 5:33am PDT</p>   <p></p>     <p>The Home Alone star takes the medal for the most dramatic change throughout the year! The 80s and 90s were some pretty good years for the young star and we all expected him to have a promising career but something went really left and it has been a long time since we’ve seen him on screen! Battling with drug abuse, Macaulay surfaced after being underground for so long and seemed to have aged extremely. It’s a good thing he’s trying to turn his life around and is looking way better than we last saw him.</p>   <i></i>
