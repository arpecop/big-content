Turns out boys, just like us, have their list of needs when it comes to choosing a girl. And that list is longer than just ‘flawless body; perfect hair’. Just like us, boys notice little things. Just like us, boys need a girl who’s supportive not just a pretty sight. Unlike us, boys will not let that know.</p> <p>But, don’t worry we’ve got you covered. Based on their Zodiac signs you will discover what your crush is looking for in a girl. And if you don’t know their zodiac sign, do you even like him?</p> <h2>12. Cancer: He’s looking for a perfect girl, but he needs devotion</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-75.gif"/>tumblr <p>Cancers want a girl who is dedicated to her lover. Just like him. When Cancers love they with full passion and devotion. They’re guarded but once the commit, they’re totally in. They’d make their life choice revolving around that one person.</p> <p>And they expect the same from their girl. But, sometimes Cancers expect a little too much from you. If you’re not ready for a commitment then don’t waste a Cancer’s time. Because they can hate you with the same fire and vigor that they loved you with.</p> <p>Cancers are best compatible with Taurus, Virgo, Scorpio and Pisces.</p> <h2>11. Scorpio: He Wants Admiration, but also Complete Confidence in Them</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-76.gif"/>teenvogue <p>Scorpios boys wear this fake façade around the world, showing that they don’t get attached. They have this attitude that says ‘I am too cool for love’. But, we’re about to reveal their secret. Scorpio guys can love with deep intensity. They will not let you know, but in their heart they know that they’re screwed (in a good way, of course).</p> <p>Scorpios are looking for someone who adores him and loves him just as much as he loves her. But, to him what’s even more important is that his woman trusts him completely. He should be able to confide in her completely and she should be able to respect his feelings.</p> <p>Signs Scorpio is compatible with: Cancer, Virgo, Capricorn and Pisces</p> <h2>10. Pisces: He Wants a Challenge, but needs Stability</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-77.gif"/>gfycat <p>Pisces wants to fix everything. They’re selfless and they take it as a task to make everything better. This is why they tend to fall with the less stable, emotional wreck; usually trying to ‘fix’ them. Pisces are not afraid to show their love and will quickly trust in you, even if it’s too early to do that.</p> <p>This always leaves them disappointed because not every relationship lasts. Love fades when real life get in the way. That is when Pisces realize that love is not the only thing required to make a relationship work. Pisces need a supportive partner, who just like him loves truly and with passion. Someone who is trustworthy and ready for a full time commitment.</p> <p>Signs Pisces is most compatible with: Taurus, Cancer, Scorpio and Capricorn</p> <h2>9. Taurus: He Wants Romance but Needs Respect</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-78.gif"/>Giphy <p>In every relationship romance is really important to keep things fresh. But, for Taurus romance is the most significant quality. The Taurus man will go over the top to show his love to the woman of his dreams. With a Taurus, don’t be surprised if you wake up with your path from bed to the kitchen covered in rose petals and scented candles. Or if, there’s a bouquet of flowers on your office desk with a note saying ‘I love you’. Or long romantic texts in the middle of the night reminding you how much he loves you. But in return, he expects you to respect him and his feelings.</p> <p>He shows you all his love so he obviously assumes some reverence from you. If there’s no respect, the relationship will eventually die.</p> <h2>8. Virgo: He Wants Practicality but Needs a Dreamer</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-79.gif"/>Tumbler <p>Virgos themselves are very practical. They will have all their life planned out ahead of them. They’ll look for reason and cause in every situation. This is why they will not be your romantic guy who sweeps you off your heels by climbing up your window at 2am. Instead, they’ll show you how responsible and mature they are with their budget planning or with their taste in furniture. In a girl, he looks for someone who is more of a dreamer. Someone who will help him explore his wild side.</p> <h2>7. Capricorn: he wants perfectionist but needs an idealist</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-80.gif"/>tumblr <p>To a Capricorn man, love is serious business. In fact, he takes everything seriously. He’s ready to put in work and not just looking for someone to waste their time. Because, he knows the value of time and respects it. Capricorn is a perfectionist who thinks he needs a woman just as work driven as hi. But, in reality, he needs someone who will teach him to stop and focus on areas other than work sometimes.</p>     <h2>6. Gemini: he wants a comedian but needs someone practical</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-81.gif"/>assets <p>Gemini, the twin sign, have two sides to them. The funny extroverted side, which is for the world. And the deep unpredictable side, which is best kept hidden. Gemini is both, equally logical and emotional. He want someone who can understand and appreciate a joke. Moreover, she has a good sense of humor herself. But, what he actually needs is someone who is sensible and mature enough to handle life and its tough affairs. If she’s funny then that’s definitely a plus point.</p> <h2>5. Libra: He craves attention, but needs a Best Friend</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-82.gif"/>dreambelievefightachieve <p>A Libra is your easy-going, gregarious kind of guy. With his heart on his sleeve and charm he loves easily and is really loveable. In a relationship he wants someone who has time for him and he demands attention. What he really needs is someone who is more of a best friend than a partner because a best friend is someone you can easily share anything with. Someone, you can confide easily in.</p> <h2>4. Aquarius: He Wants Someone with Similar Interests but Needs Someone Who Can Teach Him Something</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1476.jpeg"/>i.pinimg <p>The best thing about Aquarians is that they find beauty in everything. He is always looking for something new to do rather than following the mainstream trends. He likes it when his people have things common with him because this way it’s easy to strike up a conversation.</p> <p>No trouble when deciding where to eat, or what to listen in the car. But what he actually needs is the exact opposite. Someone he can learn from. Someone who’s different and can teach him to find the beauty in other people’s choice, too. And that muscle of Aquarius is already quite flexible. So, the more different she is the better.</p> <p>Signs Aquarius is most compatible with: Aries, Gemini, Libra and Sagittarius</p> <h2>3. Aries: He Wants Someone to Show off to, but He Needs Someone Who is Patient</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-83.gif"/>fora.mtv <p>An Aries is a born leader. He likes it to be on top. Whether it’s a school project, a summer camp group or a relationship he likes to be the controlling one. To cope with that his woman needs to be patient. Someone, who for the sake of love will rust him and have control. But, knows exactly when to put him to ground because he needs to be.</p> <p>Signs Aries is most compatible with: Gemini, Leo, Sagittarius and Aquarius</p> <h2>2. Leo: He Wants A Trophy But Needs Loyalty</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-84.gif"/>animatedmeta <p>Leo is one of the most romantic men you will come across. He will love you in good times as well as your bad. He is the shoulder you could lean on and feel protected. He usually goes for the perfect looking girl in the room. He thinks he wants someone he can have around his arm at the parties. But, what he actually needs is someone to love him back as fiercely as he loves them.</p> <p>He wants someone who’s ready to give up their world for him just like he would. Someone who is loyal and dedicated to him throughout the time. If she’s incredibly beautiful too, then that’s just a bonus.</p> <p>Signs Leo is most compatible with: Aries, Gemini, Libra and Sagittarius</p> <h2>1. Sagittarius: He Wants a Daredevil But Needs Consistency</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-85.gif"/>giphy <p>A Sagittarius is the free, living on the edge type of guy. He’s a traveler. And he looks for a travel partner just like him who will not force him to settle, rather she’ll fly skies with him. But, what he needs is completely opposite. He needs someone who’ll convince him that it’s worth settling down and making amends for the sake of love.</p> <p>He needs someone to show him the thrill of being in a committed long term relationship, the rollercoaster ride of love. She needs to be the practical one in the relationship.</p>     <p>Signs Sagittarius is most compatible with: Aries, Leo, Libra and Aquarius</p>   <i></i>
