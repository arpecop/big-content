No, donâ€™t claim you havenâ€™t done it everrr! We all have been through this stage. Itâ€™s like most of us considered it as a cool part of our lives which will be remembered throughout. Well, we were right. We do remember the instances and moments we befriended copying others in an examination hall or maybe in the primary level. Well, those moments are nostalgic TBH. Some of us got caught by the supervisors and most of us escaped really swiftly through the sharp gazes of our teachers. Well, I am donâ€™t claim cheating to be an honest practice or a good one, just narrating how most of us went through this. DONâ€™T CHEAT lads and lassies, there can be dire consequences as well. Donâ€™t end up ruining your reputation or marks.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2212-2-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>At primary level, we wouldnâ€™t cheat because we wouldnâ€™t know. We cheated or copied I might say in that case because of a really limited cognition about ethics. At primary level, students are curious about trying everything they get their hands on no? they make new friends all over, they invent new kinds of outdoor games and yes they try or construct new ways of copying each other as well. Quite Entrepreneurial HAHA. Most of us are entrepreneurs in that age group. I sure do miss childhood.</p> <h2>Cheating</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2212-3-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Why donâ€™t we talk about cheating in detail? I know itâ€™s gonna be a little boring but at least itâ€™ll educate you profoundly or maybe give you a slight hint about this practice.</p> <p>Cheating refers to as retrieval/receiving of something you want, that can be anything. The direction would be the wrong and short route to get that respective thing or some might refer to it as a reward which is quite not appropriate but for the sake of understanding, we can call it a reward. For some, getting something by unfair means seems a reward. Some people are even called â€˜cheatsâ€™ in British English or a â€˜cheaterâ€™ in American English. Not because they frequently cheat, but when theyâ€™re caught they come into the limelight and hence referred as aforementioned.</p> <p>Cheating referred as a Taboo can come up due to culture or some mentioned rules in the society. Morality, ethics can help to identify a plethora of malpractices which are considered un-apt and shouldnâ€™t be made a part of oneâ€™s life.</p> <h2>Academic Cheating</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2212-4-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Well, academic cheating refers to what we students did or do in our classrooms, primary schools or high-schools and even universities. Talking about the statistics, in the United States of America, 70% of our brotherhood members aka students confessed to practicing some diehard cheating in high-schools. 50% of the private schoolâ€™s students confess to cheating and yes there comes another factor as well, Plagiarism. Yes, if you havenâ€™t heard this term, you better should. The things we copy up from each other, the internet, articles in the same exact way as theyâ€™re scripted into our assignments or reports is called plagiarism.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2212-5-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>In universities, students try not to script things the way theyâ€™re in articles, internet etc because those assignments are run through plagiarism detectors and if they beep up to that then OH MY! Well, I donâ€™t consider this an offense for students because most of them when theyâ€™re newbies arenâ€™t familiar with this. Theyâ€™ve spent all their lives copying each otherâ€™s homework right? Although there should be awareness about this because it is considered or can be considered as an infringement of copyrights. Those articles, contents you see there on internet belong to people or firms. Theyâ€™re an asset to them and by copy-pasting their work into yours is seen as Theft. BURGLAR ALERT!!</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2212-6-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Maths has been my biggest nightmare but thanks to those applications and graphics calculators, now I can cage my nightmare. Depends upon the use of these appliances, ethical and non-ethical is totally dependent on us humans. How we perceive things and how we embody those thoughts and approaches.</p> <p>I guess the lecture got too prolonged and you must be sleeping by now but what I am about to show you further is no less than a surprise. How do they do it?</p> <h2>Some of the methods/cheating hacks widely used</h2> <h2>1. Braille</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2212-7-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Well, itâ€™s all about feelings. No, not those feelings, but feeling your pocket and whatâ€™s inside it. For this, all you need to do is take a piece of discrete plastic and punch holes in it, not just holes those should be your answers. The size should depend upon your pocket, it should be a little smaller than your pocket. So in the examination, all youâ€™ve to do is to feel the plastic and extract the answers. Itâ€™s time-consuming though so I suggest you better prepare your exam/test in an ethical way.</p> <h2>2. On the back</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2212-8-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Itâ€™s pretty much easy to execute, all you need is a calculator. Take a pencil and write on the back of the calculator and cover it with the other piece of it. Whenever you feel a need of it, just open up the backside and place it on a certain angle so that the writings should be visible to you and so that also the teacher doesnâ€™t get suspicious about it. Yeah I know, the angle placement is pretty much of a common-sense so yeah good luck with that.</p>     <h2>3. Tissue</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2212-9-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Tissue may not seem to be a good idea but majority utilize this tactic so here it goes. Write out your notes on the tissue and fold it. Practice the art of it. You take out your tissue and pretend to use it up for cleaning your nose. That way you can glance at the notes you wrote but there is a time-limit to it. You donâ€™t wanna be called the boogers-gazer right? try to wind it up ASAP.</p> <h2>4. Tights</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2212-10-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>This is a girly thing. All you need is a pair of tights and thighs. Write down the material on your thighs and wear those transparent tights, not too transparent but should be to the limit that you can easily gaze whatâ€™s written on your thighs. This way the teacher wonâ€™t be looking up at your thighs or legs and you wonâ€™t be afraid of being caught-in-action.</p> <h2>5. Morse code</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2212-11-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Well, students do develop these most often. This can be used for multiple choice questions which are quite abridged and need only an option to answer. Students can use the morse code trick with a pencil. Suppose if the question is 25 so a student will tap the pencil 2 times and then 5 times. This way they can communicate without suspicion but the tapping shouldnâ€™t be too loud and you donâ€™t know the answer to the taps, you can just scratch your head to communicate your helplessness.</p> <h2>6. Erasers</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2212-12-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Eraser is an effective tool to erase your mistakes and erase those examination halls dilemmas as well. Many kids use this tool as cheat partner. They write on the eraser and cover it up and whenever they feel a need of it, they just move the eraser a bit from the cover and there you go. They can also be sliced in two halves with micro-notes stuffed into them so when you need them for long questions, your partner, the eraser is always on alert.</p> <h2>7. Group work</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2212-13-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>All you need to do is form a Halo around your classmates and enclose them in it. No, I donâ€™t mean trap them, I mean to carry them together so that you can execute the No-Test plan effectively. Make them all miss the test except one. So even if Yâ€™all get a zero, you would get an A+ as well. This isnâ€™t a cheating hack but an act of solidarity.</p> <h2>8. Skirt with a foreign language</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2212-14-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>You can just make a skirt with the Chinese language scripted on it. All those maths questions in Chinese. I bet no one would understand whatâ€™s written there and all would be quite fascinated with the beautiful skirt you just wore to your exam. But learning Chinese for an exam is quite an uphill battle. Can you just prepare for it the normal way?</p> <h2>9. Nails</h2>      <p> Newspaper nails ðŸ’… #nailart #beautifulnail #writingnailart #newspapernails #blackandwhite #newspaper #whitenailpolish #booknails</p> <p>A post shared by Alma Razaghi (@almarazaghi) on Jun 18, 2016 at 8:59am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Damn, it seems like all these tricks are meant for the ladies. Poor Boys tch tch. Well, nails can be used for cheating too. You can apply the nail polish with the expertise to cover up all the notes with precision but that can be a problem too. The letters would be really really micro so writing them would take decades. I mean with accuracy. Well students state it as a hack so weâ€™ll take the proposal.</p> <h2>10. Chest</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2212-15-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Well, those dirty female pillows arenâ€™t going anywhere. I hope you got the joke. Right, letâ€™s get on with it. They can be used to hide those notes of yours but looking at them frequently can cause suspicion. But itâ€™s a hack like aforementioned hack so weâ€™ll take it as a hack.</p>     <p>So these all were the most mainstream hacks students utilize when it comes to dodging hard work or applying hard work in the wrong place. Well, PEOPLE.</p>   <i></i>
