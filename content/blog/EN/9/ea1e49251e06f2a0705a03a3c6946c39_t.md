It is based on people sharing their day-to-day happenings and chores on social platform. It can be said that Snapchat has become the part of most people’s life, especially the western world. Well talking about the western people, there is one thing that is worth a mention, the dogs. So we have made a compilation of images, which were posted on Snapchat, with some hilarious dog moments.</p> <h2>The “stop yawn” moment:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1818.jpeg"/>YogurtParty <p>Yawning is considered something that annoys almost any person. That is why people prefer keeping their hands on mouth while yawning. However, the case is completely different for the dogs. They cannot put their hand on mouth because they do not have one. But their surely is one way to stop your dog-friend from yawning i.e. putting your mouth in this jaw.</p> <h2>Parent-ified dog:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1819.jpeg"/>Coco_NUTs <p>We know that dogs are almost as possessive as a girlfriend. Scientists say that dogs get jealous when you start spending your time with someone else and completely ignore them. This picture perfectly explains the research. The dog looks saddened by the fact that his owner is taking care of his son and pays no attention him. This thing makes the picture adorable and funny at the same time.</p> <h2>The operated fellow:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1820.jpeg"/>redd.it <p>How often do you see a man behaving awkwardly after getting operated? The thing is that anesthesia make him do stupid things. If anesthesia makes a man do such acts then what can you expect from a dog under such influence? This picture was posted by a guy on social media, letting the world know about what his dog was doing after the operation.</p> <h2>The Polar Dog:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1821.jpeg"/>Imgur <p>Scientists have already made researches and traced the origin of almost every specie in this world. But there is one more hypothesis that I can give after looking at this picture i.e. “dogs are closely associated with the polar beers.” This picture is among one of the cutest pictures on Snapchat. Where a dog resembles a polar bear after taking a bath in hot water.</p> <h2>Its been a windy morning:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1822.jpeg"/>twitter <p>We have noticed it many of times that a movie director blows fake winds on the faces of the hero and heroine, to make the scene more intense and romantic. But what if a real wind blows? You will see dust in air, wrappers flying and people hiding. The real wind are not always a negative thing. It can definitely make a beautiful dog more beautiful. This photograph can make you believe what we just said.</p> <h2>Happy snowball-ing:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1823.jpeg"/>Imgur <p>Kid always get excited when they see the snowfall for the very first time. You might see them making snowballs and throwing it towards each other. But when it comes to dogs, they enjoy the snow fall as much as the human kids. The joy that the dog is feeling, is visible on his face. With that cold little ball of snow in this mouth, he can feel how cruel this can be.</p>     <h2>The love in eyes:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1824.jpeg"/>twitter <p>By watching the old school romantic movies, we always think that if someone loves you then it is evident in their eyes. Acting upon this theory, many people started searching for love in the eyes of their partners. The owner if this dog would have known the meaning of real love after looking in the eyes of his dog. Those watery eyes with heart-shaped black patches can make you emotional and loved altogether.</p> <h2>The early-glasses:</h2>  <p></p>   <p>Ear Goggles!</p> <p>Posted by Karen's Diva Dog Pet Spa on Monday, November 6, 2017</p>  <p>This photograph is a tricky one, which compels the viewer to think that the dog is wearing the sunglasses. Well these are not the sunglasses, these are the ears of two other dog-friends that the dog is wearing. This is the real swag.</p> <h2>A sudden burst of rain:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1825.jpeg"/>Imgur <p>Usually we see, a cloud of rain, that all of a sudden starts raining without any warning. Well the dog in the above posted picture surely met his most dangerous fear, the cold water, in the blink of an eye. Judging by the wetness of the floor and the dried outline. The dog absorbed all the rain that fell on the place where he was lying.</p> <h2>The ultimate model:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1826.jpeg"/>Twitter <p>Never witnessed a foxy dog turning into a fancy dog? Then this is definitely the picture which would make you understand what we are saying. A dog lying casually on the floor, with paws crossed and looking stylishly is camera; yes we are talking about a dog, not a fashion model.</p> <h2>The cute culprits:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1827.jpeg"/>Imgur <p>As we said earlier, dogs are mostly similar to human kids in the habits that they possess. Human children normally act innocently when they break something while playing. Well the dogs copied kids in this aspect as well. The owner posted the photo by saying that she still does not know what did they break during their play time.</p> <h2>The royal attitude:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1828.jpeg"/>twitter     <p>If your dog is standing in the cold surroundings, shivering and making horrible voices. Do not worry. Put a blanket on your dog and see what he does. He will do nothing, but standstill waiting for something to happen. It feels as if he thinks that the blanket is some kind of a royal cloak, and he is attending a royal ceremony and waiting for it to start. There are definitely 50 shades of a grey dog.</p>   <i></i>
