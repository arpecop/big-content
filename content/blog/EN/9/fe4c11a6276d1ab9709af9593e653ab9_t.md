         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 0<p> </p> <p>Have you ever walked into the room and, all of a sudden, your mind goes completely blank? Or forgotten where you put your keys or phone? Do you struggle to recall to what day of the week it is when asked? If so, you are not alone. Surveys have shown that 15% of millennials aged between 18 and 34 are more likely to forget what day it is compared to 7% of those aged 55 and older.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-654.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>In fact, about two-fifths of all Americans are likely to have misplaced or forgotten one everyday item in the past week. A combination of work and life-related stress, financial responsibilities and multi-tasking with technology have contributed to the increased forgetfulness of the latest generations. And of course, the genetic disposition of each individual.</p> <p>However, there is no need to worry if you experience symptoms of forgetfulness often – it might not even be a bad thing in the first place. A recent study published in the journal <em>Neuron </em>states that if you can only recall certain details, it may be a sign that your brain is working at its optimum pace. The research was conducted in the University of Toronto by reviewing past research. It was discovered that the hippocampus, the part of the brain associated with memory, encourages the forgetting of certain memories so that it can make space for memories it deems more important.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-655.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Basically, our brain perceives memories as an entire picture rather than a series of facts. It then simplifies the relevant information for future use and discards the trivial details. This allows it to store important information that can be used later on in decision-making. Just like the memory card of a phone can run out of space, our brain must also ensure that it does not face an overload of information. Considering the massive amount of information it processes every day, the brain cannot store every single detail so it forgets the minor ones by labelling them as “bad memories”. Other studies have also reasoned that dreams may be the brain’s way of processing and categorizing all the information it has collected during the day.</p> <p>If you look at the fact that we need only certain details to make the important decisions in our life, it certainly seems logical for the brain to do so. It is vital what information the brain filters in order for us to make rational and reasonable decisions. “If you’re trying to navigate the world and your brain is constantly bringing up multiple conflicting memories, that makes it harder for you to make an informed decision,” Professor Blake Richards, the lead author of the study, explains.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-656.jpeg"/>Wikipedia <p>So, contrary to popular belief, forgetfulness is not associated with clumsiness or low intelligence. In fact, a previous study from 2007 says that forgetfulness is a highly evolved form of intelligence. To further cement this claim, we bring to you the example of Albert Einstein. A reporter was shocked to find out when interviewing him that Einstein, who likely had one of the highest IQs in the world, could not remember his own phone number. In response, Einstein famously replied, “Never memorize something that you can look up.”</p> <p>Our brain seems to be doing the most for us while we are blissfully unaware. But is there any way we can help the process along? The answer is yes. We can actually increase the number of neurons in our hippocampus which will help clear out the irrelevant memories while storing and classifying the important ones. Here’s how to do it:</p> <h2>11. Exercise</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-657.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Maintaining some sort of physical exercise daily is integral for brain health. When we exercise, our heart rate increases, pumping more oxygenated blood to the brain. It allows the release of several hormones that create the perfect environment for brain cell growth. Research from the UCLA claims that exercise increases the growth factors of the brain, making it able to grow more neurons. According to a study from the University of Georgia, 20 minutes of aerobic exercise daily improves memory processing functions.</p> <h2>10. Grain Food</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-658.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Our brain cells require a steady supply of energy to function properly and it can get this energy from glucose. Grain foods like flaxseed and oatmeal are rich in both glucose and dietary fibre, which lowers blood cholesterol and is beneficial for heart health. It has been observed that foods that are good for the heart are also good for the brain. Grain foods also contain B vitamins which help release energy from protein, fat and carbohydrates and fuel brain activity.</p> <h2>9. Fish Oil</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-659.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Essential fatty acids are essential for brain development, particularly Omega-3 Fatty Acids. Increased intake of Dietary Decosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) has been proven to improve mental performance. These essential fatty acids cannot be made in the body and must be obtained through fish oils.</p>     <h2>8. Blueberries</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-660.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>There are two concentrated antioxidants present in the human brain: Vitamin C and glutathione. Blueberries are an excellent source of antioxidants, which may also reduce the chances of getting brain cancer by getting rid of free radicals in the human body.</p> <h2>7. Tomatoes</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-661.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Tomatoes also contain the property of protecting against free radical damage, a factor in the development of dementia, Alzheimer’s and brain cancer.</p> <h2>6. Foods with Vitamin B</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-662.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Vitamin B – including B12, B6 and folic acid – is associated with improved memory. They are vital in preventing dementia, Alzheimer’s and mental deterioration.</p> <h2>5. Walnuts</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-663.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Walnuts are rich in DHA which is an important factor in the development of the foetal brain, retina and visual cortex. It also improves cognitive function in adults.</p> <h2>4. Avocados</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-664.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Avocados contain good fats that aid in blood flow. It helps oxygenated blood reach the brain faster and also reduces blood pressure. High blood pressure over extended periods of time has been associated with brain deterioration.</p> <h2>3. Dark Chocolate</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/12.jpg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>High in powerful antioxidants, dark chocolate is also a natural stimulant. It maintains and optimizes brain activity and cognitive abilities.</p> <h2>2. Broccoli</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-665.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Broccoli is rich in vitamin K. There are several vitamin K-dependent proteins (VKDPs) and haemostatic proteins that contribute to optimum brain health.</p> <h2>1. Curry</h2> <p> </p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/14.jpg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Curry contains turmeric, a powerful spice which boosts the brain’s ability to heal itself. Its anti-inflammatory properties may also help prevent Alzheimer’s.</p>     <p>All of these foods can help improve brain functionality by up to 70%. Combining these with a balanced diet and regular exercise are going to help your brain deal with the daily stress of processing information and keep it in optimum condition. But do not fret the next time you forget your child’s birthday or your email password. “The point of memory is to make you an intelligent person who can make decisions given the circumstances,” concludes Professor Richards. “And an important aspect in helping you do that is being able to forget some information.”</p>   <i></i>
