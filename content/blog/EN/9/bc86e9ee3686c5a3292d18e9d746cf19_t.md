As a result of such massive fraud at Enron, which was an energy company based in Huston, Texas, shareholders lost tens of billions of hard-earned dollars. Many Enron executives including the accounting firm and bank officials were charged with fraud. Andrew Fastow, Enron’s former finance chief, later testified in court that many of the bank’s transactions were actually contrived, fake deals done only to create the appearance of profits and cash flowing in to maintain the books. Kernneth Lay, the founder of Enron, was convicted of fraud for duping investors before declaring that the company had plummeted into bankruptcy. Prosecutors accused Kernneth Lay of concealing millions of the investor’s money, and he was consequently charged with 11 counts of securities fraud.</p> <h2>16. Charles Ponzi Scheme</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1013.jpeg"/>playingintheworldgame <p>The biggest scam by a mile in United States history, Ponzi schemes were the brainchild of one Charles Ponzi who constructed the build-up of legitimate businesses before having them unable to achieve their expected returns. The businesses thus ran as Ponzi schemes then, under fraudulent terms and the con artist Ponzi utilized this massively in the 20’s. Based on the arbitrage of postage stamps on international reply coupons, he channeled investor funds to make cyclical payments to earlier investors and to his own kitty. Some 40,000 people invested around $15 million and only a third of the money was ever returned. Indicted on 86 counts of mail fraud and with a sentence of 5 years, Ponzi was incarcerated in 1920.</p> <h2>15. Pharmalat Scam</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1014.jpeg"/>lerevenu <p>Infamously known as “Europe’s Enron,” the scam that drowned Italy’s famed milk packaging giant Pharmalat and its senior directors, Blue-chip European and American Banks, Accounting Firms, Politicians and 130,000 minor shareholders following the uncovering in 2003, of a $14 billion void in its finances. In 2008, Fausto Tonna was given a 2.5 years sentence in the case after implication. In December 2010, Calisto Tanzi was also given an 18-year sentence and launched a formal appeal. In April 2011 after a 3-year trial, a Milan court acquitted four Banks- Morgan Stanley, the bank of America, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup of Market exploitation and rigging. Prosecutors had demanded €120m of the bank’s profits to be impounded owing to fraud. It is currently estimated that a ballpark figure of at least $17bn of Pharmalat funds have simply vanished from the books and cannot be accounted for.</p> <h2>14. Barrings Collapse</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1015.jpeg"/>BT.com <p>Massive fraudulent financial scams and malfeasance by its single employee, Nick Leeson – a derivatives broker led to the downfall of Barrings PLC a 233-year-old bank in February 1995.

He is notoriously known as the “The Man Who Stole Portugal” on account of the gigantic repercussions his fraud had on Portugal’s economy. By the year 1925, Rois had somehow managed to introduce escudo banknotes worth an estimated £1,007,963 (at 1925 exchange rates) in the Portuguese economy which was equivalent to a staggering 0.88% of the Portugal’s nominal GDP at that time. This led to the Portuguese currency, escudo, being fiscally disturbed and losing much of its credibility. After the scheme was eventually found out, the Bank of Portugal ordered the withdrawal of all 500 escudo banknotes. When the man behind the fraud came into the public light in December 1925, it brought about a crisis. He was arrested a few days later after his appearance. He was 28 years old. He received a relatively meager 20 years sentence and was released in May 1945.</p> <h2>12. Amarnath Hedge Fund Scam</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1017.jpeg"/>economictimes <p>Known as the biggest hedge fund collapse in all of history, Amarnath lost a massive $6bn of investors money over the span of one week alone. Amarnath Advisors, the US-based hedge fund whose investments were hit by a massive loss of $6 bn on account of a misplaced bet on gas prices. The firm then proceeded to sell its portfolio of energy trades and off-loaded other assets in a bid to ward off the imminent collapse. Amarnath invested most of its funds on trades that bet the persistent trend in rising natural gas prices would continue to exist. However, natural gas price declined sharply. As the losses continued to pile up, the fund’s banker called in their loans, forcing the fund to sell more assets to avoid defaulting. The sudden decrease in the fund’s value raised major questions over both, the lack of adequate risk management controls at Amarnath, and the overly lax control of hedge fund managers.</p> <h2>11. Worldcom Scandal</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1018.jpeg"/>cbs news <p>Another huge financial scam in the world’s scams history is the Worldcom scandal.

When investors actually what Louisiana was like, shared plummeted. Law narrowly avoided being lynched, escaping only by disguising himself as a beggar.

He managed to not only get one, but two huge scrap metal dealers to come up with a massive total of over a staggering $200,000 in bribes to throw the multi-million dollar contract their way. Following this deal, he then proceeded to skip town and returned to his home in the United States, where he led an amazing life as America’s most successful swindler.</p> <h2>5. The Match King Hoax (1929)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1024.jpeg"/>wikimedia <p>Few entrepreneurs in the roaring twenties were more prominent than Ivar Krueger, who owned a wide assortment of banks, film companies, newspapers, telecom companies, and railways.

International banks practically begged him to let them invest in his venture, unaware of the fact that his many companies existed only on paper and were this profitable only because they kept investing in each other. The scam began to fall apart in 1929 when investors began to want to cash out, but he managed to hold onto his control until 1932. After that point, he saw it was pointless to try to prolong this hoax and shot himself in the chest.</p> <h2>4. The Baker Estate Swindle (1936)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1025.jpeg"/>bigstatehomebuyers <p>In 1839, a man named Colonel Jacob Baker passed away, leaving an estate that comprised most of the land where the city of Philadelphia is located, a tract worth up to $3 billion.

However, there remained one problem; Colonel Baker was nothing but a mere fictional creation, and there was no massive inheritance to be had. Smith and his ingenious cronies collected a sum of around $25 million before the swindle was shut down in 1936.</p> <h2>3. The Great Insider Trading Scam (1986)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1026.jpeg"/>ny times <p>Ivan Boesky amassed a massive fortune of more than $200 million all by betting on corporate takeovers.
