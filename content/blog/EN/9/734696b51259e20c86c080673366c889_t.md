It may not happen suddenly, but there will be gradual buildup of such circumstances that will make you be in a wonderful position to find the one who was meant to be. It will seem like nothing could go wrong with that person and they will be the anchor to your love.</p> <h2>11.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1312.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>You will find the most sincere and reliable friend one could ask for. It may not be necessarily a romantic relationship but it will be nonetheless full of warmth and laughter. You will find solace in their support and you know you can trust them without any doubt. They will provide that much needed stability in your otherwise frantic relationships and social life which is almost a blur.</p> <h2>10.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1313.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>You might have faced disappointments in relationships over and over again. You may have started blaming yourself for the reasons that led to the unfortunate end in relationships. However 2018 is the year when you will learn to forgive yourself and turn a new leaf. You will forget about the past and try to rediscover yourown self. To know one self is one of the proven ways to know what you need in life. Right now you have started to realize you need to connect with the inner you and that is precisely what you are going to do.</p> <h2>9.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1314.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>It may be a very brief encounter but it will shake your very foundations about your concept of love and relationships. You may not be able to continue the relationship with that individual but they will have profound impact on the way you think about intimate matters. This will be a journey of self-discovery and will leave you with the clarity of thought on what qualities you espouse in your lover.</p> <h2>8.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1315.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>As the fate will have it you will once again be at the crossroads face to face with an old romance that was seemingly a great relationship. The universe will conspire again and make you two come together and find that comfort and happiness with each other. You will realize how fortunate you have been to find that person again since the time you both will spend together will be full of excitement and love. Embrace that person tightly this time and don’t lose them again since they are your rock and complete you.</p> <h2>7.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1316.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Unfortunately the year 2017 was anything but romantic as far as relationships go. No matter how hard you tried it proved to be absent of any passion, not even a casual fling got a worthwhile reaction. However you need not be disheartened by this dry spell of love as 2018 will offer several opportunities for a blossoming romance. You just need to keep your chin up, keep intact your usual happy go lucky attitude and you will find that special someone soon.</p>     <h2>6.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1317.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>You still think about your ex and how things could have been different. You are infatuated with thoughts of them and the time you both spent together and the memories made. This is the reason you are still staying single. Well your lonely nights of musing will finally be rewarded as that person will come back in your life. No matter how you developed your differences and went your separate ways just embrace them with open arms. Try not to have the negative feelings fester you any more as this time around you will be immersed in laughter as you will find your passion once again.</p> <h2>5.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1318.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>There will be love but very different kind of love. It will not involve someone but rather it will be the love of your surroundings. You will find joy and peace of mind by reconnecting yourself with the serene environs. It is not necessary to only find love in a romantic relationship and that one can achieve contentment in small things of life. You will be naturally drawn to this thought process and will ease into this way of thinking. Love and relationships can wait, what is important is to find self-contentment within yourself.</p> <h2>4.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1319.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>You will not realize this but slowly and gradually a long term friend of yours will take a much deeper place in your heart. You initially thought of them as someone who would always remain your friend but the relationship will evolve to such a level that you find yourself longing for them. They will make you reflect about your person and make you grow and refine yourself. In short they will be your soul mate without whom you will always feel a gaping void that can only be filled by them. It would not be surprising for you if you end up marrying that same person since it feels so right.</p> <h2>3.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1320.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>This year is about painting the town red! You are not going to be tied down any longer by societal norms and will finally have the courage to do things your way. You will try different things, brave new territories of love and simply explore your potential romance which is still out there somewhere.</p> <h2>2.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1321.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>You find yourself slowly drifting apart in your current relationship. You find the passion dwindling and interests dying out. There is no longer that excitement which once you shared with your significant other. The year 2018 will jolt you from your slumber and make you open your eyes to the tumbling romance. You will become more proactive and take measures to rectify the situation and will succeed in making the one you loved come back.</p> <h2>1.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1322.jpeg"/>Tapoos     <p>You will find your one true love. It will be a feeling that you can’t deny and if you stay true to your heart you will never even have the need to look for other options. You will always find that whatever you were looking for in romance is what your partner embodies in their character. The romance between you will not be a one-time fling but something far more significant and meaningful.</p>   <i></i>
