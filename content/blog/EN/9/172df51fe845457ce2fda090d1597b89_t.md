You just want to go to sleep soon after and snuggle in your warm comforter. As tempting as this sounds, sleeping with wet hair has a lot of downsides.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1657.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <h2>Common Cold</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1658.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>An obvious one we’ve been hearing from childhood is that sleeping with wet hair can cause common cold. However, there is little to no evidence that links wet hair with common cold directly. Common cold is caused by a virus. Although, the moisture and low temperature can result in you contracting the virus.</p> <p>A research study conducted by Ron Eccles, conducted an experiment. He divided a group of volunteers into half. The first half were asked to submerge their feet in a tub of cold water. The other group was told to do the same exercise but with their socks and shoes on. After a few days, twice as many people from the former group reported common cold symptoms.</p> <p>What does this mean?</p> <p>Although this experiment wasn’t conducted on wet hair. This tells us a little bit about temperature and the likelihood of contracting the common cold virus. It’s better to be safe than sorry and not sleep with wet hair.</p> <h2>Pillowcase</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1659.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Chances are your pillowcase is hub for bacteria. Most people use cotton pillow covers which act as a magnet for millions of bacteria. Unless you wash your pillowcase regularly, the dirt and debris from your hair and residual makeup is likely to be on your pillow.</p> <p>When you sleep with wet hair on that pillow, it can become a wild party for bacteria and fungus. This is because of the moisture from your wet hair and heat from your head provide the ideal environment for their growth.</p> <p>If you absolutely must sleep with wet hair, use a satin pillow cover or wrap your head in a silk wrap.</p>     <h2>Hair breakage</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1660.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Bed head is nothing less of a nightmare. When you sleep with wet hair, your hair is more likely to become frizzier, have clinks and be a styling disaster. Additionally, your hair is the weakest when its wet. Sleeping on a cotton pillowcase, especially, can lead to breakage.</p> <p>Be nice to your hair and do not go to bed with wet hair.</p> <h2>Scalp issues</h2> <p>As mentioned earlier, the wet and damp environment created by your wet hair, can lead to a host of scalp issues like dandruff and ringworm. Dandruff is hard to get rid of with several products in your drugstore created specifically to eliminate this problem. Dandruff is caused by fungal infection whose growth, your wet pillowcase, will encourage. Dandruff can then lead to several problems like acne, damaged hair, etc.</p> <p>Another lesser discussed issue is ringworm. It, too, is a fungal infection that can lead to bald patches. It causes extreme hair loss, if not treated properly. Additionally, it is highly contagious too.</p> <h2>More work</h2> <p>Sleeping with hair can make your morning styling routine even longer as you might have to your hair again for styling them properly. This only adds work and stress to your life.</p> <p>You might be tempted to sleep with wet hair due to the following reasons. Recognize the pitfalls so you can avoid them next time:</p> <h2>Long day</h2> <p>Yes, you’re tired after a long day but sleeping with wet hair might seem inconsequential and convenient now. We’ve explained how consequential it is and you might as well take 10 minutes to dry your hair out.</p> <h2>Long hair</h2> <p>Longer hair takes longer to air dry. Most of us do not have the patience to wait that long for our hair to air dry. Going to sleep with your locks spread over your pillowcase seems like the divine answer. Beware!</p> <p>Blow-dry</p> <p>Another reason could be that you’re used to blow-drying your hair instead of letting it air dry. So, if you don’t have anywhere to be, you don’t bother drying at all.</p> <p>Steps you can take to avoid the hassle</p> <p>Silk or satin pillowcase</p> <p>Silk and Satin pillowcases have huge benefits for both hair and skin. For hair, they reduce friction, thereby preventing breakage. It can reduce spilt ends in your hair. Additionally, it doesn’t pull on your skin, reducing the likelihood of getting wrinkles. Silk is also a naturally occurring material, which looks luxurious too.</p> <h2>Shorter hair</h2> <p>If you have long hair that is too much of a hassle for you. You might want to consider getting it short. It will take less time to wash, air-dry and style. So, if you’re a lazy girl that’s low maintenance, it’s time to get that gorgeous layered bob or pixie cut.</p> <h2>Change your routine</h2> <p>Wash your hair in the morning. It’s easier to style then and there. You’re also more likely to feel fresh and energetic in the morning. If you live in colder temperatures, washing at night can seem like a chore. Shift it in the morning to make it easier for you.</p> <h2>Train yourself</h2> <p>Even the little things in life require us to get disciplined. Build a habit. It will take time but you can incentivize the process. Keep a hair-dryer in sight. The moment you come out of shower, drying your hair should not require a great deal of motivation. You just go and grab the hair-dryer and voila, dry hair.</p> <h2>If you absolutely can’t avoid it</h2> <p>If there is no way you can dry your hair at night or occasionally you’re extremely tired or extremely busy, get a silk scarf. Wrap your hair in a silk scarf to avoid problems cause by wet hair.</p> <p>After shower care doesn’t just involve drying your hair. When your hair is moist, it is the best time to give it some moisture. There are tons of leave-in conditioners, mousses, creams on the market that you can use to make your hair look gorgeous.</p>     <p>Argon oil is equivalent to magic. It doesn’t have an oily texture and absorbs quickly into your hair. It makes your hair less frizzy while nourishing it. It’s also completely natural. Plus, a little goes a long way.</p>   <i></i>
