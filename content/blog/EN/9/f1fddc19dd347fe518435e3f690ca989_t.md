It can give you all the pain and make your condition miserable. But that is the time one should stand fast and fight the hardships because to the other side awaits the peace of mind and fruitful results of your hard work, sometimes in the form of other people helping you in the hardest of times.</p> <h2>Noticing the unusual.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-734.jpeg"/>Newsner <p>Richard Newberry is a mechanic from Florida, USA. Although he now owns his own workshop, life hasn’t been so kind to him at his younger age. He used to be homeless and a prisoner as well. His past life isn’t something is proud of but he usually compares his new life to the one he used to live and it reminds him how great his new life is.</p> <p>He usually noticed a woman, while in his workshop, passing by, who seemed exhausted and tired. It was usual for him to see her that way until finally one day he saw different expressions on her face. He noticed her crying. Her name was Ernestina Nuñez. He advanced to her and asked Ernestina if everything was fine with her, to which she explained her miserable situation.</p> <h2><strong>The Lady in pain.</strong></h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-735.jpeg"/>Newsner <p>She was working as a cleaning lady near Richard’s workshop, and she couldn’t afford a car so she had to walk to and from the work every day which is why Richard could spot her mostly. Her son had been providing services in the military. But when he returned home he started to suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to which he had been ill.</p>     <p>He suffered for a long time from such condition but his mother won’t lose hope for his better health. But sometimes you lose hope and seeing their loved ones in grief due to their own condition can be hurting. And her son did what a disheartened person would do, he committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, which left her in great distress. But the struggle of the woman carried on as she had to support her other two children and so she started working as a cleaning lady.</p> <p>She explained to Richard how sometimes loneliness takes over her mind making her consider taking away her own life, but she had to live on for her younger ones. Sometimes it can get hard for a person to live and they find death to be the solution and easy way to release that mental condition. However, in this scenario, Richard became a silver lining for her and gave her a new hope.</p> <h2>Humanity served.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-736.jpeg"/>gofundme.com <p>On hearing the woman out Richard’s heart filled with intense emotions. He knew himself how hard the days of struggle can be. He decided to something help Ernestina. So he started off with becoming a friend with her and asked her to come visit him whenever she wanted. And a hand of friendship wasn’t the only thing Richard offered to Ernestina. He offered her a car as well. Now she wouldn’t have to walk all the way to the work and back to the home.</p> <p>The car didn’t just give her the way of transportation to and from the house and work, it gave her a hope and a faith in humanity and reminded her that there is still kindness in people and she is as important to the world as her son. She is very thankful to Richard and as he gave her a hope when she was feeling blue. She said, “He’s given me hope on life.”</p> <h2>Ernestina’s Message to all Servicemen</h2>  <p>To Ernestina Nunez, her son was the one who mattered the most and she gave a moving message to all other servicemen that what they do, they do it well. They go out there and fight for and defend their country and when they return there is a huge burden on their shoulder but she focused on the point that what they do is only a job that they are performing very well.</p> <p>She means to say that she don’t want any marine or servicemen to carry any burden on their shoulder. All she means to say is that they carry out the task, perform it well and don’t bring it home with them rather they should put it all behind.</p>     <p>She said it because she knew how his son had sufferred just because he couldn’t put it behind him. She just don’t want any other mother or wife or daughter to feel what she have been through and therefore wants to help those servicemen and their family by giving a message to them.</p>   <i></i>
