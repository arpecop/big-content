However, this logical answer isn’t as simple as it sounds and doesn’t satiate people’s needs to research about this kissing phenomena.</p> <p>So let’s look at some of the reasons as to why we are constantly on the lookout of finding our love mate, desperately wanting him/her to stare in our eyes, lean into our arms and finally, KISS! Why is it that people always fantasize about this romantic moment? What is it about this moment that makes it so precious?</p> <p>The most prevalent theory of why kissing is considered so paramount is that it inculcates a strong bonding between the two love-birds. When two people are hooked together, expressing their passion for each other, they are seldom thinking of the science behind their kiss. Rather, in that moment, their mind is working on how to kiss more and how to kiss better.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1335.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Some people advocate that a kiss assists in hunting for the right partner with whom a long lasting relationship can be maintained. While kissing, people, especially females tend to gather vibes as to whether their partner is the ‘right one’ or not. As per a research, when two people are intimately close, there is transmission of biological information between them, making them screening out the best mate for themselves. In a nutshell, it puts an end to their quandary of <em>‘is he/she actually into me?’ </em></p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1336.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Another question that often arises is that why lip-locking is considered as the only genuine way of revealing our emotions? Why doesn’t snuggling, rubbing noses, or massaging butts considered enough to subdue our passionate desires? Our lips and tongues are inundated with numerous nerves and sensory tissues, making them the most sensitive of the organs.</p> <p>Hence, even a minute contact with them immediately activates those sensory nerves, inducing a feeling of personal attachment and intimacy with that person. This concludes as to why women are so picky in terms of choosing their partners based on their kissing prowess.</p> <p>This revelation also unfolds the mystery of why is kiss considered as a pivotal part of foreplay. The feelings that are unleashed when two people lock their lips, helps in escalating the sexual desires and making the act more pleasurable.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1337.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>The concept that a kiss can amend or break a relationship is clichéd enough to be ignored, but it’s a reality that cannot be denied. This amorous act, yet being so simple, elicits a feeling of being wanted and loved, and the sweetness of this moment that is felt and remembered by the two partners cannot be condoned.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1338.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>It might come as a bit of a surprise, but the clinical advantages attributed to kissing will not leave you disappointed. Gone are the days when the only health benefit of kissing that people could relate to was burnt calories. Recent studies have unveiled numerous virtues of kissing that can enhance one’s health. Strengthening of our immune system via removal of bacteria, plunged anxiety levels and a general feeling of being healthy, happy and calm can all be ascribed to the amazing aura that is triggered by a simple kiss. This disclosure must have left you to ponder over the many oblivious blessings associated with a kiss.</p>     <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1339.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>On the other hand, scrutinizing the course of the kissing history, it can be deduced that the idea of lip-locking was an emulation of the way mothers used to feed their toothless infants, in primeval times. But today, this lip-locking has a greater importance attached to it rather than just a transfer of food. It’s one of the most focal expressions of love that is evolved over times and nourishes long lasting relationships.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1340.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>This might become your favorite one, but some people posit that a passionate kiss involves a considerable exercise of our facial muscles, leading to ameliorated physical appearance. Thus, kissing not only makes you feel good, it actually is one the tricks to look good.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1341.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Another suggestion to answer this kissing enigma is the fact that man’s saliva constitutes of testosterones which unleashes a man’s sexual hunger due to which they are observed to be more inclined and desperate for a French kiss. This also substantiates why it is difficult for a man to re-take control of his emotions instantly after the kiss.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1342.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>It is also speculated that humans consider kissing as a way of depicting their level of trust in a relationship. Despite the transmission of various viruses and influenza associated with kissing, people who are passionate about kissing are willing to jeopardize their own health for this impassioned gesture. Albeit, a kiss puts you in a vulnerable position, it’s also a golden opportunity that serves as an evidence of your fierce emotions.</p> <p>As per the findings emerged from a recent study, the motive behind kissing is to experience the pinnacle of sexual excitement. Red, wet lips of a woman make a man go week at his knees owing to the ecstasy that he starts enjoying by his heightened sexual fantasies. This is why men are so eager to grab a kiss. For them it’s an end; an end that leads to their ultimate goal, i.e. sex.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1343.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Remember the awkward, zealous and skeptical feeling that encompasses you seconds before sitting in a roller coaster ride? The kissing escapade is tantamount to that roller coaster ride, where you are looking forward to that adrenaline rush, but at the same time unsure of how would you end up after being done with it. This eagerness to confront the adrenaline rush is what makes kissing so pivotal and desirable for humans.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1344.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Unveiling the science behind kissing still calls for an exhaustive investigation. The findings that are postulated are yet to be meticulously scrutinized by the researchers. So, from a young college boy who gets butterflies at the idea of kissing his recent crush, to a mature adult who wants to grab a seductive female, kissing is a serious business for all men alike.</p> <p>To conclude, the story of kissing goes a long way. From a simple gesture of greeting, to an expression of romance, kissing is something that is deeply entrenched in our behaviors. One of the best things about kissing is that we do not have to wonder about its psyche while doing it. The moment calls for us to close our eyes and enjoy the dizziness of this passionate ritual.</p>     <p>It is not to be forgotten that humans crave a kiss until they get one, and they crave it even more once they get one!</p>   <i></i>
