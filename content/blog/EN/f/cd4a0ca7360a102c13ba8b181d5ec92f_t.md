         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -2<p>No one in their right mind would want to take more pain medication than strictly necessary. However, no one would want to stay in a prolonged state of agony either, making it hard to turn down the bliss provided by pain relievers. But if there were a completely natural way to relieve pain just as easily and quickly as pills, we are sure that a lot of people would decide on opting for it. If you are one of those people, Acupressure is a method you can rely on to rid yourself of body pains.</p> <h2>10.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1345.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Acupressure can be used to treat a large variety of pains and ailments. While over the counter medication provides temporary relief, the practice of acupressure not only treats the problem externally but also heals the ailment from within so that you can get completely healed. The method of performing acupressure is noninvasive and straightforward. All you need to do is use your finger to apply prolonged steady pressure to a point for 3-minute bursts. Each point will feel a little different owing to the fact that it triggers a different region of your body. Some points might feel tense, while others might be sore or ache when you press them.</p> <h2>9.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1346.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>How much pressure you apply during a standard acupressure procedure depends on your level of fitness. As a standard rule of thumb, you should remember to apply enough pressure that it elicits some pain, however, not too much pressure as to cause yourself physical damage.</p> <p>The more developed your muscles are, the more pressure you should apply. The best way to find out the right amount of pressure is to keep applying the pressure until you feel sensitivity or pain and then decrease it to a comfortable level.</p> <p>The process of acupressure is not practiced to build a pain tolerance or test your endurance so don’t persist in applying pressure to the point of it being excruciating. Owing to the delicate balance between right and wrong, it would be best to visit an acupressure specialist once in a while to get acquainted with the technique.</p> <h2>8.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1347.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The middle finger is the strongest and longest of your fingers, making it the most suited for applying self-acupressure. While the thumb is strong as well, it lacks sensitivity making it harder to get the amount of pressure right.</p> <p>Other tools, like a golf ball, can also be used to distribute pressure evenly. It is best to remember that a massage and an acupressure treatment are not nearly the same. During an acupressure session, while you might feel tempted to massage or rub the entire affected area, it is ideal to hold the point steadily and apply direct finger pressure. The best way is to apply slow firm pressure directly to the point at roughly a 90-degree angle from your skin. If applying pressure is pulling or tugging at your skin, then your technique is flawed.</p> <p>Try to make a conscious effort to apply pressure to the center of the affected areas. Moreover, it is also important to release the pressure after a while to allow the tissues to respond and initiate the healing process.</p> <h2>7.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1348.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Every body part has different pressure points that require a different amount of pressure. If stimulating an area hurts too much, start with applying less pressure, progressing slowly to the correct pressure. Areas such as the calves and face have delicate structure in comparison to the rest of your body, thus, require a more gentle touch. On the other hand, areas such your back and buttocks are more developed and can sustain more pressure.</p> <p>One of the best regions to stimulate when it comes to acupressure are the hands. Not only do they contain a lot of pressure points, but they are also very easy to stimulate by yourself. Some regions in your hands that would benefit from acupressure are as follows.</p>     <h2>6.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1349.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Stimulating the tip of the middle finger can relieve pain in the head and neck by letting go of tension. If you feel pain on the right side of the temple, find the sorest spot near the tip of the middle finger of your right hand and then apply pressure with your fingers or nails. If the pain is being felt on the left side, use the same procedure but on your left hand. If you have pain on both the sides, apply pressure on fingertips of both the hands.</p> <h2>5.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1350.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If you start feeling sick or are getting sick, stimulating the central part of your ring finger by applying pressure or vigorously pressing or rubbing can give permanent relief. So, keep stimulating this area until the feeling of nausea decreases substantially or disappears completely.</p> <h2>4.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1351.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The ring and pinky finger can help cure a severely painful earache. Press the lower part of your ring and pinky finger simultaneously or turn by turn to help get rid of pesky ear aches.</p> <h2>3.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1352.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If the seasonal changes have got you down and you are beginning to get a sore throat, the region between the thumb and your forefinger might be the key to your recovery. Apply pressure on the delicate skin between the thumb and the forefinger and your sore throat will disappear even before it makes an appearance.</p> <h2>2.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1353.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>To reap the full benefits of an acupressure treatment, you should firstly choose a place where you are comfortable. Being in a private environment automatically relaxes the nerves. Moreover, opting for comfortable clothing that does not restrict movement can increase blood circulation, making the procedure more effective.</p> <p>Also, it would be best not to practice acupressure right before a heavy meal o r a full stomach, as it can inhibit blood flow which can lead to nausea. On account of food, avoiding iced drinks would be better as the extreme cold can weaken your body, thus, counteracting the effects of acupressure. On the other hand, going for a cup of hot herbal tea can further increase the benefits of acupressure.</p> <h2>1.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1354.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>For the best possible results, acupressure should be performed daily. Not only would practicing it regularly relieve specific ailments, but it would also be an active effort towards maintaining your health. For this exact reason, you should continue with the practice of acupressure even after your persistent ailment has gone away as it can prevent recurrence.</p>     <p>If you lack the time to practice acupressure daily, practicing it twice to thrice a week would also make a great difference. On accounts of time, limit your acupressure sessions to an hour at the maximum. Also, don’t spend too much time working one part of your body, limiting pressure to one point for a maximum of three minutes and stimulating one area for not longer than ten minutes. If you spend too long in a area, it can lead to nausea and headaches.</p>   <i></i>
