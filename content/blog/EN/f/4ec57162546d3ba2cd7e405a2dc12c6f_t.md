Like the roots of a tree anchors it into the soil and allows it to grow, it is vital for a person to have a strong base in order to explore their spirituality and grow to their full potential. But what does this mean exactly? How do we know if we’re grounded or not?</p> <p>The general signs, as identified by spiritual experts, are the following:</p>  Feeling dizzy Tiredness after waking Feeling “spaced out” Inability to focus and concentrate Forgetfulness Clumsiness Agitation Inability to complete tasks Losing track of time Inability to understand what people are saying to you Inability to communicate effectively  <p>These signs can be further divided into four main categories: mental, physical, emotional and spiritual.</p> <h2>Physical Signs and Symptoms</h2> <p>One of the most obvious signs of being ungrounded are its physical manifestations. You will often hear from others about how clumsy you are.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-912.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You keep on accidentally stepping on sharp, oddly-shaped objects scattered on the floor. Even if you notice that there is something dangerous in your pathway, you always manage to step on it and hurt yourself.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-913.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You walk into stationary objects like walls, glass doors or door frames so often that it’s embarrassing.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-914.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You have lost all sense of coordination and balance. This isn’t only in the physical sense either but you feel imbalanced on the inside too. You can’t set your priorities right and find it difficult to balance different aspects of your life. This is because all your energy is concentrated in all the wrong places.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-915.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Your concentration’s all over the place so major accidents are happening more often in short periods of time. It’s costing you a lot of time and money and stressing out even more.</p> <h2>Emotional Signs and Symptoms</h2> <p>It’s a red flag if you feel the following emotions often and seemingly without reason or logic.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-916.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Maybe once you had been a hardcore <em>Saw </em>fan or hated horror movies – it doesn’t matter. If watching anything remotely scary makes you queasy to the stomach, you need to strengthen your base.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-917.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You frequently overthink about matters that other people don’t really think about – like the frailty of the human body and mind. Your overthinking leads you to be in a hyper state of fear 24/7.</p>     <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-918.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Going to new places, sudden changes to your plans or heights may make you feel vulnerable and paranoid. In extreme cases, you may also be afraid of leaving your house.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-919.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>The realities of the world frighten and confuse you. Things that may be seem ordinary or harmless to you may be dangerous to you.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-920.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>One of the clearest signs of this is locking the doors when you’re sitting alone in the car because you’re afraid someone might break in. This is different from having antisocial disorder but similar in the aspect that being around people for too long makes you uncomfortable.</p> <h2>Mental Signs and Symptoms</h2> <p>If you’re constantly in the following mental states, it may be time for a change in your thinking.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-921.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You love planning your day out – or over-planning, more like. If something even goes a little out of plan, you feel terrible.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-922.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You think anger, vanity, self-centeredness, pettiness, cruelty and rudeness are human weaknesses and refuse to succumb to them because it’ll make you “just like the others”.</p> <h2>Spiritual Signs and Symptoms</h2> <p>Here’s how to tell if your spiritual energy is also suffering.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-923.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>If you constantly stay in your dreams and want to escape from your duties and responsibilities, it may be time for you to anchor yourself back on earth.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-924.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You might have an increasing interest in past lives, in an attempt to explain whatever is going on in your life. This is your way of denying responsibility for your own actions and feelings and is not good for your spiritual health.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-925.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com     <p>You have a heightened sense of psychic and technological energies when you are relaxing, especially in the evenings.</p>   <i></i>
