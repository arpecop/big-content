          <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -1<h2>#8: The Green Anaconda!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-812.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If you thought a normal anaconda was scary, just wait until you set your eyes upon the green anaconda.</p> <p>Hopefully not, for your sake. This slithering sibilant is an epitome of animosity and terror. It is not exactly a land beast, although it does dominate the waters. The green anaconda is one of the agilest and quick reptile through the water. For this reason, it resides in the swamps, streams, and marshes of the Amazon Rainforest.</p> <p>This threatening terror can be up to 20 to 30 feet long and weighs between 200 to 500 pounds. It is longest and heaviest serpent the world has ever seen. This mere fact makes this behemoth one of the deadliest creatures on the planet, let alone the Amazon.</p> <p>A fun fact about green anacondas is that their eyes and nostrils are on the top of their heads. This enables them to find prey easily while hidden underwater. Moreover, the contrast of their skin color gives them a big advantage in terms of camouflage. They surround their prey and suffocate them before swallowing them whole. Among their victims are birds, pigs, fish, deer, and even animals as large as jaguars!</p> <p>Therefore, it is safe to say that they are not to be messed with.</p> <h2>#7: The Poison Dart Frog.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-814.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>This frog is a particularly tiny one. However, it is as deadly as it is tiny.</p> <p>The poison dart frog looks incredibly cute but it is the opposite of all things warm and pleasant. These little hoppers are the most poisonous vertebrate in the world. They use their extremely deadly poison, called batrachotoxin, to impact the nervous system and heart of their prey.</p> <p>The fact that a tiny adult frog can kill up to ten grown men with its poison is enough to show how deadly these little things are, even though the largest ones are about 2 inches in size. Also called ‘Poison Arrow Frogs,’ these deadly creatures get their name from the natives of the Amazon who used to use their poison to coat their blowgun darts. This poison would then remain dangerous for a whole year.</p> <p>Poison dart frogs are usually found in many vibrant colors such as yellow, gold, copper, red, green, blue, and black. These vibrant shades come across as a danger sign to predators in order to warn them of their poison. Because of this reason, they are rarely hunted and meddled with by other animals in the rainforest.</p> <h2>#6: The Harpy Eagle.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-816.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>This majestic bird is one of the most beautiful sights to be found in the Amazon Rainforest.</p> <p>However, its good looks can kill. A massive wingspan of up to 7.5 feet and body length of around 40 inches propel it to number one in the most deadly raptors of the world. The name ‘Harpy’ comes from Greek mythology wherein they used to refer to monsters with bird-like bodies and human faces as harpies.</p> <p>Additionally, the talons of a Harpy Eagle are as long as a grizzly bear’s claws. These allow it to have an immense grip on large victims such as sloths, monkeys, macaws, snakes, and other animals. If it is large and it moves, the Harpy Eagle will eat it.</p> <p>Usually, the females are twice as large as the males. The Harpy Eagle is referred to as an apex predator, as it has no natural predators. Due to their huge size and intimidating abilities, Harpy Eagles are not fearful of humans and do not mind an up-close look. Here comes the bad part; Harpy Eagles are known to be hunted down and because of deforestation, are listed as a near-threatened species.</p> <p>One for the Harry Potter fans: Fawkes, Dumbledore’s bird, was a Harpy Eagle!</p> <h2>#5: The Jaguar!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-818.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The Jaguar is the biggest kitty in the entire Western Hemisphere. Weighing in at around 100 to 250 pounds and having a length of 4 to 6 feet, jaguars are extremely powerful animals.</p> <p>Typically, the male is sizably larger than the female. The name ‘Jaguar’ is derived from the word ‘Yaguar,’ a term the natives used for ‘one who kills in a single leap.’ Jaguars are most commonly known to climb up on trees and ambush their prey. More often than not, a single meaty bite takes out their victim. Bones are normal edible stuff for jaguars as their jaws can crush through skulls.</p> <p>Usually, after finding a meal, they make their way to the nearest tree to enjoy their snack time. Oh, they are also great when it comes to swimming. They often munch on fish, turtles and caiman in addition to their land preys. The most dangerous thing about Jaguars is the fact that they are very territorial. Their areas reach up to fifty square miles and they don’t tolerate trespassers. Beware!</p> <h2>#4: The Brazilian Wandering Spider.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-820.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The Brazilian Wandering Spider, unlike other spiders, does not bother with spinning webs and waiting for prey.</p>     <p>Instead, it wanders across the forest in search of prey, completely catching them off guard. Brazilian wandering spiders are also referred to as ‘banana’ spiders, as they are found in banana shipments from South America. Still, want to have a banana? We think not!</p> <p>With a body size of 2 inches and leg length of about 4 to 6 inches, the wandering spider gives some tough competition to tarantulas when it comes to size. But size is the only department where the tarantula can compete with the wandering spider. The wandering spider is much, much deadlier. A single bite can result in sweating, severe pain, high and low blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, hypothermia, blurred vision, and convulsions.</p> <p>When severely affected, the poison can cause breathing difficulties and loss of muscle control. Which is why medical attention should be called upon immediately.</p> <h2>#3: The Black Caiman.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-822.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The Black Caiman is a large reptile that belongs to the alligator family. It is carnivorous, thus making its way onto this list.</p> <p>From the six different types of caimans, the black caiman is the largest, boasting about 13 to 20 feet of length. Due to this, it is one of the largest species of alligators in the world. One of the things that set them apart from your everyday alligators is their color. Also, they possess shorter and pointier snouts and have longer and sharper teeth. This way, they gain a strong grip on their prey as they attempt to drown them.</p> <p>Its scales give it a nice little camouflage in the murky waters of the Amazon. Also, it swallows its prey whole. Usual preys include fish and other small mammals, and large ones include deer and pigs along the banks of the river. It is also, like the Harpy Eagle, an apex predator. This means that it has very few natural predators.</p> <p>Their skin, too, was one of the reasons why they were hunted by humans. This, in fact, had put their species into the endangered territory, only for it to rise again up until recent times.</p> <p>Not a very friendly reptile, we must say.</p> <h2>#2: The South American Rattlesnake.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-824.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Often referred to as the neotropical rattlesnake, the South American rattlesnake resides in drier environments such as savannas and grasslands.</p> <p>South American Rattlesnakes grow up to 5 to 6 feet long and have two stripes lining their entire body from the base of their heads. The rattle on their tail is one of their most distinctive features. They use it warn animals in the vicinity to back off as they feel threatened. They also carry out this activity when they are ready to strike.</p> <p>Containing two different neurotoxins, croxotin and crotamine, their venom makes them an extremely dangerous animal to confront. A single bite can leave the victim with severe pain, partial impairment of vision or complete blindness. Moreover, hypotension, heart damage, paralysis, and shock are also some of the symptoms faced when a rattlesnake bites.</p> <p>This snake is a very deadly one. Its appearance makes it hide well in grassy areas. Also, once you hear a rattle, you must definitely back off and disappear. Otherwise, it might make you hear the sound of its wrath. Not a pleasant thing to imagine.</p> <p>And now, we head towards the last but not the least …</p> <h2>#1: The Bull Shark.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-826.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>As you might know, the Amazon Rainforest is home to the most deadly creatures found on planet Earth.</p> <p>The deadliest of them all, however, is the Bull Shark. It has a huge advantage over all other sharks as it is one of the rare species that can survive in both freshwater and saltwater. Usually, most sharks lose salt from their bodies in freshwater. This makes it difficult for them to be able to survive. The Bull Shark, on the other hand, has stronger kidneys and this helps filter out the excess urea from their bloodstreams.</p> <p>They do not filter out a lot of the salt, however. This allows the Bull Shark to thrive in such conditions. Because of this ability, Bull Sharks have been spotted deep into the Amazon where they thrive, reproduce and hunt. Their usual preys are fish, turtle, birds, dogs, and even animals as large as cows.</p> <p>Their name comes from their aggressive behavior and blunt snout. They also have a tendency to use the head-butt as a vital hunting method in their arsenal. This usually happens right before they bite into their prey. However, a lot of theories suggest that Bull Sharks head-butt in order to recognize their victim before feasting on them. This is due to impaired vision in the murky waters of the Amazon Rainforest. After Tiger Sharks and Great White Sharks, Bull Sharks are the most avid hunters and attackers of human beings.</p> <p>A speculation also came out with the fact that it is human beings Bull Sharks attack the most. These attacks are not always reported as it is difficult to see in the waters in the Amazon. Though this is not yet confirmed, it does not take away anything from the fact that Bull Sharks are one of the most dangerous animals on this planet.</p> <p>Well, that’s all we have for the most deadly creatures in the Amazon Rainforest! The next time you visit, make sure you stay safe. And, if you see any of these animals nearby, always make sure to run as fast as you can. They fall under the category of the most unforgiving animals, alongside the most deadly. So, now you know everything you needed about the creatures residing in the Amazon Rainforest. It surely is not a pleasant place to be. There are a lot of terrors lurking on land, sea, and in the air.</p> <p>From creatures as small as spiders to raptors as huge as the Harpy Eagle, the Amazon Rainforest has it all. It is one of the most densely populated areas of the planet when it comes to wildlife on land, in the air, and underwater. From camouflaged beasts to confrontational jaguars, it has it all.
