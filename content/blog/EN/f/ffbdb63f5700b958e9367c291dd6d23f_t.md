If yes, then you are living in a primitive era. You need to give a sweeping glance around yourself to realize the wonders and the miracles that have enveloped your surroundings. A few decades ago, even a minor scientific discovery used to leave people in awe and received tremendous commendable reaction from them.</p> <p>But today, science has trespassed all limits to surprise humanity. In fact, presently, every scientific achievement is more of a shock for humans, rather than a surprise, owing to the fact that man has never even in his wildest dreams considered such things to be happening in real life.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1508.jpeg"/> @zzacariah/Twitter <p>Gone are the days when people used to get anxious hearing the news about blood donation. Then with the scientific breakthrough and medical excellence, humans devised a way of recycling their organs by donating them in their life or after their demise. But organ donation is a prevalent concept now. The rate with which science is surpassing all viable human expectations and fantasies, you must be thinking that the days of human head transplant are very near.</p> <p>The breaking news for you is that science has once again stunned humanity and that the head transplant fantasy of doctors is a reality now; an astonishing reality. And if you haven’t heard about this hottest piece of news yet, then you are definitely living in oblivion.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1509.jpeg"/>Twitter <p>Like always, China has once again outstripped the world in achieving this scientific miracle. It may appear to be more of a horror story, but this is the reality that a successful head transplant has already taken place in China, where a doctor transplanted a head of a corpse onto a monkey within the duration of an 18 hours surgery.</p> <p>The success of this weird and horrific experiment has now motivated the doctors, especially the neurologists to repeat the experiment on a living person now. The enthusiasm of these medicine experts is such that although they themselves are unsure regarding the success rate of this trial, they are still looking forward to it.</p> <p>As per them, this trial is the only key to know whether such a transplant is actually possible and will be successful or not. They are ready to acknowledge the results of it; success and failure both, in case of the latter, the idea will be dropped for good. But if these doctors turned out to be fortunate with their experiment, then this could be the dawn of a new era; a remedy to various incurable diseases and a good news for numerous handicapped people.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1510.jpeg"/>twitter <p>According to the latest updates, Dr. Sergio Canavero has gathered all the fame by publicly stepping into this controversial experiment. He is receiving critical reactions by the public, yet he is confident to pull off the transplant. He has acknowledged that the techniques to link the spinal cord, brain cells and the nervous system have been identified already and he will be using them in executing his experiment this year.</p>     <p>To satisfy the masses and gain their confidence on his skills, he will soon be disclosing out the details of the exact procedure of the corpse and the monkey experiment, so that the public can evaluate the success chances of his next demonstration. The trial on a living human being will be the first one, otherwise a lot of demos has already been done on quite a few corpses in China by this team, as a rehearsal.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1511.jpeg"/>twitter <p>The subject of his experiment will be Valery Spiridonov; a Russian scientist who has been a prey to muscle atrophy since a few years. This man has willingly nominated himself for this dangerous trial in the hope of attaining a better and a normal life, once the task will be successful. As per his statement, he is done with living a despondent life, due to an incurable disease. And in this experiment he identified a hope for himself of living a normal life once again, hence he presented himself as a contribution in this achievement.</p> <p>However, despite Valery’s inclination towards this project, the project team is still skeptical about his participation. They have argued that the first subject of this experiment should be a Chinese, since the there is a high probability that the head donor will also be a Chinese.</p> <p>In addition to this, Dr. Canavero has also claimed that this trial operation would be conducted in China, owing to the fact that the US medical organizations have not acknowledged his efforts and achievements and are quiet dubious about his project. There is utterly no backing to this man from USA and Europe in this huge and important task.</p> <p>The risk involved in this first ever human trial is immense. An actual life will be at stake. To minimize the danger and prevent the brain damage of the subject, it has been revealed that the brain will be kept cool in a hypothermal state.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1512.jpeg"/>Twitter <p>According to some critiques, including Dr. James Giordano, a US medical professor, enough research hasn’t been conducted out on this human head transplant that could assure cent percent success. He have censured this initiative of Dr. Canavero, advising him to direct his resources towards spinal reconstruction rather than the head transplant. These medical experts believe that the former is a more viable solution for the facilitation of mankind. The entire medical community is under trepidation as to whether this complex experiment will miraculously turn out to be a success or not.</p> <p>Although it’s a decisive announcement that the first human head transplant is about to happen in 2017, the details are yet to be made definite. Despite Mr. Valery’s self-nomination, there is yet no confirmation regarding the subject’s origin and identity.</p> <p>With the onset of this study, the medical community is being bombarded with skeptical questions. People are curious regarding the uncertainties associated with this risky task of Dr. Canavero’s. Questions like will the spinal cord be effectively reconnected, or will the new body work well with its mew head are being aroused from almost everywhere. The matter is no joke; it’s actually about recreating another person, rather than a simple game of putting the right organs at the right places.</p> <p>The medical experts and the scientists are looking forward to the December 2017, when the surgery is expected to be undertaken. It might bring a revolution for the global medical community and for the mankind as a whole. Doctors have their fingers crossed to see that even if the transplant turns out to be effective and the person survives, the kind of personality and emotions that this new person will conceive is an enigma for all.</p> <p>What awaits the faith of humanity is a mystery; something that would be solved once the 18 hours of this risky transplant surgery would be over. This transplant could either turn out to be a blessing for humans, something that they couldn’t even afford to dream of, or a nightmare that could be worse than death.</p>     <p>All we can say is best of luck to the recipient of this transplant, his audacity would definitely call for a hats off, as the survival chances of this surgery are negligible. Yet, for his own interest and probably for the betterment of mankind, Dr. Canavero thinks it’s worth the risk.</p>   <i></i>
