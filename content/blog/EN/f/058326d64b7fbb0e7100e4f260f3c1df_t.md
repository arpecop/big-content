And there exist several late-night Tube travels in which most travellers are drunk and their alcohol-fuelled situation become responsible for throwing all the unspoken rules, regulations and laws out of the window.</p> <p>Yesterday night a video was filmed in which you can see a guy breaking all the rules and regulations of the London underground when you can saw him sliding down the panels in the middle of the escalators in the video at the Moorgate station. And his destiny offered him a quick visit to London underground by hitting him right there where it pains. He hustled into the stop button along with his balls having the full strain of the smash as he was wearing a football strip.</p> <p>He began to scream with the pain then he stuck in the upcoming obstacle on the “Please stand on the right” signboard. He was unable to stop himself and he went down the slide continuously like an uncontrollable skier who is coming back from the Folie Douce after spending a hard day of VIN Chauding.</p>     <p>A man named James Gower (the friend of the person who experienced the tragic situation) has posted a video on Twitter to assure us that they experienced a top night along with the piste ball hitting the highlight.</p> <p>Someone wrote on the Reddit wrote that when the incident happened two of his friend begin to laugh hard on the escalator and the boy who fell down was unable to stop himself from going down for a while. And he begins to shout “are you going to help me my friends?” to make them help him to get rid of the situation. He was in a lot of pain.</p> <p>He was crying in pain and needed help to get rid of this situation. His friends entered the tube station and at that time they were singing football chants in a drunken way. They all were fully drunk and I must assume that they were coming back from a Christmas party because they were wearing the Christmas party dresses and it was freezing cold outside.</p> <p>They walked on the escalator all rowdy and drunk and started going down and the guy who was drunk the most stepped into the middle of the escalator and sat there like he was ready to go down on a slide. He started the journey and the first hurdle (which was not captured in the camera) jolted him and threw him out of the position. After that, he got hit with the second hurdle and his speed got to increase and he was like he was flying there.</p>     <p>All of his friends were laughing like idiots and they began to tear with the laugh. One of his friends who were wearing yellow dress collapsed onto the stairs of the escalator while laughing and other friends were laughing out loud. And suddenly the guy who was fallen and collided at the end of the footage began to yell “are you going to help me, mates?” After this two of his friends headed to go to help him to get rid of the situation. He victim guy was moving slowly but he was not unable to get up at all. He was crying in the pain. He was in intense pain, while other mates were still laughing and remained at the bottom. The person also wrote on the Reddit that he was also laughing at the situation but in a suppressed way.</p>   <i></i>
