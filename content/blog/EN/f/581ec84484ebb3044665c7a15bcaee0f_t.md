         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -5<p> </p> <p>Some pictures are amazing. They have the ability to transform our surroundings and tell us a story. They are called masterpieces.</p> <p>Some pictures, on the other hand, are just plain pointless. They have no purpose to them and most of the time they make the viewer question what the photographer was thinking while taking that particular shot. It becomes difficult to imagine what the photographer is trying to portray.</p> <p>In order to show you exactly what we mean, we have compiled a number of peculiar pictures for you to see and decide for yourself. Do these make any sense at all? We’ll leave that to you.</p> <p>So, without further delay, let’s get right into them!</p> <h2>#19: The overly-long scarf</h2> <p><img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1830.jpeg"/></p> Dicasocial <p>This enormously long scarf sported by this man is definitely one that will turn heads.</p> <p>As if to show that his grandmother cares almost too much about him, this long scarf was perhaps intended to cancel out the effect of regular clothing.</p> <p>Therefore, if you do not have enough winter clothes, just put on a huge scarf and you’ll be good to go!</p> <h2>#18: Wait … what?</h2> <p><img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1831.jpeg"/></p> Recreoviral <p>What is going on in this picture? We have effectively run out of all words for this one.</p> <p>It seems like there’s a man holding a sewing machine while wearing a tuxedo, standing in the middle of the park. In the background, there’s a horribly parked car and a couple of police officers having a conversation with a bystander.</p> <p>The sewing machine, the cops, and the parking, possibly make it one of the most unusual and weird pictures of this year – and the years to come.</p> <h2>#17: A symmetrical face</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1832.jpeg"/>PiP.me <p>In this picture, we see a young woman who has responded to everyone who has said her face is symmetrical.</p> <p>What she did was cut out a half of the original picture, mirror it, and attach it to another image. This shows us pretty clearly that her face isn’t in fact symmetrical.</p> <p>Anyhow, we do not get the point of this picture and its purpose of proving to someone that your face is symmetrical or not.</p> <h2>#16: The disappointed streak.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1833.jpeg"/>Recreoviral <p>This streak of tigers looks extremely disappointed with their swimming pool.</p> <p>As if to say “this isn’t the Jacuzzi,” these tigers are looking at each other in disagreement. They do not look amused at all and do not want to be there.</p> <p>This one is a fascinating yet weird one.</p> <h2>#15: A substitute for gum.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1834.jpeg"/>Gadoo <p>There is a man holding a shoe between his teeth while driving. We don’t know if it helps with the road rage management, but we’d sure like to try!</p> <h2>#14: Sharing food with … a huge animal!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1835.jpeg"/>Fotos Virales <p>Here we see a man trying to enjoy a slice of bread by himself when suddenly a huge bull decides that it wants to have a bite as well. Weird? Of course, it is.</p> <h2>#13: An unusual incentive …</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1836.jpeg"/>Eavisa <p>From what we can deduce, this coach has placed this huge chocolate croissant in front of his team to show them what they’ll look like if they don’t keep with their training! Or better yet, they could be made to eat that if they lose a game. Hilarious!</p> <p>It sure looks delicious, though.</p> <h2>#12: Oh deer.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1838.jpeg"/>Masterchollo <p>In a picture that would go fittingly with Greek mythology, this pet deer has taken it upon himself to climb up on its owner’s bed and receive some well-deserved love. How adorable is that?</p> <h2>#11: Age is just a number!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1840.jpeg"/>Fotos Virales <p>Here we see an elderly couple enjoying themselves on those small cars which children usually play with (and use to run our toes over with.)</p> <p>This is a true example of the phrase “age is just a number.”</p>     <h2>#10: “Get me-owt!”</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1842.jpeg"/>Fotos Virales <p>This little kitty has been forced to take a shower. We all know how tedious that is!</p> <p>No one can blame its reaction. Looks like Puss in Boots from Shrek just made a real-life appearance!</p> <h2>#9: The chick magnet.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1844.jpeg"/>Fotos Virales <p>This man gets all the chicks! We’re not even playing. He actually does. Just look at him; that is the look of an extremely satisfied man!</p> <h2>#8: The musical dark side.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1846.jpeg"/>Recreoviral <p>How often do you see Darth Vader playing bagpipes on a unicycle?</p> <p>Well, welcome to Scotland!</p> <p>This would have been a great character trait for his role in the Star Wars series.</p> <h2>#7: A middle-eastern cartoon!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1848.jpeg"/>Eavisa <p>This cartoon was so popular in the Middle East that people once dressed up as the characters and roamed around, poking their huge noses into businesses that weren’t theirs. How exciting!</p> <h2>#6: A clueless student.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1850.jpeg"/>Fotos Virales <p>When the teacher asks a question during class, you WILL go blank, no matter what species you are.</p> <h2>#5: Keep in line!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1852.jpeg"/>Masterchollo <p>Since when was it okay for animals to jump queues?</p> <p>Rules and regulations apply to everyone regardless of species!</p> <h2>#4: Not a very happy doggy!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1854.jpeg"/>Fotos Virales <p>This dog does NOT look happy at his human’s choice of a best friend.</p> <p>I mean, can you play fetch with dolls? Can dolls be loyal? Can dolls lick your face? Do they run happily to the door every time you get home from work?</p> <p>What an ungrateful human.</p> <h2>#3: BRING HIM BACK!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1857.jpeg"/>Masterchollo <p>In this photograph, we see a tragic separation of two very close friends. Tigger and tiger have been separated and they both don’t happy about it at all.</p> <p>Doesn’t this look familiar to when you and your best friend crashed a party?</p> <h2>#2: When the cold strikes …</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1861.jpeg"/>Rire en Boite <p>When the cold strikes, you’ll be feeling far from striking a pose. This guy right here just pulled up his hood to his face because of the cold. Clearly, getting a decent picture taken is not what he is looking for.</p> <p>That is the (blank) face of someone who has got their priorities straight!</p> <h2>#1: Are they naked?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-24-10-2459-jpg.jpeg"/>Ofpof <p>This is the uniform for the Columbian professional cycling team. Needless to say, they’re not naked at the mid-section, it’s just that the designer probably didn’t realize where he wanted the skin color to show.</p>     <p>These were some of the photographs that can leave everyone baffled. The reason behind these photographs will perhaps set debate for future generations. While you would want to make a photograph memorable some might argue the objectivity of a particular pose in a picture that basically makes no sense.</p>   <i></i>
