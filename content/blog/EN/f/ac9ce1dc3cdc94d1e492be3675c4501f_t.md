She was a nurse at a renowned hospital so everyone had to wait until she reached the matter was discussed and solved.</p> <p>When she came to the school, the headmaster taunted her on being late in which she cleared out that she had to put stitches on a girl’s face that was beaten by her mother and later, she had to deal with the police on the same matter.
