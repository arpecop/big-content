Their women wear dresses which are covered with aprons and capes tied with straight pins. Men and boys have to wear dark colored suits, because they believe that clothes are a way to differentiate them with the rest of the world and is a way to express their commitment to their faith.</p> <p>Amish women live a very different life from the women of the rest of the world. They are still considered to abide by the traditional role of the women which is to look after the family and house. Here is a compilation of some things which differentiates the Amish women from the women of the modern world.</p> <h2>10. Not allowed to cuddle</h2>      <p> This absolutely adorable Amish inspired patter by &quot;told in a garden&quot; I have been in love with the Amish series of patterns from this designer so when I found this little make on sale I had no choice but to grab this!!! Sssooo happy with how it looks, I really need to find a frame for it. #toldinagarden #amish #amishquilt #amishwomen #handsthatmake #handstitched #handmade #dmc #stitch #stitcher #stitching #crossstitch #crossstitcher #crossstitching #crossstitcherofinstgram #craft #crafty #crafter #crafting #craftersofinstagram</p> <p>A post shared by üéÄ Bronte üéÄ (@belle_stitches) on Apr 6, 2016 at 11:39pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>This might seem a bit of a shock to you but yes this is true that the Amish women are not allowed to cuddle their boyfriends. In fact they are encouraged not to have any physical contact before they get married in order to protect their virginity. The public display of affection is strictly prohibited for the Amish girls. Rather they have this tradition called ‚ÄúBundling‚Äù. It is when a boy asks the girl to spend the night at his house, and then they go to the bed they are supposed to be fully dressed.</p> <p>But when they lie together in bed there is a wooden board which separates them the entire night. This is because the Amish believes in knowing the other person without the sexual desires being involved. They are only allowed to have sex after getting married.</p> <h2>9. They cannot remain childless</h2>      <p> looks like they may have been finishing up in the garden #joyride #farmland #roadside #roadsideAmerica #roadtrip #asseen #farm #country #pa #pennsylvania #inthesummertime #summerishere #Amish #Mennonite # girls #Amishwomen</p> <p>A post shared by Anne Serody üëë (@prinsez05) on Jun 14, 2017 at 6:16pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>While a lot of women of today have the choice whether to have children or not the Amish women do not have this liberty. They are supposed to have many children so that they can grow up and help the family in their traditional businesses. According to a 1980 census the Amish women are having children at extremely high rate which equals to twice as that of a normal woman. As soon as the child comes in to the world they have a job assigned to them. For instance a little boy is born and the announcement goes like ‚Äúa little wood chopper enters the fisher family‚Äù. For the Amish people it is really important for them to tame their children from a very young age so that they start working on the fields immediately as they grow up.</p> <h2>8. Not supposed to use the internet</h2>      <p> In honor of Labor Day, here's a photo of three (hard-working) Amish women catching up during their work break. #laborday #amish #amishwomen #amishlife #lancastercounty.</p> <p>A post shared by Uday Patankar (@upatankar) on Sep 5, 2016 at 3:45am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Oh yes this might sound really surprising to you but imagine having no access to your phone, or the TV or the internet. The Amish women are not allowed to use any kind of electronic devices for any purposes.</p> <p>They consider it forbidden and a time wasting activity. Even the men are not allowed to own a desktop or laptop unless they own a business. In this age and time when most of us cannot imagine our lives without our gadgets the Amish women are only busy in their homes and are involved in looking after the family as well as children. Just think for a day that you are not allowed to use the internet to search that recipe what an awkward situation we might be in.</p> <h2>7. Take selfies</h2>      <p> #warrendunes #warrendunesstatepark #puremichigan #amishwomen #amishvacation #amish #photographer</p> <p>A post shared by Shannon Wells (@shannonseba) on Jun 9, 2017 at 5:14am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>How many selfies do you take in a day? I am sure if you start counting the number of selfies in you smartphone there would be many. But the Amish women are not allowed to indulge in all this after they get baptized in their teenage years. They are not allowed to give any interviews to the media even if someone agrees to the interview they request that their face be blurred out. The only photo they are allowed to have is when they are young because children are not supposed to abide by the religion rules.</p> <p>Amish women can be caught on just a candid photo. There are many places where there is a sign of not doing any photography.</p> <h2>6. Study at college</h2>      <p> #amishwomen #afterthewedding #amishcountry Just a quick shot as I drove by‚Ä¶.</p>     <p>A post shared by Rachel N Leon (@racheln.brk) on Nov 2, 2017 at 5:10am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>While many of us dream to pursue our favorite degree at college the Amish women are deprived of this opportunity. Although they are given the basic education but they are not allowed to attain beyond grade eight. They believe that getting advanced education might affect their children negatively. Even the boys are not allowed to go for higher education but have to help their parents in the traditional business of the family. For instance the boys are supposed to help the father in the field and the girls have to help the mothers in the household chores.</p> <h2>5. Glam up</h2>      <p> Amish #amish #amishwomen #wayoflife #usa #timestoodstill</p> <p>A post shared by Ron Tourlamain (@tourlatourlala) on May 25, 2017 at 5:00am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Have you ever imagined leaving your house without wearing any jewelry? Rather we might end up spending a lot of time in front of the mirror before going out of the house don‚Äôt we? The Amish women are not allowed to wear any kind of jewelry when they are at home or are present at a social gathering. They think that staying simple is what the religious requires them to be. Wearing jewelry is considered as a sign of pride therefore the women do not indulge in the deed. Even if they are getting engaged they do not wear nay kind of rings rather they clasp the hands of their prospective husband while the Bishop blesses them.</p> <h2>4. Wear a wedding gown</h2>      <p> #amish #amishfarm #amishlife #theamishvillage #amishgirl #amishwomen #clothes #amishclothes #black #blue</p> <p>A post shared by Jay Yadlovski (@jayyadlovski) on Oct 3, 2014 at 4:43am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>The Amish women do not get married the way any modern women does. Although the Amish take weddings very seriously and once married the Amish women are not allowed to get divorced. Also the Amish women are not allowed to go around the entire town shopping for their wedding gown. By the way the engagement is also kept quite a secret until it is announced in the Church a few weeks before the marriage. The couple is supposed to invite all the guests personally. As part of the traditions the bride has to design and sew her own wedding gown but the color and design can be of her own choice in some communities, while the other restrict the color blue for the dress. The interesting part is that the Amish women have to wear the gown to the Church services held on Sunday. She is even buried in the same dress, which might sound a little weird to you but for them this is the way of life they are leading.</p> <h2>3. Take part in family decisions</h2>      <p> Style goals üíô #amish #beautiful #simplicity</p> <p>A post shared by Mindy Sue Bell (@mindysuebell) on Nov 8, 2015 at 10:01pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>The modern day women takes part in the family decision because her input is required and valued as well. But the Amish women are not allowed to take part in the family decisions and are also supposed to abide by what their husband tells them to do. Amish do not care if the outsiders perceive them to be primitive but they abide by the laws of the Bible irrespective of what the society thinks about them.</p> <p>Moreover, the women are treated with a lot of respect in the Amish community as according to their culture they are supposed to be non-violent, be kind to everyone and maintain peace in the community. The men are expected to stay humble and do not show any aggression to anyone who they encounter with be it any situation. So even if the women does not take part in crucial decisions of the family she is never looked down upon and is always treated with love and humility.</p> <h2>2. Go to the parlor</h2>      <p> Banshee is a show that definitely feeds my attraction to Amish women. #banshee #lilisimmons #rebeccabowman #amish #cinemax #tv #amishfetish #pennsylvania #bansheecounty @liliflower33 #amishwomen #rumspringa #amishgirls</p> <p>A post shared by Dill (@dillwashere) on Nov 16, 2016 at 7:35pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>The Amish women do not enjoy the freedom to dress up according to their wishes just like the modern women of today. They always wear the same clothes wherever they go and never wear anything which is in fashion. They even do not wear any make-up and are not allowed to go the parlor to get dolled up. They do not consider such women who indulge in all these activities as good women.</p> <h2>1. Their dolls do not have faces</h2>      <p> &quot;What are they doing over there ?&quot; ‚Äì Village of Strasburg, PA #amishchildren #amishlife #amishwayoflife #lancastercountypa #southernlancastercountypa #localslovelancastercountypa #amishcountry #thesimplelifeinlancastercountypa #lifeandtimesinlancastercountypa #amishfarms #amishfarmlife #amishtaxiguywanderings</p> <p>A post shared by George (@amishtaxiguy) on Aug 1, 2017 at 12:42pm PDT</p>   <p></p>     <p>This might be even more surprising for you but the dolls which Amish girls play with do not have any faces since they consider it a violation of the religious teachings.</p>   <i></i>
