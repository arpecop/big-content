         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 0<p>“London Bridge is down!”</p> <p>Reportedly, this is the code that will trigger the series of events, workings, procedures and plans of action following Queen Elizabeth’s death. We all hope that day is still very far, but no one, not even Her Royal Highness, is safe from death’s embrace. Everyone loves Queen Elizabeth – from singing her praises in the British national anthem to her face donning the banknotes, Queen Elizabeth is and always has been the figurehead of all things British. Currently the longest reigning Monarch in the world, the Queen sadly, is to leave this world one day, causing a lot of changes to take place. From a change in the Monarch to a new national anthem, here are some changes that will take place when Queen Elizabeth passes away.</p> <h2>11. The new King</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-941.jpeg"/>Solar Navigator <p>The Throne is never left unattended, and the day his mother passes away, Prince Charles will ascend to the Throne as King Charles III. As per standard protocol, he will then immediately visit Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, which are the capitals of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – the devolved governments. He will swear under oath the protect the Church and will be the new ruling Monarch. Queen Elizabeth’s throne will now occupied by Queen Camila, who is Prince’s Charles’ wife. Though some people are very happy about that, a lot of people miss the Queen already when they hear of Queen Camila. Mixed emotions about this!</p> <h2>10. A notification</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/aaa.jpg"/>Shutterstock <p>There’s no question that the Queen’s death will be a matter of great concern for each nation in the world, but the commonwealth states, where the U.K. colonies were once hustling and bustling, will be the first to know. Upon her death, the first person to be notified outside of the palace will the Prime Minister at the time. He or she will then have to inform the governments of the 15 countries where the Queen is Head of State. The Prime Minister will then have to notify the 36 commonwealth countries’ governments which include Canada, Australia and New Zealand. No doubt about it, it will indeed be a day of great sorrow for the entire world.</p> <h2>9. Breaking news!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-943.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Well now that we’ve established that the news will be of great importance to the nations of the world, it only furthers the argument that the people will be aggrieved too. Though with advances in social media and electronic press, news these days spreads around the world like wild fire, there will be two official sources confirming the news. The first is the Royal Family’s official press, Clarence House, which will present the news to all sources. Though technically, it should be the BBC which gets the news first, it can’t really be said, considering how we just agreed about the speediness of the internet and the concept of globalization. The second source will be that a Palace front-man dressed in all black will post an official death notification outside Buckingham Palace. This will share the sad news with all those close by.</p> <h2>8. All black</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-944.jpeg"/>Style Craze <p>Considered a color of mourning, all British news presenters will appear in all black over the television and the Royal Family’s official website which conveys all important updates will also be in monochrome. All television stations will be airing recorded and practiced eulogies (that’s some good journalism!) and the BBC will not air any comedy. Radio channels will disrupt their usual programs and run serious news notifications to keep everyone updated. Only ‘appropriate’ music will be played and a newsflash will be aired every 15 minutes. A sad day for television watchers and motorists alike.</p> <h2>7. Parliament recalled</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/aa.jpg"/>Shutterstock <p>With the Monarch’s death, Parliament will be recalled. The British Parliament, alike many other Parliaments, is divided in two houses. One is the House of Lords and the other is the House of Commons. Both will be recalled upon the Monarch’s death. If the Parliament is for some reason in a recess, or if the Prime Minister is not in London, everyone is expected to show up there as a matter of great urgency, and for good reason. It is highly likely that the governments of the commonwealth countries will also meet up on a very urgent basis.</p>     <h2>6. National Mourning</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-946.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Following the Queen’s death, 12 days of national mourning will be announced in the U.K. and it is likely that there will be some form of mourning or another, in the commonwealth countries as well. Offices, schools and markets are expected to close and everyone will be sent home. The Union Jack will be seen flying at half-mast, as a symbol of sadness and mourning. Moreover, all games taking place at the Royal Parks will be called off and any national or international fixtures will be delayed as well. So why 12 whole days, you might ask? Well, the Queen’s funeral won’t be held until the 9th day. The Stock Market is also expected to close on the day the Queen dies, and the day will be marked as a national holiday in the U.K. Possibly, in the commonwealth countries too!</p> <h2>5. A Royal Farewell</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-947.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Transportation arrangements are always on standby in event of the Queen’s death. If the death is to take place outside of the U.K, special arrangements are ready for that. Ultimately, her first stop will be Buckingham Palace and then to Westminster Hall where she will lay in State, as per tradition. This will perhaps be the first time she will meet as much general public as a huge headcount is expected due to the lying in state being in place till the day of the funeral, and the fact that it is open for all. On the 9th day, the funeral is expected to take place at 11 a.m. at Westminster Abbey with 2000 guests expected, which includes dignitaries from all across the world. Her body will be taken to its final resting place at Windsor Castle by Road, and again, a huge turnout is expected.</p> <h2>4. The Vault</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/Untitled-14564.jpg"/>Shutterstock <p>The Queen’s body will be descended into the Royal Vault at Windsor Castle in a private event where only members of the Royal Family are allowed. The Royal Vault is where the other deceased members of the Royal Family are resting eternally and is an attraction for thousands to see.</p> <h2>3. Currency changes</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-949.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The U.K. as well as many commonwealth countries have the Queen’s face printed and embellished in currency notes and coins. It is said that around the 10 day mark after her death, the Queen’s face is to be replaced with that of King Charles’, who will have replaced the monarch in office. This change is also expected to take place in the commonwealth countries.</p> <p>The commonwealths all get along fairly well, but the next point is a guess made by historians and the makers of eminent contributions to politics, the law and various other fields of social sciences.</p> <h2>2. The commonwealths will break</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-950.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Perhaps the most dramatic outcome of the Queen’s death, it is speculated that the commonwealths will break up. The leading example of this in today’s time is that of Australia. Since quite some time now, Australia has wanted to become a Republic, which is a no-strings-attached kind of business. If Australia is to succeed in this demand, it is highly likely that other states would want the same for themselves. This is why, as we previously said, that King Charles will tour the commonwealths right after assuming office. This could very well be a move of consolidation!</p> <h2>1. International reflection</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-951.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Queen Elizabeth has been part of the Royal Family from its glory days to the rainiest of days. From a time where the British Empire existed and now to a time where there is no Empire and just a ‘single country’, the Queen has seen it all. Her death will revoke a strong spirit of rich history amongst everyone and the citizens of the commonwealths especially, who will feel a personal connection for perhaps the first time.</p>     <p>Though we still hope that day is very far and that the Queen lives to see not only the U.K. but the whole world as a happier, safer and more prosperous place, no one can skip the embrace of death and as we can see that emergency standbys and protocols are already in place, it is more than evident today that this is a reality. What would your sentiments be on the Queen’s death? Do you know think these measures are proportionate? Let us know!</p>   <i></i>
