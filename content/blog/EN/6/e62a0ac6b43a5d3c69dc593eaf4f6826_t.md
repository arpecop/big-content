Women usually have the tendency to exhaust men emotionally, but that is not always the case. We completely understand that people do person experiences many “thick and thins” during their lives. But even then this excuse is not enough to cut out communication with your partner and leave her stranded.</p> <p>If your partner hesitates while telling the truth, then this compilation is tailor-made for you.</p> <h2>15. No more love</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-798.jpeg"/>www.shutterstock.com <p>The moment your partner starts complaining that “you are not the same anymore”, get alert dear. This is the very first sign of falling out of love. But this is not it. Eventually, there’ll come a time when he’ll say that you don’t love him anymore, and that’s when you’ll go mad. Remember, going mad is no bad. In fact, you have the right to go crazy if he is putting HIS FAULTS on your shoulder.</p> <h2>14. Demanding space</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-799.jpeg"/>www.shutterstock.com <p>It starts with you spending days and nights with your partner; and all of a sudden he backs off. This demand for space is not a problem at all, but that does not mean that it cannot trouble your relationship. Do not let the demand growth. Try and kill it as soon as possible. The expanding distance between both of you can prove to be a perfect invitation for the breakup agents.</p> <h2>13. No clear direction</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-800.jpeg"/>www.shutterstock.com <p>If your man wants to be with you, he will do anything to stay with you and make you feel easy. Your relationship will lose its freshness when he starts losing interest in you. Your partner ignoring the material things in your relationship and getting confused regarding the future is one of the top reasons behind the death of the love between both of you.</p> <h2>12. Excuses, excuses and excuses….</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-801.jpeg"/>www.shutterstock.com <p>Believe it or not, your partner will have the dumbest excuses for not doing almost everything that you would want to do with him. It seems like as if he has suddenly become a skilled excuse maker for everything every time. Moreover, your weekend plans might even get cancelled too, and that even very frequently. Well, if you notice this then that means you both are ready to fall down.</p> <h2>11. Making new friends</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-802.jpeg"/>www.shutterstock.com <p>If your partner is continuously ignoring you when he is with his friends then you should better worry. To make male friends is not a big issue. The problem starts when he starts spending time with girls that you do not know. Moreover, he keeps them as his first priority and pays zero attention to your text messages.</p> <h2>10. Lost interest</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-803.jpeg"/>www.shutterstock.com <p>Thing gets even trickier when a guy stops paying attention to what his girlfriend says. Imagine that you are telling your guy an extremely important story, and he hears it physically but ignores listening to it mentally. This indicates that he does not own your problems anymore.</p> <h2>9. The boring date nights</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-804.jpeg"/>www.shutterstock.com <p>At the start, spending the nights dating with your partner was fun. But now the things are not same. He is no fun at all, he gives a same old reply to everything that you say, he does not tell you what’s going on in his life, he keeps scrolling his phone and you have nothing to discuss; are all the signs that it’s not working anymore. Probably he has already found something or something more attention-worthy.</p>     <h2>8. Ignoring the physical part</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-805.jpeg"/>www.shutterstock.com <p>Yes, we know that relationships are all built around the emotions and feeling and mental factors. But that never eliminates the importance of the physical aspect. Spending nights together and having a whole lot of fun holds its own significance. If he repeatedly avoids getting physical with you, then this surely means that he is weakening one of the main pillars that your relationship is standing on.</p> <h2>7. He doesn’t try anymore</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-806.jpeg"/>www.shutterstock.com <p>If your partner shows lack of interest in your day because he doesn’t care about how was your day or if your relationship is just a normal and a regular routine, then you need to think about your relationship with a person who makes your relationship a routine for you which often becomes dull and boring. A relationship which is based on love is not a routine and it shouldn’t be that way.</p> <h2>6. Getting cheap</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-807.jpeg"/>www.shutterstock.com <p>Every girl wants her guy to treat her like a queen. A girl always gets treated like a daddy’s princess, and she demands the same treatment from her partner. Yes, your partner used to pay bills and treat you well when it all got started. But you should occasionally check that where your relationship stands. Is he asking you to pay the bills? Is he continuously abusing you? If that is the case then do not listen to his lame excuses and ask him to treat you right.</p> <h2>5. He forgets</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-808.jpeg"/>www.shutterstock.com <p>Both of you make plans when you are on call and the other day he completely forgets about the plans that you made. He remains busy and avoids the meeting that he planned for you. He forgets your birthday and even neglects to wish you a happy anniversary at 12:00 am. This probably means one thing, which is that your relationship is not the first thing on his mind. He does not think of you the way he did before.</p> <h2>4. He wants to change you</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-809.jpeg"/>www.shutterstock.com <p>You guys seemed perfect to each other in the beginning. After some time, you starting noticing his flaws and loved him even more for them.</p> <p>But the case with your partner is vice versa. He used to tell you he loves you but now he wants to change you. He gets annoyed by everything you do. This is a sign that love is long gone and you need to think about maybe reinvesting in your relationship.</p> <h2>3. He always plays the blame game</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-810.jpeg"/>www.shutterstock.com <p>Relationships are all about mutual understanding. It requires combined efforts for a love story to flourish. One must accept his/her faults in a relationship and try to rectify what went wrong. Well if your partner is playing the blame games and eventually blaming you for everything that went wrong, then we have a bad news for you. He might be hiding his flaws, deficiencies and mistakes while playing such games.</p> <h2>2. He’s too busy</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-811.jpeg"/>www.shutterstock.com <p>He’s reluctant in spending time with you. Things are not the same anymore. You might find him distracted than usual in your presence, which shows that he just doesn’t want to spend time with you physically when you are there. He would look into his mobile phone or maybe in some other stuff and would demand distance and space. His distance only means that he’s not into it anymore.</p> <h2>1. No calls or texts</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-812.jpeg"/>www.shutterstock.com <p>In the ancient times, people used to communicate through the letters that were sent via pigeons or the postmen.</p>     <p>The sending process took hours, even days, to communicate. But if your partner takes hours and days to reply in today’s world of electronic communication, then our conclusion would be no surprise to you. He has found some other ways of amusing himself.</p>   <i></i>
