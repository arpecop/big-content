What seemed like a normal thing proved fatal for the 33 year old, Abare, and changed her life forever.</p> <p>It all happened on the fateful night of Oct 10, when after tucking her children to bed she decided to go to the Stewart’s convenience store. It seemed like a normal night just before her one of the headlights on her car wouldn’t light up. Without giving it much thought she decided to lift the hood and inspect a running car.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-311.jpeg"/>Ideasfun <p>Little did she know that her long thick hair was actually about to get her in trouble and almost cost her, her life. As soon as she bent down to inspect the car engine closely, her hair in split seconds got caught in the spinning fan belt of the car. She never got the chance to do anything and within seconds the situation was clearly out of her hands.</p> <p>“It took me a minute to feel what was going on,” she said. “Later I found out I broke my skull — a piece of it was gone, and I was scalped — thankfully I didn’t know then. My head had broken a piece out of my radiator housing too,” she said.</p>     <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-312.jpeg"/>Ideasfun <p>She was critically injured and scalped. Things would have been worse had her two children not been there that day. As soon as her hair started to pull her down the hood she screamed, after spitting out a tooth, for help and acting wisely her son Samuel, 11, immediately turned the car’s engine off. Her daughter, Logan, 9, came to aid her mother as she cut the hair off with the help of scissors.</p> <p>In an interview with Inside Edition, Alon said, “They were focused and they were driven by, I think, you know, they wanted to save their mom.”</p> <p>“They were focused and they were driven by, I think, you know, they wanted to save their mom,” she added.</p> <p>The accident fractured her skull and ripped most of the hair out after tearing her scalp off her skull.</p> <p>The damage was so extensive that it was impossible for doctors to patch the scalp back or to grow hair on what was left. She now hides are horrific scars by wearing a wig. She needs to use the wig until her scalp heals enough for doctors to try a hair transplant.</p> <p>Alon, however, is soldering on and knows that she needs to live a normal life. And the wig, she believes is helping her live a normal life when in public.</p> <p>“I can put my wig on and I can go out and it seems like nothing changed. I can pretend that I’m the same,” she bold woman said in her interview.</p> <p>However, the bitter reality cannot be ignored that Alon will most certainly never be able to forget the tragic incident.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-313.jpeg"/>Ideasfun     <p>This horrific accident should be a reminder for everyone with long hair to tie hair before popping the hood of running car.</p>   <i></i>
