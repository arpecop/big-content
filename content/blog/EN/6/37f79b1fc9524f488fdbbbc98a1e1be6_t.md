Start off by lying flat on your back with your knees bent and your feet on the floor. Be sure to make your entire body stable throughout this move. Place your hands behind your head or place them on your abdomen and lift upwards so as to bring your chest to your knees. Exhale slowly as you come up and inhale slowly as you go back down. Repeat for a few repetitions.</p> <h2>Twist Crunches</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2215-22152.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>When it comes to burning belly fat and building up some endurance, nothing works better than good old Crunches. Start off by lying flat on your back with your knees bent and your feet on the floor.. Place your hands behind your head and bring your right elbow towards your left side. Hold for one second and then repeat with the left elbow. Keep at it for a few repetitions and carve away those obliques!</p> <h2>Bicycle Crunch</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2215-22153.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>This is an advanced move but man oh man, is it effective! Again, get into the plank position with lying flat on your back with your hands to the sides of your head. Lift both your legs straight into the air and bend your knees. Bring in your right knee at a bent angle and stretch out your leg. Try the same with the left leg, as if pedaling a bicycle. Remember – don’t hold your breath and keep breathing through!</p> <h2>The Plank</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2215-22154.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Oh, the nice and solid plank! A tried and tested way of shedding that extra fat, start by lying flat on your stomach and lifting off the ground on your toes and wrists. Make fists with your hands for extra stability and ensure your back is straight and parallel to the ground. Hold this position for a good sixty seconds.

Be it running, jogging, cycling or jumping jacks, cardio is a great way to shake off that unwanted flab and give you the solid body you deserve. Just remember to never engage in cardio right after a meal – we recommend giving it a one-hour gap at the least and try to be persistent. That six-pack isn’t too far!</p> <p>Always remember to make your workouts explosive and very intense as compared to slow and lethargic. Your body is like a stick of dynamite – it’ll never blow if you keep tapping it for hours with a pencil. Know how to detonate into that core and engage it for the whole workout. However, that’s not the only way to keep those pounds off. Here’s how you can make sure you stay healthy throughout the day!</p> <h2>Have a fiber-rich diet</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2215-22156.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Once inside your digestive system, fiber swells up and creates a thick and moist paste when it mixes with water. Not only does this give you the feeling of being full and doesn’t incite hunger, it also has been proven to fix up any digestive issues. Another benefit of fiber is that it prevents your digestive system from absorbing too many calories from the food you eat, so you as long as you’re taking that husk – you don’t have to be too particular about what you eat! Go for legumes and flax seeds for your daily dose.</p> <h2>Avoid any foods with trans fats</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2215-22157.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Found mostly in margarine and packaged foods, trans fats have been proven to be linked to insulin resistance, inflammation and overall fat accumulation in the body. A six-year study shows that monkeys subject to a high trans-fat diet over six years had 33% more fat in their bodies as compared to those who were subject to a mono-saturated diet. We may not be as primitive anymore but the digestive workings are very similar, so let’s not run the risk! Mono-saturated is the way to go!</p>     <h2>Eat a high protein diet</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2215-22158.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>They say being a vegetarian is a big missed steak – and we really can’t disagree with that. High protein diets have been proven time and again to be very effective. Perhaps due to the fact that protein stimulates the body to secrete the PYY hormone that creates a feeling of feeling full all the time and so you won’t find yourself scanning the fridge ever so often. More research shows that people with a high protein diet have much less abdominal fat than those who don’t like their protein. Be sure to eat your lean meat be it red or white, include eggs into your diet too and snack on nuts in moderation. No more fat!</p> <h2>De-stress yourself</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2215-22159.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Stress is a killer – there isn’t any doubt. Scientifically though, it’s because it triggers the secretion of cortisol in the body that impacts the mind and the heart. This is directly linked with an increase in appetite and as we all know – the more you eat, the more pounds you pack on. This is particularly true and more common in women than men, with women’s waists going much wider due to high cortisol levels. Calm yourself and engage in more fun stuff, like perhaps yoga or meditation.</p> <h2>Easy on the sweet stuff</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2215-221510.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Unless type-2 Diabetes, liver damage, and abdominal fat are on your bucket list, you might want to stay away from too much sugar. The real culprit being fructose, sugars have a lot of unnecessary calories and these result in the chronic diseases we just listed for you. Avoid sugars by cutting down on juices and soda, and go for healthier alternatives like fresh juice and Stevia extract, which are derived from natural sources.</p> <h2>Use coconut oil</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2215-221511.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>A boosted metabolism and less fat storage on the body for the calories you eat? Yes, please! Coconut oil, studies show, is perhaps the healthiest fat you can eat. In a recent study, men who consumed coconut oil for 12 days, lost 1.1. inches off their waists without engaging in any particularly excessive exercise. All you need is around two tablespoons of the coconut goodness a day and you’re all set. This doesn’t go without saying that coconut oil doesn’t have any calories or fats, albeit healthy, but cut down on calories elsewhere in your diet to have this instead. Perhaps ditch the soda for some nice and cold water?</p> <h2>Sleep on it</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2215-221512.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Would you be surprised to know sleeping can actually help in keeping those pounds off your abs? Studies show that people who sleep less tend to have more belly fat than people who have had their rest for a good 8 hours or so. A 16-year study showed that out of 68,000 women, those who slept for only 5 hours a night had greater belly fat than those who slept for 7 hours a night. However, sleeping more isn’t key here. Quality sleep is.</p> <h2>Apple Cider Vinegar</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2215-221513.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Consuming this acidic potion isn’t a daring challenge without its merits. It helps lower belly fat and also promotes lower blood sugar levels. The acetic acid, which Apple Cider Vinegar comes packed with, helps burn up to as much as half an inch off your waist in 12 days without any additional exercise. Though the stats are a bit disputed, taking a tablespoon a day is more than sufficient for fat loss – and if you can swallow it all in one go, we salute you.</p> <h2>Green Tea</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2215-221514.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Green Tea has proven time and again to be the wonder drink. Full of caffeine and metabolism boosting extracts. Green Tea helps burn belly fat and has also been known to soothe and relax the body and mind. Sip through some throughout the day, but just remember to make sure it’s a bit warm because that’s when it’s the most effective.</p>     <p>So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
