         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 1<p> </p> <p>It seems that whenever you pay visit to the local barber, you have to hold your breath and keep your fingers crossed for the end result. You imagine yourself emerging from the hairdresser’s as a brand-new person but the reality is quite different. Sometimes, you might not like how ‘brand-new’ you look. Here are 10 people who definitely received a surprise after miscommunicating with their hairdresser.</p> <p>Casual chit-chat is common during the haircut. Anything to pass the time or make the experience less awkward, right? You sit there, a gown around you, staring at your reflection in mirror. Resembling a lost, soaked puppy with your wet hair as you shift uncomfortably under the careful gaze of the hairdresser. And then your eyes meet in the mirror and the hairdresser asks you the fateful question: “So, what do you want?”</p> <p>A general answer is, “Just a trim”. You can enunciate the number of inches you want off. The hairdresser could pipe in their opinion here and there, suggesting a style that they may think will suit you. If you are daring enough, you could go along with what they say. But if you want to maintain the same old, familiar hair, you could stick to your previous trimming option.</p> <p>You think the hard part is over and all that’s left is you closing your eyes and relaxing until the hairdresser’s done. But the moment you open your eyes again, you’re met with a monstrosity atop your head. You are stunned, horrified, petrified. But can only nod your head dumbly when the hairdresser asks if you like it. You see, you forgot the fact that you kept on chatting about random things to the hairdresser.</p> <p>Maybe you were joking around, or being sarcastic. But something you mentioned might have ignited the, err, artistic spirit of your hairdresser. You didn’t mean to but now you have to deal with the consequences. And it’s too late to go back. Your hair locks are on the floor of the barbershop and you can only pray fervently to yourself that the ones on your head grow back soon.</p> <p>Here are a few people who had to deal with the consequences of what they may have asked from their hairdresser.</p> <h2>10. Moustaches are overrated, give me a head-stache</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-284.jpeg"/>Reddit.com <p>Don’t have much facial hair? No problem! Simply utilize the hair atop your head to highlight your masculinity. We recommend shaving the area around your head-moustache or goatee to emphasize your gorgeous locks.</p> <h2>9. I’m a big fan of movies by DreamWorks</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-285.jpeg"/>Reddit.com  <p>DreamWorks Animation have produced some great movies over the years, but that doesn’t mean you can’t experience being a real-life cartoon yourself. You’re probably going to need a nice thick head of hair and beard for this one.</p> <h2>8. I’m an old customer of Bank of America</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-286.jpeg"/>Reddit.com  <p>You might be satisfied with the service at your local bank but we cannot guarantee your satisfaction after getting this crisscrossed beauty.</p> <h2>7. My role model is Fred from Scooby-Doo</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-287.jpeg"/>Reddit.com <p>Hair gel and bleach come together in imperfect harmony to create this masterpiece. While it may not make you the leader of your friends, it may make you say, “Let’s split up, gang!” to your hairdresser.</p>     <h2>6. Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-289.jpeg"/>Reddit.com <p>Your hairdresser may not have realized that you were referencing Spongebob Squarepants and not the sour, yellow fruit. At least they got some of the colour right. Avoid urge to actually jump into the sea afterwards, of course.</p> <h2>5. I just bought the latest iPhone</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-291.jpeg"/>Reddit.com <p>Apple product addicts can assure you that they will go to all lengths to express their love for the brand. We’re not sure if this haircut is going to fulfil that purpose or make you look like part of Apple’s newly launched iHuman series.</p> <h2>4. I want to make the ladies cry when they see me</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-293.jpeg"/>Reddit.com  <p>The tear-inducing characteristic of this haircut is not restricted to just one sex – careful not to cry yourself to sleep after getting this done!</p> <h2>3. Give me a nice old Golden Retriever tail</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-295.jpeg"/>Reddit.com  <p>Dogs are known to be man’s best friend but they’re better off the table when discussing potential haircuts. You may end up leaving the hairdresser with your tail between your legs.</p> <h2>2. Have you seen those race flag things?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-296.jpeg"/>Reddit.com <p>This one is multipurpose: not only used on the racetrack but can become a chess or checkerboard whenever you want it to. Ready, steady, think before you go!</p> <h2>1. I would like the classic zombie hands</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-297.jpeg"/>Reddit.com      <p>Fan of horror movies? No worries because now you can carry Halloween with you wherever you go. The ghastly fingers reach out over the sides of your head and stop just past your hairline, creating both volume and fear in others. Bonus points if your talented hairdresser can carve a single eye smack on the top of your head.</p>   <i></i>
