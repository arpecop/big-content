Unfortunately, school lunches have been notoriously pathetic in reality as well as in the media. However, many schools in America and everywhere else are now waking up to the importance of a good school lunch. It isn’t that expensive to manage healthy, filling, and delicious meals with a little budgeting.</p> <p>When it comes to school lunches from around the world, we think you would be surprised. Many countries offer quite a mouth-watering selection for their young minds in the middle of the day. Make sure you have a snack or two handy, because these school lunches are sure to set your mouth watering!</p> <h2>19. Argentina</h2>      <p> ¡Vengan por una Milanesa de Pollo en Torta+ o pidan Servicio a Domicilio ! 👌👌👌 #Milanesa #Irapuato #IrapuatoGto #TortaMas</p> <p>A post shared by Torta Más (@tortamas) on Oct 19, 2017 at 1:15pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>While Milanesa originated in Italy, it is usually associated with Mexican cuisine. In Argentina, this sort of meat is a staple in school lunches at several institutions. Other staples contain rice, potatoes, eggs and bread.</p> <p>There are certainly a lot of carbs here, but they’re balanced out nicely with protein from the meat and eggs. Since school going children need to use their brains for the larger part of the day, this combo is great! It would keep them healthy and satisfied, not to mention as sharp as a tack!</p> <h2>18. Japan</h2>      <p> dagens #japanlunch med världens bästa vänner @zikiposeidon och @miannis #26april</p> <p>A post shared by susanne gyllenlöf (@josannehbg) on Apr 26, 2017 at 7:13am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Japanese schools have the traditional cuisine that is shared by China and Korea. There is usually a sort of hot soup on offer. This whets the appetite but also fills one up so that the eater is satisfied at the end.</p> <p>In accordance with Japanese cuisine, there is also rice, fish or poultry, and salad. They usually shun sodas in favor of milk.</p> <p>Additionally, Japanese students are not allowed to bring home-cooked food to school. In fact, they have to eat school lunches instead of bringing anything from home. This is mostly the rule until they enter high school. There are also no places to get junk food from in school, like vending machines.</p> <p>For the most part, Japanese schools have canteens where the children get their lunches. They take the food to their classrooms and eat at their desks. Some may even wear white coats in order to protect their school uniforms.</p> <h2>17. The United Kingdom</h2>      <p> NO COOKING SHOOKING KINDA DAY! I must confess, Hungry Husband is definitely my biggest baby. I mean, after all, before having the children, I did refer to him as my baby; that's just the common trend nowadays right? Baby, babes 😍😘☺️ So basically he was like &quot;how comes I don't get school dinner type foods after work? I miss it too you know&quot; and so today was one of those kinda school dinner treats that we adults so miss from our childhood… well we definitely enjoy school dinner meals in the Hungry Hijabi HQ! How about you all? Ps don't even try looking for the veg! Fries are made from potatoes 😝 – – – – – 🍴🍴🍴🍴🍴🍴🍴🍴🍴🍴🍴🍴🍴🍴🍴🍴 #hungryhijabi #fishfingers #britishfood #delicious #schooldinners #inspiration #frozen #foodphotography #foodshare #foodphoto #foodstagram #foodpics #foodisfuel #instafood #periperi #instafood #vscocam #tasty #nom #foodfork #eeeeeats #buzzfood #f52gram #fries #yum #eat #dailyfoodfeed #pizza #bakedbeans #heinz ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️</p> <p>A post shared by H U N G R Y H I J A B I 🍴 (@hungryhijabi) on Oct 18, 2017 at 9:18am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>English schools are usually on a strict budget. The result is that their school lunches are mostly made up of cheap and filling items, which are incidentally also children’s favorites.</p> <p>Usually, school lunches in the United Kingdom consist of rice porridge, fried potatoes, salads, fruit, and some vegetables. The veggies mostly consist of carrots and/or peas. For dessert, some may be surprised by a waffle with some chocolate sauce or an English muffin.</p> <p>The main kind of food served here is fast food. While it may not be the healthiest choice, the kids sure are happy with their lot!</p> <h2>16. The United States of America</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1619.jpeg"/>PCS <p>Ah, the United States of America. This country is fast hurtling towards obesity, and the school lunches aren’t doing anything to prevent this. How can they, when pizza is at least a weekly staple in American school lunches?</p> <p>While there are fruit options as well as things like corn, chicken, and salad on the menu, these are not much better. This is because American schools mostly look at convenience and speed when planning school meals. Then, of course, there is the cost factor as well. The more a meal is processed, the longer it will keep without rotting.</p> <p>Hence, one can also find fries, burgers, and budgets provided for children in schools. Not just schools, but parents also have similar choices with the same reasons when they pack their kids’ lunches.</p> <h2>15. Turkey</h2>      <p> Kefir é um leite fermentado, ácido, produzido artesanalmente a partir de grãos que contém diversos microorganismos. Seu consumo regular pode trazer benefícios à saúde, como melhora do sistema imune e do funcionamento intestinal. Experimente! #kefir #dica #laticinios #jardins #alamedalorena #saopaulo #casasantaluzia</p> <p>A post shared by Casa Santa Luzia (@casasantaluzia) on Oct 18, 2017 at 12:31pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Turkey has an amazingly rich culture, so why should their food be any different? Turkish students hence regularly enjoy the cooling and refreshing drink that is called kefir. This is a white milk-based beverage enjoyed by adults and children alike.</p> <p>For strengthening brainpower and providing as much energy as possible, Turkish kids are also fed rye bread and fruits. These fruits include apples, pomegranate, grapes, etc. Walnuts are also a common side snack that serve to enhance brain function.</p> <h2>14. Thailand</h2>      <p> Vegetarianism in Southern Thailand 😐 #meh #ThaiSchoolLunch 12•9•15</p> <p>A post shared by Amanda Luukinen (@amandaluukinen) on Dec 8, 2015 at 8:23pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Thailand is known for its cuisine all over the world. Thai kids thus enjoy a variety of meals, including pork covered with sweet ‘n sour sauce. There is also a side of rice to fill them up. For dessert, there may be a pudding, mostly covered in banana leaves.</p> <h2>13. France</h2>      <p> Just had to share this from Harper's schools Facebook page. This is from there catered daily lunch! Ecole Franco-Américaine … #ihadasandwich #frenchschoollunch</p> <p>A post shared by Meghan Grimbert Design (@mgrimbertdesign) on Dec 3, 2015 at 2:41pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>French cuisine is one of the most popular and sought after ones in the whole world. Indeed, French restaurants are all the rage no matter where they are located. Maybe the finer levels of French food are beyond us, but we would love to get out teeth into these simple French school meals!</p> <p>While there would obviously be a variety of school meals in France, a traditional one is likely to include the basics. These include spinach, potatoes, bread, fish, and of course, cheese. The portions are plentiful because lunch is the most major meal during the day. Breakfast and dinner may be light, but lunch has to be sumptuous. The schools, thankfully, step right up in this case.</p> <p>In fact, many French schools have a lunch break that can be an hour long, even two. That’s how important good old lunch is! Students may even go home to have lunch during this break. When are other countries going to adopt this very wise practice?</p> <h2>12. Finland</h2>      <p> 20.9.2016 Kasvipalloja, remoulade kastiketta ja muusia. (Muusii tuli &quot;vähän&quot; xd) Ruoka oli kyl 5/5 Ja tosiaan olin perjantaina ja maanantaina kipee niin siks ei oo tullu kuvia. #finlandschoolfood#schoolfood#vegetarianschoolfood#kouluruokaa#vegetarian#kasvissyöjä#finland</p> <p>A post shared by Koulun kasvisruokaa (@kasviskouluruokaa) on Sep 20, 2016 at 2:05am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>When it comes to school meal planning, you can’t do much better than Finland. Finnish schools typically give several snacks to children whether they are in morning or evening school. Students are not allowed to go hungry, as this would greatly interfere with their quest for education.</p> <p>A canteen is provided in Finnish schools, where the students can sit and eat with a focus on their meals. They don’t usually eat in the classrooms. In fact, the canteens would have a variety of foods for lunch, from which the students can pick and choose.</p> <p>If a child has certain needs within his or her diet, the schools are there to help out. For instance, a child with diabetes would be offered sugar-free food, not fried or unwholesome stuff. The same would go for a Jewish child, who would be allowed to avoid non-kosher food. Hence, health problems and religious boundaries are greatly respected here. No winder Finnish schools are at the top of their game!</p> <p>Just for clarification, the Finnish school diet is very varied. It may include sauce, meatballs, salad, potatoes, and even muesli with other cereals.</p> <h2>11. Russia</h2>      <p> #школьнаяеда #школьныйзавтрак #утро #еда #яем #чтояем спбзавтрак #завтракшкольника #spb #eatspb #breakfast #schoolspb #schoolbreakfast</p>     <p>A post shared by Mila (@milagrebneva) on Dec 8, 2014 at 1:31am PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Russian schools offer breakfast to their students completely free of cost. We highly admire this move, since this is the most important meal, especially for growing children. The breakfast timings last from nine in the morning to noon.</p> <p>For lunch, many students have to pay separately. However, the menus for both breakfast and lunch are more or less the same. For instance, both meals would have buckwheat, sausages, and brewed tea.</p> <h2>10. Hungary</h2>      <p> Rizibizi rántott karajjal Igi módra kész💪😎 #budapestmood #budapestfood #hungaryfood #lunch #hungarylunch #budapestlunch #budapest</p> <p>A post shared by Igi_official (@igihungary) on May 30, 2017 at 1:56am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>True to its name, Hungary offers a huge lunch to its students. This could include baked beans, chicken, noodle soup, etc. Basically, anything that could fill up a child is served to Hungarian children. They aren’t offered anything elaborate for dessert, though. Nuts are more than enough for this purpose. Quite a healthy decision, we must say!</p> <h2>9. Israel</h2>      <p> My Israeli shnizel lunch #lunch #israelilunch #delish #hummus #tehini #israelisalad #laffah</p> <p>A post shared by michy silverstein (@michythepeachy) on Apr 4, 2017 at 9:53am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>An Israeli school lunch would typically contain some fresh fruit, which is highly commendable. However, we cannot say the same for the sweets that are provided alongside. Granola bars are another staple here. These may or may not be healthy, depending on the manufacture and different school policies.</p> <p>Israel’s cuisine does not typically contain bread like the Western world knows it. It is more based on flatbread, or pita bread. School lunches usually have this sort of bread with fillings like a wrap or a sandwich.</p> <h2>8. India</h2>      <p> IAMDATINGFOOD wishes you &amp; your family a very Happy &amp; Prosperous Diwali💥💥💥🌠🌠 May God bless you with all the happiness, joy &amp; wealth❤️ . . . . . . #staytuned on #iamdatingfood #rasgulla #sweettooth #desserts #dessertporn #followforfollow #festiveday #festive #diwali #festival #sweets #life #sweettooth#foodstagram #vscocam #vsco_hub #vsco #foodgasm #foodphotography #follow4follow #happiness #moments #enjoy #time</p> <p>A post shared by Delhi Foodblogger- Nikita (@iamdatingfood) on Oct 19, 2017 at 5:29am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Indian school lunches are usually served with the staples if Indian cuisine. This means that there may be some sort of rice or curry, with sambar and a traditional dessert. One of the favorite desserts in school lunches is rassgulla.</p> <p>Rassgulla are small white, ball-shaped sweets that may be served with a sweet kind of water. They are mostly served cold, and provide a refreshing taste.</p> <p>Additionally, Indian school lunches may be eaten while sitting on the floor. This is their way of eating in the traditional sense, though some school may prefer tables and chairs.</p> <h2>7. Iran</h2>      <p> #goodfoodie#kebab#irankebab#dinner#family#</p> <p>A post shared by De Rube (@rubmom) on Aug 30, 2016 at 11:07pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Iranian cuisine is delicious, and school lunches are often brought from home. However, the staples of both school and homemade meals are the same. This would include tomatoes, rice, and some sort of meat. The meat usually consists of a lamb kebab or chop.</p> <h2>6. South Korea</h2>      <p> #깻잎장아찌 #밥도둑 #반찬 #집밥 #밑반찬 #pickledsesameleaves #vegetablepickle #koreanfood #homecook</p> <p>A post shared by 우리집 집슐랭 myHomechelin (@homechelin) on Mar 30, 2017 at 3:56am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>The country of South Korea is excellent in the way it plans out its school meals. The biggest portions of the meal are usually comprised of soup, rice, or both. There are smaller portions for vegetables, salads, fruit and seafood. This is quite a healthy mixture of food for a growing and studious child.</p> <p>What’s more, there is even a measure especially taken for children who seem to be thin or underweight. They are given a measure of fish oil every day. Then of course, there is a healthy serving of kimchi, which is a traditional Korean pickle. More yummy options include cucumber and carrot salad, peppered octopus, savory pancakes, and thick soup.</p> <p>There is also a Korean delicacy which is sesame leaves filled with rice and honey sauce. Along with this, the soybean paste called doenjang is also available for more taste. Our mouth is watering already! Children usually finish off with a side of fruit for dessert. Grapes are mostly the preferred option.</p> <h2>5. Guatemala</h2>      <p> Pizza eggs for #breakfast is a #family #tradition. My son requests it almost every morning. This morning we had the delight of eating #homegrown #food. We picked the #tomatoes in a local families backyard. Look at that deep red – the flavors were bursting out of it. They grow their own veggies, herbs and even raise their own #chicken! My kids had a blast picking their own food and seeing the different color eggs. We got green and brown ones and the white one you see is from the store. #farmraised #farmraisedeggs #eggs #tortillaeggs #ilovemykids #ilovemyfamily #yum #healthyeating #healthylifestle #homemade</p> <p>A post shared by Rivka Lock Photography (@rivka613) on Sep 18, 2016 at 6:59am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>The school meals in Guatemala are mostly sparse, as in accordance with the school budgets. A lunch, for instance, may consist of nothing more than a single tortilla with a hardboiled egg. There may be a side of vegetables, usually tomatoes. Fruit juice or water serves as a drink.</p> <p>While this meal may not be as sumptuous or varied as those of different countries, it is quite nourishing and filling by itself. Not to mention quite a good idea for our clean eating plan!</p> <h2>4. Sweden</h2>      <p> #Skollunch#Likebackinthedays#Nostalgia#Bamba#swedishschoollunch#bambamat#Gratis</p> <p>A post shared by ❤🥊🥋🤼🏋❤ (@milenamccabe) on Feb 12, 2016 at 2:26am PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Sweden schools are also known for their excellent school systems. A typical Swedish school meal would consist of coleslaw, potatoes, and stew. In place of yeast of flatbread, there is a flat slab known as crispbread provided along with the meal.</p> <h2>3. Greece</h2>      <p> Mezze. #inourcoldcasenow #greekorzo #muhamarra #carrothummus #leekconfit #charredeggplant #cleaneating #eatyourcolors #littleflowercafe</p> <p>A post shared by Little Flower (@little_flower_cafe) on May 30, 2017 at 12:05pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>We don’t know about you, but the stuffed grape leaves in Greek school meals are making us plan a trip right now! The fruit ride continues with oranges, pomegranate seeds in Greek yogurt, and the like. For the main course, students may expect some baked chicken along with orzo. Orzo is a staple food which looks quite a bit like rice. Tomatoes and cucumbers provide a nice fresh salad.</p> <h2>2. Ukraine</h2>      <p> Dzień dobry 🍃 Zdecydowanie jesienne poranki trzeba w jakiś sposób sobie i najbliższym umilać 😊 Życzymy miłego jesiennego dnia 😊 #dziendobry #goodmorning #bonjour #breakfast #breakfasttime #sniadanie #sniadanko #instafood #syrniki #banan #masloorzechowe #instadziecko #dziecko #babyboy #instamatki #instapic #instagoods #yumm #yummy #delicious #delish #milegodnia #haveaniceday #autumn #october #jesien #wensday #jestembojestes</p> <p>A post shared by Ewa Wasielewska (@nikodem_i_mama) on Oct 11, 2017 at 12:08am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Ukrainian meals usually have potatoes as staples, which are probably mashed up. Along with this, sausages, cabbage and borscht make up the rest of the meal. For dessert, there is a kind of sweet pancake called syrniki.</p> <h2>1. Spain</h2>      <p> Typical #SchoolLunch in #Spain #SauteedShrimp #brownrice #gazpacho #peppers #bread #orange #spainschoollunch #spanishschoollunch #kids #children #Schools #nutrition #education #foodporn #food #cooking</p> <p>A post shared by Maryam SkaterMom Masadi (@maryamlovesjazz) on Feb 25, 2015 at 1:52pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Spain certainly has a wide variety of amazing cuisines, and they are not limited when it comes to school children. The meal in the illustration features lightly fried shrimp along with healthy brown rice. This would give it just the right amount of nutty and fishy taste.</p> <p>There are also several vegetables on the side, which would further vary the diet of school going children. These include peppers and gazpacho as well. For their carbs and fruit potion, some bread and fruit is also provided. Oranges are a main staple in Spain, which would obviously be there in any school meal.</p>     <p>So did this list inspire you to travel the world and eat nothing but school lunches? They’re so carried and exotic sometimes that they make us want to do just that!</p>   <i></i>
