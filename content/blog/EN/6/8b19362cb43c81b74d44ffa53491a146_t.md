There are countless tales of them rescuing shipwrecked sailors, sending gifts to people on the coast and playing with children. We flock to SeaWorld to see these wonderful creatures play in the water and find delight in the various interesting sounds they emit.</p> <p>The Ancient Greeks have immortalized them in their art and highly praised their altruism. However, there may an unexpected dark twist to these wonderful marine creatures, and it is not good news for humans.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2030.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Recently, marine experts have been finding telling evidence of dolphin violence towards their young. Off the coast of Scotland, a scientist watched in shocked silence as an adult dolphin repeatedly picked up and slammed a baby dolphin into the water for an hour. Off Virginia, nine bodies of dolphin calves were discovered, with broken bones and adult dolphin teeth marks.</p> <p>While infanticide is a common occurrence in wildlife, this behavior was unexpected in dolphins and, according to Dr. Dale J. Dunn, a veterinary pathologist, completely changed their “benign image of dolphins”.</p> <p>Other reports include those of dolphins attacking and killing porpoises. It all began in the 1990s, when the widespread global deaths of marine animals were reported. The theory that it was due to some sort of virus was discarded when a fresh body of a porpoise was discovered in 1996, its sides patterned with what were unmistakably adult bottle dolphin teeth marks.</p> <p>Out of the 105 porpoise bodies discovered between 1991-1993, 42 were proven to be due to dolphin attacks. Some attacks were even recorded by humans in videotape.</p> <p>Scientists theorized that that the dolphins saw the porpoises as rivals for food or as a threat to their young ones. But the similarity between the sizes of the porpoises and baby dolphins (the size difference is only about 1 foot) could not be ignored any longer. The killings of both porpoises and baby dolphins have continued over time, solidifying the case against the adult dolphins. “There are very few instances,” observes dolphin expert Dr. Read of Duke University. “When one mammal kills another when there is no risk of predation.” Most chillingly, it has been observed that the dolphins do not have a specific reason to kill – they simply enjoy doing it.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2031.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>But humans are still drawn to wild dolphins like moths to a flame. One of the dolphin’s interesting habits is turning its mouth upwards. Most people mistake this gesture as a welcoming smile, says marine biologist Trevor R. Spradlin. It is actually aggressive behavior, a “get away or I will hurt you” sign. Most dolphin attacks on humans occur because of them failing to read signs of potential aggression, such as jaw popping, tail slapping, pushing and charging. Approaching and engaging in physical contact stresses the animal out and forces it to attack.</p>     <p>How then are captive dolphins so friendly and welcoming to touching hands? It’s because they’re given a large amount of sedatives. However, this does not mean that cannot display the violent behavior observed in their wild counterparts.</p> <p>Reports of dolphins attacking humans are countless. A lonesome adult male bottlenose dolphin attacked a scuba diving couple off the shore of San Juan, Puerto Rico. It charged at the woman and attempted to mate with the man. The same dolphin bit another woman a few days following this incident. Others were also pulled into the water by dolphins and almost drowned. “I literally ripped my left leg out of its mouth,” claimed one of the victims.</p> <p>Two men were also attacked on the beach in San Paulo, Brazil. The wild dolphin, which initially appeared unaggressive, rammed one of them suddenly in the stomach. The man died soon of severe internal injury.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2032.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>What exactly makes these unpredictable animals so, well, unpredictable? For starters, dolphins have a brain the size of a human’s. Their intelligence has been proven to be above a dog’s and is equal to that of a chimpanzee. That is probably the reason they’re so good at picking up tricks and are the center of the show at every aquarium. They are highly social and known for hunting in aggressive pods. The common dolphin can grow to be 7 feet long and the bottlenose dolphin up to 12 feet and weigh up to 600 pounds. They are characterized by their protruding beak and sharp teeth.</p> <p>While dolphins have always mesmerized humans, nowadays they are attracting attention for a different reason. Many people believe that dolphins are, in fact, higher spiritual beings that hold the key to the meaning of the universe. Marie-Helene Roussel claims that dolphins “reach deep into our souls, opening the door to our hearts”. Roussel’s Delphines Center, along with others, routinely holds tours in which participants get to swim with and are “transformed by the love and higher intelligence” of the dolphins.</p> <p>However, marine experts discourage people from attending these kinds of tours, especially ones in which the guides lure the dolphins towards them with food. Not only is this practice illegal in the US but it can also provoke wild dolphins into exhibiting violent behavior.</p> <p>Another similar idea is offered by The Sirius Institute – “dolphin assisted birth”. In July, a couple from North Carolina are going to go ahead with this dream of theirs in Hawaii. The expecting mother is beyond ecstatic, claiming that this experience will make the bond between humans and dolphins deeper and allow them to coexist on the earth in peace.</p> <p>She plans to spend time before and after the birth with the dolphins and even give birth in the water in their presence. “(This will bring) peace, comfort and strength to the mother and baby”, she says. But dolphin experts disagree strongly, calling it the worst natural birthing idea ever.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2033.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>While the injury rate of humans by dolphins in captive environments remains fairly low, meeting dolphins in the wild is a high-risk activity. Dolphins in captivity are at least well-trained and are closely observed by experts for changes in behavior.</p>     <p>Wild dolphins, on the other hand, still continue to baffle marine scientists with their tendencies of gang rape, infanticide and cold-blooded murder. They advise avoiding unregulated or illegal tours and reading the signs of aggression. Just like watching birds or going on a safari, says Spradlin, you must apply the same kind of caution and respect to sea life.</p>   <i></i>
