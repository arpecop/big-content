Respect and mutual understanding go hand in hand when you’re in a relationship. If you find yourself crying most days because your man did you wrong again, then you need to open your eyes because honey it’s about time you see that you’re in a toxic relationship.</p> <p> </p> <p>Nobody said love was easy, but sometimes you have to open your eyes to realise that your beau is just not the right guy for you. Maybe you’re blinded by love but I’m the reality slap you’ve been waiting for. Here are a few red flags you need to look out for just to keep that sweet little heart of yours safe darling.</p> <h2>10.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1419.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>You know you’re dating a real jerk when he constantly compares you to other women especially his ex. This is not only downright disrespectful but can make you insecure about the littlest things. If you find your boo comparing you to other women whenever he gets the chance, you just have to open the door and show him the way out!</p> <h2>9.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1420.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>When a man is really in love, he will go out of his way to make you feel like you’re the most amazing woman in the world, and that you’re his top priority. If you find yourself constantly asking him to spend time with you, or can’t get him to talk about a future together, then sweetie you have to cut him loose. There is no such thing as ‘too busy’, we all have things going on in our lives but we make time for the ones we love. As for him not wanting to talk about the future, well it is plain and simple…he doesn’t want one!</p> <h2>8.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1421.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Yes, there is nothing wrong with a heated argument between lovers once in awhile, but that’s the thing about arguments and fighting in a relationship, you learn from them and try not to repeat the same mistake over and over again. Apologizing is one thing, but if your boyfriend keeps repeating the same mistakes again and again, then it just means his apology isn’t sincere! Now, if he tries to buy you little presents just to skip the conversation and shut you up, then girl run for the hills! He does not care about you or about what you have to say.</p> <h2>7.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1422.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>If this isn’t the biggest warning sign then I don’t know what is! A gentleman would never disrespect your friends or family. Before you jump into a relationship or go off and marry a guy like this just remember the inevitable you’ll be distancing yourself from your loved ones. Don’t worry it won’t be long because eventually, you will break up with this kind of guy, it never lasts. If he truly loves you, he’ll try to get closer to your friends and family, not build a wall between them and you.</p>     <h2>6.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1423.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>In the beginning, you might find it kind of cute that your boyfriend is so possessive of you and wants to know what you’re doing all the time. This cuteness will quickly turn into suffocation and have you feeling like you’re not your own person. You might start feeling like he owns you. The thing about a controlling partner is that he is so insecure about himself and can’t believe he bagged a hottie like you, that now he’ll do anything to make sure you don’t stray away.</p> <h2>5.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1424.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Name calling is cute, calling your girlfriend baby, sweetie, and honey is totally fine. But, when you start using hurtful and unflattering names to describe your girl, well what does that say about you? Your boyfriend should never be calling you names that are hurtful especially if he’s doing it on purpose just to put you down. That is the type of toxic behavior no one has time for.</p> <h2>4.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1425.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>If your boyfriend thinks it is okay to disappear after a fight and then continues to ignore for the next two or three days, think again missy! This is unacceptable behavior especially if he comes back acting like everything is fine. Ghosting your girl is never a good idea.</p> <h2>3.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1426.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>You know you’re in a toxic relationship when your partner doesn’t support your goals and dreams. He laughs at you whenever you bring up your future plans to get promoted at work or just shuts them down completely. This has nothing to do but more to do with him and what kind of person he is. He has probably never achieved anything worth having in his life except you, so now he feels the need to stomp on your dreams. Just because he couldn’t make his dreams come true doesn’t mean you can’t!</p> <h2>2.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1427.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>The key to a successful relationship is communication. If your boo looks bored or spaces out every time you’re having a conversation it means he probably doesn’t care for what you have to say. A guy that loves will pay attention to every word you have to say no matter how much of a snore-fest the conversation may be. If he cares, he’ll listen!</p> <h2>1.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1428.jpeg"/>Tapoos     <p>No matter how small or big, he’ll find a reason to fight over something throughout the day! This toxic behavior is going to keep you on edge and on your toes all the time. Your significant other is supposed to make your life easier, not harder. It’s time to kick him to the cut and move on to a new boo who knows how to treat you right.</p>   <i></i>
