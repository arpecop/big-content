The bizarre incident is enough to shake the conscious of any decent or even barely sane human being.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/c-users-mahad-downloads-21-11-01-jpg.jpeg"/>novizivot <p>Now of course child abuse is horrendous, deeply sickening and completely intolerable but the one thing that made this incident even worse than the action itself was the fact that Ashley was going to be baked alive in the oven by none other than her very own mother.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/c-users-mahad-downloads-21-11-02-jpg.jpeg"/>newsner <p>Thankfully for poor little Ashley, her father heard her scream from inside the oven and was able to rescue her from certain death. She was not unscathed in the incident however and suffered severe burns all over her body.</p>     <p>Ashley then had to undergo a whopping total of 28 operations as a result of the horrible event. The scars on her forehead and her arms are still clearly visible even to this very day.</p> <p>Melissa was sentenced to a lengthy jail term to the tune of 25 years behind bars on charges of attempted murder after Melissa came clean and admitted her crime to authorities. At first Melissa had tried to claim that it was not her fault and that it was an accident; that turned out be completely false.</p> <p>It was assumed that Melissa would serve out her entire term of 25 years, then a horrified Ashley came to know that her mother who almost managed to bake her alive, was trying to get paroled.</p> <p>Ashley was as can be expected, deeply shocked and horrified at the prospect of her mother being released from prison. She was determined that her mother should not be let out no matter what.</p> <p>The entire family however was not on her side. Her older sister Courtney thought that her mother should be let out of prison. Courtney was only eight years when her mother tried to bake her younger sister Ashley, in fact the whole thing had happened right in front of her eyes.</p> <p>She visited her mother frequently during her long incarceration and thinks that their mother has changed for the better. Courtney is a mother herself now and has children about the same age as Ashley was when she put in the oven to die.</p> <p>In the court both sisters came and presented their own points of view.</p> <p>”I don’t hate her, I don’t love her, I don’t want to meet her,” Ashley told the media in an interview. Ashley says that she is deeply worried about her young niece and nephew as to what Melissa might do to them if given the chance. Ashley says that she does not hate her mother and in her heart has forgiven her despite what she had tried to do to her. She has added though that even though she might have forgiven her for her actions she cannot bring herself to ever trust her mother again.</p> <p>Ashley is now in High school and a teenager and is 15 years old. She was taken in by her uncle and aunt who then raised her. Ashley now calls them her parents as opposed to her own parents.</p> <p>Ashley went on to add that her mother has never tried to make amends for her unspeakably horrifying crime.</p> <p>Despite the physical scars from the unfortunate incident young Ashley has tried to her best to put the horrifying incident behind her for good and has wants to become a pediatrician one day.</p>     <p>It is easy to understand her desire to keep Melissa behind bars after having gone through so much she should not have to live with the constant fear of a mother who has once tried to kill her already and might give it another go given the chance.</p>   <i></i>
