         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 3<p>The pursuit of happiness in life is a major struggle for us all. Whether we seek it in the throes of love, life or a sultry combination, it is a prerogative of our own selves that majorly influences our happiness levels in any given period of our lives. After all, it is a quote of the wise that we become what we do as we are consumed by our passions and habits. Science as well supports the fact that our moods and temperaments are closely interlinked with how we deal with situations or other people at different points in time. Besides, as the saying goes, if your habits aren’t being constructive in your life, they have a better shot at basically being more destructive in your life.</p> <p>So what exactly are these so called habits that dictate how and when you feel the way you feel. Whether these are intrinsically laid in you throughout life or are ones you are born is completely trivial in nature. But the crux if the matter is, how these small habits through their trickledown effect, snowball into larger more significant reasons that stem you from ever being completely happy. So today we will embark on a journey that will explore how these habits stop you from being happy in your life and how to channel your energy instead into synthesizing a more harmonious mindset for yourself. Read on!</p> <h2>Focusing on everything but your life</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-507.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Quite often, we focus so much on other people’s life and how amazing their successes feel to us that we forget our own life. It is imperative to mention here that while it is admirable by all cannons of logic to be happy for someone else’s achievements, we should never be carried away enough to forget to achieve our own. It is never too late to sow the seeds of your successes and water them to life. All of us have what it takes to unfold the greatness within and it is only natural that when we finally tap into this great wealth of greatness we have, incredible things take place. So step up and take the initiative for once, so you’re doing your own talking, thinking and deciding so you pave the passage to individual greatness.</p> <h2>Give up loads that hold you back</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-508.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>To soar to new heights that open you to new possibilities, drop down the baggage you believe burdens you from actualizing your true potential. Instead, adapt the traits in life that you believe will give you the wings (not Redbull necessarily!) to fly to your destinations. There will always be people and things that implicitly function to hold you back and instead, try to hold your ultimate wishes and dreams near and dear to your heart to help you really achieve them. Work hard to these goals and nothing can waver you away.</p> <h2>Eternal wait for pitch perfect moments</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-510.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It is a common fallacy that people often spend their entire lives for the perfect moment to bloom themselves. Little do they realize that this is a quintessential myth and there is no such thing as a perfect moment, but what you create yourself. So many people keep waiting for these moments so long, that they forget the true essence of working hard and thus end up never being completely happy with the way they are. So wake up and stop believing in these myths because the earlier you do, the closer you get on your path to happiness.</p> <h2>Create a strong desire to induce change and betterment</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-511.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Sometimes what we don’t realize is that there is a high level of interdependence between a willingness to struggle to make things better (and happier!) in the long run, and struggles you face that bog you down while getting there. You will find that most of life’s successes come not when you wait for them to come knocking on your door, but if you go wandering from door to door yourself. While you won’t be able to dig for perfection straight off the bat, happiness will be easy to come by and plentiful if you are willing to make the struggle of utilizing life’s imperfections to your own advantage.</p> <h2>Hand to mouth working</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-512.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>They say that if you do a job that you love, you will never have to work a single day of your life. As dreary and repetitive as it sounds, it only comes up over and over again because it is highly relevant in our lives. Working without it being your valid interest is a form of imprisonment in our minds. That does not mean you have to be super passionate about your job. But there must be some interest or desire to progress up the career or your job will not only help pay your bills only all your life, but will also make no significant contributions to your happiness levels ever.</p> <h2>Redefine yourself</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-513.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>For all those times when people told you to not be consumed by your work and not let it define you, disregard slightly and instead channel it in a way that can make you happier. Decide to do work that can define you in the long run so that the essence on what you do drops in synergy with your acts and this generates fulfillment and happiness over times. So find work that piques your interest and instills utter joy in your life, and success will follow in your footsteps.</p> <h2>Hate is a ‘drag-me-down’</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-514.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>‘Darkness never drives out darkness, only light can do that; hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that’, as Martin Luther King Jr. once said and it is for that very reason that we cannot carry this extra baggage around. Hate is an overwhelming feeling and can possess the best of us completely to bend the way we think and work. Often people’s entire life and thinking gets consumed by hate which makes it a dangerous and powerful exponent of human negativity. And it is for this prime reason that hate is an undoing to happiness and must be avoided at all costs.</p> <h2>De-clutter your mind</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-515.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The thing with despising anything or anyone is that it forever takes up some part of your mind and thus every time you seek to make an important decision or decide to indulge in happy activities, you will go through the negativity first which can be a total buzz kill. Instead keep your head down and never open up to negativity in your pursuit of happiness.</p> <h2>Holding fears and worries too close</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-516.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>We all have priorities that we like holding close. Whether this is morale boosting to us or not, being safe is a part of human nature and so is being pessimistic and cautious. But the fact of the matter is that seldom does the intrinsic worry in us come to fruition and this only proves that being this kind of person mostly serves to tense us only. So realizing it now is the way to go as you can drop all that hair graying worry and focus on what makes you happy in life. After all, the amount of opportunities you must have destroyed because of being hesitant is endless and the least you can do is look forth to the ones to come.</p>     <h2>Self reflection can make or break happiness</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-517.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If and when you ever look back at life and realize that some things were better left given up and other better suited to be pursued more thoroughly that the share they got. But clamping a prison ball on your own ankles is a mistake the best of us make so it is completely natural for you to reflect and learn, but it is also primal that you don’t suffer for past misery but instead back in happiness of learning for a better tomorrow that you can live. Its just a simple matter of letting go the ages of negativity that held you down.</p> <h2>Just let it go</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-518.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Letting go is a hard concept to come to if you are the sort that even reveres painful memories fondly as those that made you the person that you are today. But it is one that is pivotal to making you a genuinely happy person. While it is understandable that many of us choose reflection as a viable trade off to happiness, it is vital to note that happiness is the sole feeling you wish you had by the end when you look back at life is the sole thing you cannot let go of. Other than that, pretentiousness, jealousy, spitefulness and hatefulness are just some of the negativity that you need to let go of to be a happy person.</p> <h2>Never settle on negativity</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-519.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>There are good days and there are bad days. But often it is best to leave it at that and not dwell on it over the long term. How these times affect your life is completely dependent on how you wish to apportion it a share in your life and influence your decisions. It is completely normal and even wise to learn from these setbacks but to let the piggyback you into doom is failure to ever be happy again. Never try to give undue importance to this negativity by allowing it to be a bigger part of your life.</p> <h2>Learn endlessly out of life</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-520.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It may just be one of those things that you only learn through a life of living, but take our word for this happiness tip. Have had an abusive partner? Stop going back. A job you don’t like? Hand in your resignation. Live in a place that you despise? Move ASAP. Point is you get to choose how your life is and don’t have to stick with bad decisions necessarily. How you deal with these is completely moldable and up to you. How you handle these lessons dictates your reluctant happiness later in life. Endurance is the key at the end of the day.</p> <h2>On the constant search for contentment</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-521.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Whether it is fleeting or enduring contentment that you seek, there will be a lot of surprises and disappointments to endure. Through them your mind finds peace and stability that resonates through your happiness. Life’s fleeting abruptness may throw your life into a spiraling frenzy, but that by no means ensures that physical means will provide you with lasting happiness, so the best bet is to lower your expectations.</p> <h2>Change comes in small increments</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-522.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Drops combine to make rapid rivers and it is very alike in holding true for initiatives. Small steps are the way to go as the combine to snowball into major steps. It is usually impossible to the point of being a deterrent to make a big change straight away so the process of small collective changes is lighter in terms of being arduous and dredging. With smaller steps, more concentrated and focused objectives or people can be focused on to help paint a wider picture on the whole. Start close and start small to make the biggest of impacts- while maintaining your happiness at the same time.</p> <h2>Learn to work around problems</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-523.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>At times direct confrontation is a very bad habit to solve problems and it is better to solve the issues by association. For example to better your mood try to improve the situations and moods of people or circumstances around you to solve it. Smiles are perhaps the greatest component to prove this example. With their contagiousness, happiness is bound to flow around. In this subtle manner, you can influence the proliferation of happiness en masse just with the thoughtfulness of being resourcefully wise.</p> <h2>Letting go of hurtful people</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-524.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Sometimes walking away from hurtful is just as hurtful in nature. But this is not attributed to the lack of your care, but the lack of theirs. So it is only natural that you are supposed to gravitate away from each other in the longer run and resisting this natural tendency can only end up hurting you more and stemming your flow of happiness. It may be a bitter pill to swallow but this habit of keeping people around despite their hurtful nature can be nothing but hurtful for you. There is no gain out of impressing these people or trying to earn their niceness, since they have made up their mind once. Disregard and move on. It is for the best.</p> <h2>Being stuck on superficial beauty</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-525.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The best part about genuinely happy people is how they disregard superficial beauty regardless of how infatuating it can be. The world was made on internal beauty and there is no reason that you should try and change that. Be free in your ability to admire beauty but never fall for something or someone just based on looks. Because beauty is always more than just skin deep.</p> <h2>Find beauty and happiness in your identity</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-526.jpeg"/>Shutterstock     <p>Some people like green and other blue, some love cats and other dogs, some are 4 feet tall and others towering over 6 feet. The point is that there is no use identifying perfection of ideal circumstances to one single trait. Your uniqueness is your strength and it will always be your beauty so be proud of it and be happy knowing you stand out.</p>   <i></i>
