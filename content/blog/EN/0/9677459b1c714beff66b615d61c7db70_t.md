It becomes even more essential once the couple decide to live together since they will be sharing their lives with the other person.</p> <p>However one may deem it as a stepping stone towards serious long-term relationship, if not given proper thought you may end up in a bad relationship. You may realize there were a lot of differences which you previously overlooked and only now are you getting familiar with them.</p> <p>This situation leads to animosity between the couple and the eventual parting of ways. So it would be a lot easier and save you a lot of trouble later on if you but knew what are your partner’s set of expectations from you.</p> <p>Each zodiac sign has different personality traits and if you are interested in moving in together at least learn about the different expectations you both will be having. It is often the case that one zodiac sign may thrive in a certain situation while it may not be acceptable to the other sun sign.</p> <p>To avoid these troubles, you need to know whether you both as a couple will live together peacefully or is it just too difficult a task. So before moving in together we have compiled a list of the most polar opposite sun signs for cohabitation.</p> <h2>6.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Although both these sun signs share the same ruling planet of Mercury which makes them both adept at communication, the question of living together is a whole different story altogether.</p> <p>Gemini are more of a thinkers and sharing ideas and communicating what they feel about a particular subject. On the other hand Virgo are inclined more towards practical side of things and they have little tolerance for ideas not put into practice. If both of these sun signs decide to move in together Virgo will eventually lose their cool and decide to abandon the relationship.</p> <p>Gemini may use their strong communication skills to persuade and convince Virgo otherwise but it will only work for a short period of time, not sustainable for a long term commitment.</p> <h2>5.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Although both share passion as one of the strongest trait between them and the physical intimacy is something they both look forward to but both are head strong. Leo with their excessive need to have a partner which will pamper their ego and admire them unconditionally and Scorpio feeling it a one sided affair as they feel their love is not being reciprocated.</p> <p>Both will become confrontational instead of realizing the conflict of interests between them and resolving them. The perception that the other is not caring and understanding will take roots. Each will be convinced of their opinion on the matter without coming to a compromise.</p> <p>Hence it is better to turn down the opportunity of living together than to give it a chance and split later on.</p>     <h2>4.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Both these sun signs are very ambitious and goal oriented which may be the reason they attract each other initially. However Capricorn are more calculated, deliberate on a matter in detail and are very methodical in their approach. On the other hand Aries is always in a rush to achieve their objective.</p> <p>No doubt Aries is just as determined as a Capricorn but they will be prone to taking rash decisions and not giving matter too much thought before diving right into it. The most annoying thing for a Capricorn is the lack of collective decision making on the part of Aries as they will often not take their partner into confidence before an important matter.</p> <p>So whether it is financial decisions or matters regarding career Capricorn will perceive Aries as irresponsible and grow weary of them.</p> <h2>3.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-3.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>These both signs should never think about moving in together at all no matter how much chemistry they may share they have contrasting set of values. Taurus people are more towards relationship stability and very stubborn about the way things should be in a relationship.</p> <p>They are very loyal and loving but this makes them too possessive of their partner. Sagittarius on the other hand doesn’t like to be tied down as they don’t conform to a certain timetable and look for spontaneity and living in the moment. This adventurous spirit of Sagittarius will obviously make the settled Taurus nervous and uncomfortable and they both will lack that feeling of comfort you derive from a relationship.</p> <h2>2.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-4.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Cancer are the most emotionally sensitive of the zodiac signs and when they have decided to move in with their partner they will make every attempt to make their home as full of love as possible. Libra on the other hand do appreciate their partner’s efforts but also want an active social life at the same time. They might opt to hang out with friends and enjoy outside the home which a loyal and emotional Cancer may view as an insult to their loving efforts.</p> <h2>1.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-5.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Both are the water signs and there will be a definite chemistry between the two since both are very romantic and fantasize about their relationship. It is all well and good until they both start to face the real world problems of living together. The little dream both shared will not be able to withstand the responsibilities life will throw at them.</p>     <p>Since both would expect the other to come to their aid and their will be an obvious perception that you both no longer understand each other’s need.</p>   <i></i>
