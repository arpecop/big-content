You will need:</p>  An old CD A knife or blunt edged object A lighter  <p>Bet your friends that they can’t pop a bubble that you will conjure from a CD. They will be skeptical but use that to your benefit by sealing the deal. Once the bet has been sealed, use a blade or anything with a blunt edge to scrape away the metal film on the CD. There is no need to go all over the CD but just a few centimeters would do the trick.</p> <p>With a lighter apply flame to the cleared area and continue heating it until the surface begins to look like shiny, molten plastic. Quickly blow into the molten puddle but be careful to not touch your lips to it. You will either get a small or large unpoppable bubble, depending on how well you managed to melt the plastic. There is no way anyone can pop this bubble or tube of air, collect your winnings and head home.</p> <h2>Toothpick star</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-242.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>Not only is this trick simple and easy to pull off, it is also a guaranteed winner. Your friends and family will be amazed and will wonder if a little magic is involved. You will need:</p>  5 wooden toothpicks A straw Some water  <p>Bet your friends that you can turn a ten-point star made of wooden matches into a five-point star without so much as touching a single toothpick. No one will believe that you can do it and that’s where you close the deal.</p> <p>Start by breaking the toothpicks in half but not all the way through. Make sure that while they are bent in the middle, the two halves are still attached. Arrange them in a star shape with the open prongs towards the outside and the bent centers on the inside.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-243.jpeg"/>weirdsciencekids <p>Now, take a couple of drops of water with the straw and drop them right in the center of your ten-point star. The toothpicks will begin to move because of the water moving outwards and the arrangement will begin to resemble a five-pointed star.</p> <h2>Novel shuffle</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-244.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>You can make some quick cash with books lying around house and it doesn’t involve selling them. Bet your friends that they can’t pull apart two books with their pages shuffled into each other. It is more than likely that they will laugh it off and take on the challenge. You will need:</p>      Two paperbacks Your hands  <p>Open the books and place them side by side so that one of their sides is one on top of the other. Now start to turn the pages of the two books while alternating between the two. The pages should more or less look like two shuffled decks of cards by the time you are done. Now offer your friend the shuffled books and ask them to pull them apart. They will give it all they have but will be unable to do so. The reason behind this neat trick lies in science. The pages of the books have great friction working on them and it will be next to impossible to pull them apart.</p> <h2>Jumping toothpicks</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-245.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>You can never go wrong with this genius little trick which will make your friends believe that you harness static electric power. You will need:</p>  Two wooden toothpicks A place for one of the toothpicks to hang over, a table corner, ledge, over a book etc. Your head  <p>Rub one of the toothpicks against the back of your head to make your friends believe that you have electrical prowess. For this to work out, make sure you are holding the toothpick between your index finger and the thumb. Bring it closer to the other toothpick which is hanging off a surface halfway. As soon as it you touch it slight with the first toothpick, the second toothpick will jump as if been struck by electricity. The trick lies in your index finger. When you bring the first toothpick closer to the second one, flick your index finger slightly. Your hand will be shielding the index finger making the flick invisible. Your friends will be in awe, we can bet!</p> <h2>Balancing a coin</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-246.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>Bet your friends that they can’t balance a coin on the tip of a playing card balanced on top of a glass of water. You will need:</p>  A playing card A coin A glass of water  <p>Set the arrangement up for them and then watch them as they fail miserably. Once they give up, swoop in and fill the glass with water till the very top. Now place the card over it and very smoothly balance a coin on its edge without causing the card to tip over. The surface tension of the water will grip and hold the card in place.</p> <h2>Draw a perfect circle</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-247.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>This may need some practice beforehand on your part but it is simple and easy enough to pull off with a hitch. Bet your friends that they cannot draw a perfect circle on a paper using nothing other than pencil and their fingers. You will need:</p>  A paper A pencil  <p>They will end up making anything and everything but a circle. Take the paper and pencil and place the knuckle of your pinky finger where you want the center of the circle to be. Lightly touch the pencil to the paper and keeping your knuckle in place, simply turn the paper. Viola!</p> <h2>A strong blow</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-248.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>You will need:</p>  An empty shot glass A penny      <p>Place a penny flat inside a shot glass and ask your friends if they can take it out without lifting the shot glass or using their hands. They will try and fail. Proceed to amaze them by leaning near the edge of the glass and blowing into it with all you have. The penny will fly out and with some practice you may even be able to catch it on its way out.</p>   <i></i>
