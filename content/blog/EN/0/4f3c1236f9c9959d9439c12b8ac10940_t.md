         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -2<p>A shocking number of people opt for plastic surgeries and cosmetic procedures every year. Whether they are celebrities or common folks like us, everyone seems to correct, alter and enhance something they don’t like about themselves. Whether it is for a genuine reason, out of habit or for the pursuit of perfection, not everyone gets away with. Here are some plastic surgeries that went so wrong, they shouldn’t have ever happened.</p> <h2>6. Renee Zellweger</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1120.jpeg"/>via wikipedia <p>Renee Zellweger shot to fame with Bridget Jones’s diary and the audiences couldn’t get enough of this beautiful, American sweetheart. Somewhere along the line, Zellweger disappeared altogether and we didn’t see any more of her on the big screens or the smaller ones.</p> <p>We speculated for some time but then, as life goes, we forgot about Bridget Jones and moved on. However, in 2014 Zellwegger made an appearance at ELLE Women in Hollywood Awards looking… different. Naturally, people attributed her changed appearance to having gone under the knife. Zellwegger shot down all these rumors claiming that people change and mature as they grow older. She even penned an op-ed for The Huffington Post titled “We Can Do Better.”</p> <p>She writes, “Maybe we could talk more about why we seem to collectively share an appetite for witnessing people diminished and humiliated with attacks on appearance and character and how it impacts younger generations and struggles for equality.”</p> <h2>5.

Her transformation and feminization has been a long, silicone enhancement riddled path on which she started out idealizing the likes of Marilynn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield. Resembling a modern day Jessica Rabbit, Amanda Lepore claims to have one of the most expensive bodies in the world. She has become a toast of Manhattan life where she makes appearances at clubs, models for some of the top agencies in US and internationally and also performs burlesque. Unlike a lot of people who get work done, Amanda Lepore flaunts hers confidently, “I sometimes think about doing getting more stuff done to my body, but not really… Plastic surgery is for when you don’t like things… Everything I’ve got already looks so good.”</p> <h2>4. Dennis Avner</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1121.jpeg"/>via Wikimedia <p>Taking the conventional cosmetic surgery a bit further Dennis Avner, or Catman, held the world record for “most permanent transformations to look like an animal”. He had more than 14 surgical procedures and body modifications to look like his spiritual animal, the Stalking Cat.</p> <p>In addition to just focusing on his face and bone structure and to modifying them, Avner also had his teeth morphed into fangs.
