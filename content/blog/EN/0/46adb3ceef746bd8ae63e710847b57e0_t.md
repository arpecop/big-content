Who cares about how much sugar you like in your morning coffee or how long you take in the shower, right? Most of us believe things like these are up to personal preference but psychologists disagree. “(Things like) Taste can offer us a doorway into people’s lives,” says Sam Gosling, a psychologist at the University of Texas at Austin and author of <em>Snoop: What Your Stuff Says About You</em>. “Taste reveals a lot about what someone values and needs to fill their life with meaning.”</p> <p>Similarly, our daily habits are a natural indicator of our personality types. We subconsciously act the way we are and, when this is pointed out, we can also change our behaviour consciously. Here are 5 things you may be doing daily without giving them a second thought that determine your characteristics.</p> <h2>5. Drinking</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-226.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Note where you place your eyes when you take a sip of water, coffee or tea. If you look into the cup, it means you are thoughtful yet determined. You tend to get lost in your thoughts and maintain a strong will in all situations. However, if you look over the edge of the cup, such as maintaining eye contact with another person, it shows that you are carefree. You trust others easily and rely on their opinions.</p> <h2>4. Eating</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-227.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Do you eat fast or slow? If you tend to eat slowly, it shows that you are able to enjoy and appreciate every moment of your life. You are also used to everything being under your control, leaving you relaxed. If you eat quickly, you are focused, ambitious and open to anything new. The downside? You are very impatient and tend to stress out often. And if you like trying out new dishes, it means that you are a lover of risks and adventures.</p>     <h2>3. Resting</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-228.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>What do you like to do in your free time? What activity relaxes and destresses you the most? If you like to pick up a book and read, it means that you are understanding, compassionate and have a lot of empathy. And if you like to watch TV or play video games, you are opinionated and argumentative.</p> <h2>2. Bathing</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-229.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com  <p>Do you prefer baths or showers? Cold or hot? Quick or long? Psychologists say that if you like taking lengthy baths, it may indicate that you are calm and stable. It is difficult to throw you off balance. If you take your shower quickly, you are caring, thoughtful and put other people’s needs above yours. If you brush your teeth while showering, you are a good multitasker but lack patience. If you like to sing in the shower, you have many friends and are sociable.</p> <p>If you like your showers ice cold, you like to prove your point and are easily agitated and stressed out. And if you tend to daydream while bathing or showering, there’s a good chance that you have a strong artistic sense and a well-developed sense of humour.</p> <h2>1. Toilet paper</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-230.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com     <p>You’d better believe it. Even the way you place your toilet paper in your bathroom tells something about your personality. If your roll is over, it means that you are dominant in your relationships. People look to you as a leader and you have the necessary skills to back up that trust. If your roll is under, you are submissive in your relationships. You are more comfortable being led rather than leading others.</p>   <i></i>
