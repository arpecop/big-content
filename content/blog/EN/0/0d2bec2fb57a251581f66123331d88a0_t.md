Just close your eyes and stretch out your arms and legs a little. If not, then at the very least take your eyes off the screen for the said time.</p> <h2>Blinking for 2 Minutes.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-692.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>This will help regulate blood circulation inside the eyes.

Then move it back slowly, keeping your eyes on the pen at all times.</p> <p>Repeat this action for a minimum of 10 times. Do it on a regular basis and you will surely experience a significant improvement in your concentration level.</p> <h2>Massaging the Temples.</h2> <p>Massage your temples in small circles using your thumbs.

In the process, try to visualize a pleasant memory—one that helps ease your mind—while keeping your shoulders and neck relaxed. The more frequently you do this, the more likely you are to train your eyes to reduce muscle tension, with subsequent benefit to your sight.</p> <h2>Swinging.</h2> <p>Stand looking straight ahead, with your feet positioned about 12 inches apart. Now, rotate your whole body to the left, throwing your weight onto your left foot while you allow your right heel to rise from the floor. Keep your shoulders and neck straight.</p> <p>When you swing to the opposite side, shifting your weight to your other foot, your eyes will cover a 180° arc.

You can also focus on an object that is five to 10 feet away for 10-15 seconds.</p> <p>Then, focus on an object that is 10-20 feet in front of you without moving your head. Focus on the object for 10-15 seconds. After 10-15 seconds, refocus on your thumb. Practice this activity five times to improve your concentration as well blood circulation in the eyes.</p> <h2>Flexing.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-700.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Face straight ahead and look up as far as you can without moving your head. Then look down. Repeat this a few times. Next, look at your top right, go as far to the edge of your vision as you can. Then bottom left, and alternate the two again. Finally, look top left and alternate with bottom right a few times.</p> <p>This simple exercise will help you stretch your extra ocular muscles. It gets you out of the habit of just staring 1 to 2 feet in front of your face which is what most people tend to do at their screens all day long.</p> <h2>Drawing Figures.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-701.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Try to draw different figures with your gaze. Start with simple shapes before moving on to more complex ones. This will improve the flow of intraocular fluid between the eyes. This is recommended as one of the best eye exercise available.</p> <h2>Eyeball Movement.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-703.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p><strong>Close your eyes and slowly move your eyeballs up and down.</strong> Repeat this five to ten times.
