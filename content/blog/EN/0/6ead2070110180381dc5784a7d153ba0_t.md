This is the most prestigious gig a model can land and it opens doors of countless opportunities for them. It doesn’t hurt that these shows pay a handsome amount as well. VS shows are known for their expensive (and revealing) outfits, an amazing entertainment lineup and events filled with colors and loads of drama. Being awarded Angel’s Wings are an even bigger deal which is given to the most highly regarded and valuable models in the show. Only 14 winged angels walked the runway during the VS Fashion Show of 2016. Following is a list of top 10 highest earning Victoria’s Secret Angels.</p> <h2>10.
