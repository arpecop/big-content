But ain’t nobody got time for spending hours in front of the mirror before heading out each day for that perfect, flawless look. Here are 19 makeup and beauty hacks which will have you looking your best in absolutely no time.</p> <h2>18. No makeup look</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2051.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>Do you want to look naturally beautiful but of course not without makeup? CoverGirl Global Creative Design Director Pat McGrath has a clever trick for a fresh, flawless look. Apply foundation to your face like you do in routine but wipe it off lightly with a tissue off the cheeks before applying your blush. “It brings life back to your cheeks and realness back to your skin,” says McGrath. The cheeks looked naturally blushed and you won’t get the fake, cakey feel at all. Here is how you can nail the no makeup look.</p> <h2>17. Mascara for naturally long lashes</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2052.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>Count your blessings and make sure this one if number 1 on the list because, girl, you be special! Long lashes are one of the most sought after beauty feature and when you have naturally long lashes, you don’t need to worry too much about making the stand out. Just the slightest bit of mascara magic would do. Chanel celebrity makeup artist Kara Yoshimoto Bua says, “The trick to sexy natural lashes is to get the thickness into the base of the lashes and taper them naturally to the ends, as opposed to chunky, thick ends.” Sweep your wand outwards and upwards when applying mascara and let the magic happen!</p> <h2>16. Use powder for greater volume</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2053.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Not all of us are blessed with the lash volume of Kimmy K. or Kylie Jenner. But there is a common household product which can boost your lashes and have them giving that perfect faux look we all sigh over. Curl your lashes with your curler and then apply a single coat of your regular mascara. The take a Q-tip and dab some powder onto the lashes very lightly. You can use baby powder as well as loose setting powder. Apply another coat of mascara and voila! You are camera ready. Look perfect, xoxo.</p> <h2>15. Use mascara as eyeliner</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2054.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You are heading out and the liner has run dry? Or, in my case, your kid has chucked it somewhere and you have more chances of finding the lost city of Atlantis rather than the eyeliner? Worry not because we have you covered (literally) with this neat trick. Take a thin liner brush and give it a light dunk in the mascara tube. Continue on applying the eye liner as usual. You can thank me later.</p> <h2>14. Perfect Cat eyes</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2055.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You might need a few practice runs with this one before you can get it just right. But don’t worry you’ll nail it sooner than you think. Lower your eyelid and draw a line at an angle upwards from the outer corner of your eye. Draw the line a tad bit longer because once you open the eyelid it will look smaller. Now starting at the tip of the line you have drawn, make a triangle finishing just outside your iris on the lash line. Fill in the triangle and connect with your lash line by applying the eyeliner as you usually would. You can also use a tape to draw a flawless line.</p> <h2>13. And while we are on mascaras…</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2056.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>For a more natural look, hold the wand vertically and only touch the tip with the lower lash line. Apply a heavier coat on the upper lash line, still holding the wand vertically. It is a very simple yet one of the best hacks you could use to give your lashes that “pop”!</p> <h2>12. Save that spoon!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2057.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Use disposable plastic spoons to apply mascara without making a mess. Hold it over the upper lashes or under the lower ones and apply swift, thick coats. You can also try these shadow shields which work wonders for a non-messy mascara and eye shadow application.</p> <h2>11. Those dark circles though</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2058.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>You know you have mastered the art of makeup once you can hide those dark circles like a pro. For this, the much-revered makeup artist Bobbi Brown suggests prepping the under-eye area with super hydration cream or drops so that you can smoothly apply layers of makeup without giving a caked up look. “Apply a corrector to cover the purple or green tones in the skin, then follow with a concealer that is one to two shades lighter than your foundation,” she says, “Finally, set the under-eye area with a pale yellow powder to help it last longer and prevent creasing.”</p> <p>[related: how to get rid of dark circles fast]</p> <h2>10. Know your face before you blush it</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2059.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>Not all faces are the same. Know the type of face you have before applying your blush. The reason behind this is to better accentuate your cheekbones and bring them to notice. Blush helps contour and define your face while adding some color to it.</p>     <h2>9. The scotch tape hack</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2060.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>If you are as bad at winged eyeliners as me then you will make the most of this little beauty hack. Simply put some scotch tape towards the outside edge of where your waterline ends and angle it according to the wing angle you want. Adjust angles on both the eyes and trace a line. Remove the tape gently and fill in the details. You can make it as thick and thin as you like. Learn more here.</p> <h2>8. Highlighting the eye</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2061.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>To achieve a look which make your eyes look brighter and more prominent, especially when opting for the no-makeup-look, try this little beauty tip. Apply the lightest shade on your eye palette to the inner corner of the eye, center of the eye lid and just under the highest part of your brow bone. Blend smoothly for a fresher look.</p> <h2>7. Smell nice throughout the day…</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2062.jpeg"/>freepeople <p>… with this way of applying perfume. Instead of spraying yourself from head to toe and smelling like a perfume shop threw up on you, spritz and dab it on your pulse points: behind the ear, inside the wrists, base of throat, behind the knees and inside the elbows. You’ll smell heavenly throughout the day, tried and tested.</p> <p>[related: 10 best new Fall 2017 scents]</p> <h2>6. Brushing lips?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2063.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Yes, right after you brush your teeth, morning and night, give that pout a light scrub with your toothbrush (after you have removed your lipstick obviously!) as well. This way, your lips will lose dead skin and stay super soft. You could also DIY a homemade lip scrub and make lip scrubbing a part of your daily beauty regime. Believe me, there is no downside to that.</p> <h2>5. Instant cheekbones</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2064.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Not all of us are born with cheekbones worthy of a career on the Paris Fashion Week runway. However, you might just be able to fake it. The cheekbones, I mean. Celebrity makeup artist Mally Roncal shares a trick of the trade and suggests sweeping “a sheer shimmer powder along the top of your cheekbones and just under your temples”. Next, pout and find the hollow of your cheeks and dust a nude blush or bronzer lightly in the area. Smile and dust a peach blush using the “cinnamon bun method”. Cheekbones on the go!

DIY fan brush</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2065.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>I had my eye on this gorgeous fan brush by Morphe since, like, forever. However, I wasn’t too sure if I wanted it because there was actually a need for it or just because it looked so pretty. So, I came across this hack: take a bobby pin and stick it just above where the bristles of your blush or contour brush begin. Start fanning away!</p> <h2>3. That perfect pout</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2066.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>To get the perfect pout, first moisturize your lips. I tend to apply my lipstick towards the very end so I leave a light coat of Vaseline on lips right after I start on my makeup. By the time I come around to doing the lips, they are soft and hydrated. Draw an X on your upper lip with your pencil liner. Now using that X as a guide, apply your lipstick. Work your way from the middle towards the outside for a flawless finish. To make the lipstick last longer, pat the lips lightly with some baby powder or setting powder and apply another thin lipstick layer over it.

Cutting eyelashes doesn’t work.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2067.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>This is a myth and it has been busted so badly, it won’t bother resurfacing again. Cutting the lashes at the tips does absolutely nothing for their length. The lashes might not even grow to the length they were before. There is also a very good chance the trimmed lashes won’t have a naturally curved look at all when they finally grow.</p> <h2>1. Beat that tricky liquid liner</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2068.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com     <p>Liquid eye liners look great! But they are the trickiest of all products and not even the most experienced among us would opt for it for a ‘quick’ look. Avon Global Creative Color Director Jillian Dempsey, comes to rescue and suggests using a slightly lighter shade of eyeliner pencil to draw the eye with. “This trick lets you make sure the lines are even and accurate before next applying the liquid liner directly on top of the ‘practice’ line.”</p>   <i></i>
