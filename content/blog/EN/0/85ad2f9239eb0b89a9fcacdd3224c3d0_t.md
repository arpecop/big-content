Everyone born into this world is different in their own way. But there are a few that will always leave you with something to cherish. I’m talking about that friend you have who always pops up out of nowhere with a smile to light up your day. I’m talking about the people who are born with an intrinsic motivation of giving off positive vibes into their surroundings. They can be kind to you even in the worst of circumstances; if you crashed their car or slept with their boyfriend. Their hearts are filled with compassion and they aren’t afraid of letting that shine through. They don’t fake it.</p> <p>They’re just genuinely that nice! But this world can be cruel. Its toxic nature has the tendency to affect people’s lives. In the case of the kind-hearted, the effects are usually resoundingly negative. All of their good deeds account for nothing when they aren’t allowed to rave in the glory of all the happiness they produce. It’s quite sad that those who live to spread happiness do not receive that sentiment. Here are the reasons why these unlucky beacons of hope don’t get to be happy themselves.</p> <h2>10. They give way too much</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1259.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>Kind people give, they tend to give each and everything they have just to make those around them as comfortable as possible. There is literally no limit to what they’re willing to give up just to make others smile. They crave that sense of fulfillment. They like to believe in others and don’t expect anything in return. That’s just how they work. Even if they have a crucial exam in the morning, they will focus on helping you study rather than worry about themselves.</p> <p>Unfortunately, no one ever reciprocates that generosity when it comes to giving back, and they’ll be okay with that too. Until times get tough. When they’re stuck in a ditch and looking for a helping hand there will be no one in sight. They long for the same compassion they showed, but that’s when they realize things aren’t the same. The people they spent sleepless nights for don’t care for their happiness at all.</p> <h2>9. They have high humanistic expectations</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1260.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>It’s pretty common that a good human being will expect other human beings to be good too. And in an ideal world that’s how things would have worked. But we don’t live in an ideal world. We live in a world where that type of thinking is considered naivety. Kind people sacrifice themselves and donate their time to make this world a better place. They expect others to possess the same feelings.</p> <p>They expect that everyone would want to live in a hate-free world where the feeling of togetherness would create priceless bonds between people. However, when that bubble pops it is usually too late to turn back the clock. They can not change their approach towards people. They’re doomed to a life full of unfulfilled expectations from the wrong people. That’s when they realize this is not what they wanted and happiness has well and truly passed them by without as much as a ‘hello’.</p> <h2>8. They work too hard</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1261.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>The perfect example for someone who works too hard would be that colleague of yours you can count on whenever you have a wedding to attend or a hangover from last night. All you need to do is simply ask and they will comply. It is not in their genes to think rationally or selfishly. They will just do it if you ask nicely enough. Even if that means losing eight hours of sleep, receiving a telling-off from the parents at home or even staying on an empty stomach.</p> <p>They just don’t want any sort of trouble for their loved ones or the ones they care for. This accounts for all the promotions they didn’t get, all the bonuses they weren’t offered or even the empty garage they wanted to fill with a new car. Good people tend to make these sacrifices without considering the repercussions they would have to face. All the things that would give them and their family joy were suddenly unavailable to them just because of their loving nature.</p> <h2>7. Lack of self-satisfaction</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1262.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>These people can’t help but feel that they’re not doing enough. They think that they have a bigger purpose than just doing the ordinary every day. They want to give back to the society in ample amounts. They exhaust themselves and their resources completely in order to achieve some sort of positive end-result.</p> <p>But they never stop to think that they’ve done what they could. They’re always thinking about how they can improve as people and what more should be done for the society. These feeling of under-achievement is always gnawing at the core inside them. It never lets them truly relish the happiness they conjure up.</p> <h2>6. Overthinking</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1263.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>Kind people are generally more intelligent and intellectual than those lurking in the dark shadows of the earth. They tend to analyze everything with attention to detail. This power can be quite beneficial if it didn’t come with a price, sadness is the price they have to pay. The sadness is a result of their brainpower pulling the strings in all sorts of different directions.</p>     <p>These people cannot sit idle. They cannot hold their hands up and say we’ve done it all. There is always someone in need of help. There is always something wrong that needs to be right. There is always something that needs to be done. All of these thoughts circle around in their heads causing them to overthink. Forcing them to point where they’re on the brink of falling into depression.</p> <h2>5. Fear</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1264.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>These warm-hearted delights roam around living their lives in fear. They live in fear of hurting another’s feelings or crossing a self-constructed line that they’re not supposed to. They don’t demand or ask for anything they’re entitled to because they think it might come off as being a snob. They converse with others cautiously.</p> <p>They’re walking on egg shells most of the time, in fear of what others may perceive. As Ralph Emerson said, “Fear defeats more people than any other thing in the world”. Fear inertly rules their lives and the decisions they make. In the end, it turns out to defeat them and happiness yet again stays an illusion.</p> <h2>4. Stress</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1265.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>These unfortunately undermined people tend to stress themselves out. We know that they overthink a lot but stress is one of the most precariously toughest vices they have to encounter. No one in their right mind ‘wants’ to stress out over tiny issues, but these issues aren’t tiny for them. They consider each and every aspect of the decisions they make before making them. This causes a lot of extra baggage in the mind that tends to spill-over and causes lots of stress.</p> <p>They don’t stress over problems related to them, no. They stress over problems faced by ones that are really close to them. Your sister won’t be able to sleep knowing that you’re not home and it’s midnight. That’s the kind of stress I’m talking about here. This is a huge hinderance to their future aspirations of attaining happiness.</p> <h2>3. Fixing other people</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1266.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>Although us normally ignorant people know that we can’t fix others by way of giving out advice or talking sense into them. But these kind and more caring people tend to think otherwise. They believe that it is their obligation or responsibility to help others find the path to self-righteousness, whatever path that may be. They tend to lose sight of their own personal motives and work towards building better and stronger people.</p> <p>They invest a lot of themselves into others, hoping that it’ll all be worth it one day. But as harsh is the reality of life, they forget that this is not a world full of saints. This is a world full of leg-pullers and two-faced people trying to catch other’s off-guard. They don’t believe in the notion that others might be trying to ruin them while they spend days and nights trying to fix them.</p> <h2>2. Push over</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1267.jpeg"/>shutterstock  <p>“Oh that guy? Yeah he’s sooo nice” “yea I dont think he’ll mind us going…. Besides, he probably doesnt want to anyway”. That is exactly what a jolly person does not want to hear. It crushes his heart and soul; drowning in the darkness and the fear of negligence. People like “that guy” wear a mask all day and fetch the acceptance of their friends and teachers.</p> <p>Trying something different is the outlands for them as the only reason their present in their respective social circles is because the “dont mind” or “will always be there”. Even though there called jewels but what they don’t realize is the reality behind all that flattering. Its the fact that their called jewels but their merely pieces of coal to their so called “friends”; dark and unwanted compared to jewels. Their pushed over multiple times, whether its sports or music or any opportunity where they could express their true jewel-like selves but only to be shunned down because of the fact that “oh he won’t mind”. The art of negligence is ever present and its artists are painting the true people black; distant from the eyes of society.</p> <h2>1. Over observant</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1268.jpeg"/>shutterstock  <p>When kind people come into the equation, they add a completely different element to the situation. They are given this ability to observe everything. You can call this a gift or a curse. Kind people have different perspectives on certain situations. They are present even when you dont need them and they build this force around you that what affects you affects them. If you put it precisely, kind people do not understand the phenomenon of living.</p>     <p>They coerce themselves to squeeze themselves into situations where if they weren’t present, they’d actually find happiness; craved by this cluster of kind people. Caring and observing too much of different situations simultaneously may be jiberish to a lay man but its this creation that makes it its life’s aim to “bud in” and “fix it” which entirely leads to them completely ignoring the fluidity of life. They do not live and nor do they let live</p>   <i></i>
