         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -2<p>Media plays an important role in shaping and influencing our thought process. The power and sway of entertainment industry can easily shape the opinion of many. The tendency of Hollywood films of depicting inappropriate adult undertones in almost every genre, make one question their work ethics. Apparently that is what ‘sells’ and therefore is indispensable to be exhibited despite being deemed socially dysfunctional behavior. The nature of entertainment industry is as such that they will distract us with different contexts and busy us with thousand other things while depicting these scenes. They will make us swallow all the non-sense by sugar coating it with humor and seemingly innocent story line. The fact of the matter remains same: socially unacceptable behavior being hyped and in fact giving ideas to the audience on how women or men for that matter may be taken advantage of.</p> <p>When we say socially unacceptable we primarily mean sexual harassment. It can be defined as an overly frank behavior with another person suggestive of sexual undertones and without the consent of the person to whom such advances are being made. In our contemporary society, such acts will not be accommodated even at the tiniest scale. Yet some of the blockbuster movies of yesteryear made the scenes on the very same topic and managed to slip past that questionable content right to you. It speaks volumes about the attitude of the Hollywood film industry towards this subject and their inadvertently encouraging such behavior by glorifying it.</p> <p>It may not come as a surprise then that Hollywood is very much steeped in sexism and it is still business as usual or them. We can take into account the ground realities for making that statement. Around 10.2 billion $ industry is still figuring out how to make equality in their pay to their women actors. Most of the roles are played by men with women only playing 31% of the speaking roles in the year 2016. Women portrayed as sole protagonist only consisted of 29% of all the films produced in 2016. These figures do tell us of the women representation in films and the way they will be presented to the audience. Such an environment is not conducive to encourage and respect women the way they actually deserve it. Add to it the constant objectification of women through their roles in such films just paints a very bleak picture as far as societal norms are concerned. The fact that all of this is endorsed by Hollywood is because we the audience never feel to question these morals. Such is the subtle and sometimes not so subtle nature of the sexually inappropriate content being shown.</p> <p>The recent scandal of Harvey Weinstein may come as a rude awakening to the masses about the dark underbelly of this industry. It took almost 30 years for the industry to finally realize that one individual was in the wrong. This is indication enough that Hollywood try to brush topics like equal opportunity employment and gender discrimination under the carpet. Unless the mess is so big that it is bound to come out in the media like this scandal did. No wonder the movies coming out will reek of the same ideals and attitude.</p> <h2>7. Just go with it (2011)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1062.jpeg"/>Colombia Pictures <p>The plot of the movie revolves around a plastic surgeon (Adam Sandler) who has a lovely assistant (Jennifer Aniston) to do a favor for him and act as his ex-wife in order to draw an attention of another girl to him. The movie is all about unprovoked and unwelcomed advances made by Adam Sandler to get the attention of the girl. Apart from the fact that overly frank behavior is depicted as something normal both the women character were portrayed in a highly objectifying manner. As though they are not an individual with their own rights and opinion rather are solely as objects to gratify men.</p> <h2>6. Bad Teacher (2011)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1063.jpeg"/>Colombia Pictures <p>Cameron Diaz played a highly questionable role where she plays a high school teacher with no real teaching skills. She has feelings for another fellow teacher and decides she needs breast implants to stand a chance of securing that relationship. As though women have no moral compass when they fall for a relationship. This was another attempt to please the male fantasies which had nothing to do with the real world.</p> <h2>5. Tootsie (1982)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1064.jpeg"/>Colombia Pictures <p>The protagonist (Dustin Hoffman) is a budding actor who could not find himself a successful audition so he switches to his alter ego as “Dorothy Micheals” to land himself a role. His co-star (George Gaynes) develops an immediate affection for Dorothy not knowing he is actually a man. It could have been fine if it was limited to innocent attraction but his co-star makes unwelcome advances and in one scene comes on too strong and kisses him forcefully. In another scene he tries to take advantage of her and forcefully have sex with him but his attempts are cut short by “Dorothy’s” roommate entering the scene. All this comical drama may appear funny and may be forgotten over a few laughs because we all know the character is actually a man. However if we seriously sit back and assess the depiction and imagery being telecasted, all the humor very conveniently made invisible the unacceptable behavior that is being shown. A woman, albeit he is actually a man, may expect her colleagues to make unwelcome advances to the point where they can even get physical with her.</p>     <h2>4. Men in Black 2 (2002)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1065.jpeg"/>Colombia Pictures <p>Agent J (Will Smith) in a bid to hide his friend (Rosario Dawson) from alien invaders takes her to his bug like companions. Those creatures make all types of inappropriate comments to her which strongly suggest sexual undertones. Agent J tries to diffuse the insinuations by his companions by addressing the gravity of the situation at hand. Upon which his friend implies she has faced worse situations than this. So the bottom line is that we are made to laugh at a situation where comical looking creatures are making highly inappropriate comments to a woman who is in turn admitting to the fact that she has been disrespected even more than the present scenario.</p> <h2>3. The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1066.jpeg"/>Paramount Pictures <p>Jordan Belfort (Leonardo di Caprio) learns that he sexually assaulted two flight attendants while under the influence of drugs. The plot tries to make it relevant by showing that Jordan is someone who is capable of such acts as he lives with a devil may care attitude. The depiction of the scene with some upbeat rock music playing in the background and on the other hand serious matter of fact tone of his friend when he recalls the whole event tries to make the situation come off as funny. The contrast between the two scenes does to some extent make it appear hilarious but that does not change the fact that it was definite workplace sexual harassment. No one touches upon that sensitive subject under the thin veil of entertainment and we all laughingly overlook this otherwise socially unacceptable behavior.</p> <h2>2. Terms of Endearment (1983)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1067.jpeg"/>Paramount Pictures <p>In the initial half of the movie, Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson) is shown as a person who is very much into his neighbor Aurora (Shirley MacLeine). Always making insinuating remarks about both of them enjoying time together, hinting at his eagerness to get in her pants. His attempts to convey his ulterior motives are not that subtle, like in one scene he lightly brushes her arm with his hand. The reaction of his neighbor is typical of an uptight yet submissive woman who is devoid of standing up for herself as she simply flinches and takes a more protective stance by pulling her sweater closer. The scene is showing that women are usually not strong enough to stand their ground and complain out rightly. While men will take advantage of this silence and keep on coming as they know they will not face any resistance.</p> <h2>1. Clueless (1995)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1068.jpeg"/>Paramount Pictures <p>A young college girl (Alicia Silverstone) is walking down the campus road is constantly being eye balled and wolf whistled making her visibly uncomfortable. She is trying to adjust to the situation when out of nowhere a guy jumps up right next to her and tries to put his arms around her. She simply shoves the guy away angrily indicating she is strong and confident. Although it did portrayed her as a person who knew how to tackle these bullies, still it showed that women are nothing more than a public property for men. The way she was facing all those guys staring and gawking at her and how one even proceeded to be too frank to make physical contact.</p>     <p>These scenes from the famous movies are only a fleeting glimpse into the sexually incorrect and inaccurate ideals endorsed by the Hollywood. The fact that a scandal as old as Weinstein surfacing now shows the seriousness of Hollywood to tackle these issues. Film producers and writers may feel that these scenes may be relevant to the plot but they should give a thought or two about these impressions that will impact the society at large.</p>   <i></i>
