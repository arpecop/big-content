We only need to look at dialysis patients and the long waiting list for liver donations to fully realize this. Unfortunately, many of us don’t really think about our liver as much as we should. Being too careless could result in our liver filling up with toxins and making us sicker and sicker every day.</p> <p>In order to avoid this unpleasantness, we need to stay a bit alert. More specifically, we should be aware of the warning signs discussed below:</p> <h2>7. The Warning Pain</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1420.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>The liver is located in the upper right portion of our abdomen. If we feel pain in that region, it is usually a sign of certain liver issues. The pain is most commonly a dull one, so a sharp and searing pain may b a sign of something else.</p> <p>The liver’s function is mainly to flush out the toxins in the food we eat. When it came to our ancestors and those who eat clean today, this job is easy. However, with the greasy and fatty foods we consume today, the liver is little more than an overburdened pack animal.</p> <p>Instead of filtering out the bad stuff, the liver could actually become inundated by toxins. When this happens, it can no longer help us to digest our food properly. Instead of sorting out the nutrients in what we eat, the liver could actually swell. The resulting pain is a definite sign that we’re dealing with some sort of toxicity here.</p> <h2>6. Repairing Through Swelling</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1421.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Along with the liver, the leg and ankle may also swell when this vital organ isn’t functioning at optimal level. This usually happens when one doesn’t pay heed to what they are putting in their body.</p> <p>When we ignore the liver to a large extent, it could try to heal itself anyway. It does so by simply producing more and more scar tissue. Since it is still being pumped with unnatural toxins, the scar tissues don’t do much healing for the liver. In fact, it makes the liver become less and less functional every day.</p> <p>If there is a large amount of scar tissue, portal hypertension occurs. This is when a lot of fluid is produced and collects in the legs, especially the ankles. The swelling itself may cause no pain, but it is a warning sign. With both legs swollen, one can find it very difficult to walk. Even the thighs could become affected in this way. The lower part of the body may hence look huge as compared to the top part.</p> <h2>5. Packing on Pounds</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1422.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>If you find yourself gaining weight without explanation, you may want to get yourself tested for liver toxicity. Most of us gain weight due to excessive eating or some hormonal imbalance. If both of these factors are ruled out, the liver is most likely causing these extra pounds.</p> <p>This usually happens when we consume too many artificial sweeteners, fatty foods, alcohol, or specific medicines. Our liver thus becomes so full of toxins that it cannot possibly empty them all out using our regular bodily functions. Hence, the liver comes up with a solution which is as problematic as it is temporary.</p> <p>This bright idea is to store all those pesky and yucky toxins in the fat cells. If the liver runs out of fat cells, it simply creates more! We can see why this might be a problem, especially when we want to fit into our favorite dress. This would also explain why all those hours at the gym seem to have no effect. While exercise is good for the liver, we also need to look at other factors which could be causing liver problems.</p>     <p>Hence, we should ask about any medication we’re given with regards to its effect on the liver. We should also be careful about consuming the wrong types of food. Artificial sweeteners, for instance, may be popular for those concerned about their weight. However, many health experts now recommend shunning those evil little packets. Natural sweeteners like fruit, honey, and jaggery in controlled amounts are a much better option.</p> <h2>4. The Telling Itch</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1423.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Another sign of a problematic liver is the onset of several allergies. This could signal a liver that is overworked and tired. As a result, any new toxins entering the body are detected as allergens instead of something the liver can fight.</p> <p>Hence, the body works to attacks these allergens itself. It does so by producing antibodies, histamines, and several other chemicals. All of these serve to make one break out in rashes and even itchy hives.</p> <p>When the liver is healthy and functioning well, it would deal with an allergen without all these harmful side effects. It is hence better to make sure your liver works properly rather than be the scratchy person at a social gathering.</p> <h2>3. Going Yellow</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1424.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>When the liver is compromised, a condition called jaundice can rear its ugly head. While it is not really a disease or illness in and of itself, jaundice is a sign of certain bodily problems. The liver is making and collecting a lot of bilirubin with the body. This is essentially a yellowish pigment. When red blood cells die and are broken down, this pigment is released.</p> <p>When the liver is not working properly, it cannot do away with this color and the chemical that causes it. As a result, the affected person becomes fit to star on The Simpsons.</p> <h2>2. Too Tired to Move</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1425.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>There is a condition called the chronic fatigue syndrome. Some may call it simple tiredness, but it is actually much more than that. With this condition, you get to feel like you have the flue for around half a year at least. The reason, as you may have guessed is a liver stuffed with toxins.</p> <p>The liver is also responsible for much of the energy we use every day. This organ is what makes use of glucose and turns it into glycogen. This is not only used immediately by the body as energy, but also stored away for future use. When the liver cannot produce glucose due to becoming extremely tired itself, we may find our energy levels dangerously sagging. Needless to say, this causes a great dip in our everyday productivity and ability to lead a normal life.</p> <h2>1. What is to be Done?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1426.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>The above warnings should have scared you into being always on the lookout for liver problems. At the same time, however, there is really no need to start panicking.</p> <p>The liver is a wonderfully versatile and hardy organ, even if it doesn’t worry us sometimes.</p> <p>There is no need to despair at the first slight sign of possible liver toxicity. This organ is absolutely capable of healing itself. All we have to do is lead a healthier life and star exercising. This is something everyone should undertake regardless of their liver situation.</p> <p>If we don’t take the proper steps, we may face many more problems than the ones listed above. Anxiety, depression, migraines, perspiration, negativity and a whole lot more disturbing experiences could be in our near future.</p> <p>The key is to stop burning the liver and the body in general. This means we stop ourselves from inhaling junk food every single week. Some people resort to detoxes and body cleanses in order to reverse the havoc they’ve created within their systems. We recommend not going overboard on these. However, green tea, lemon water, turmeric water, and organic produce are essential for a healthy liver. You may soon feel much more energetic and productive than before if you follow a proper healthy lifestyle.</p>     <p>The liver removes a whole lot of toxins from our body on a regular basis. On top of this, it has hundreds of other medical functions. So start dealing with the dangerous signs today, or you could risk losing this stalwart and loyal organ!</p>   <i></i>
