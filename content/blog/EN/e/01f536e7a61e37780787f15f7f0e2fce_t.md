         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -6<p> </p> <p>Human psyche has an in-built characteristic of telling lies when they are exposed to unfavorable conditions. Girls are considered the boss at lying in such a way that no one can probably detect the truth. Girls lie whenever they see that they have no other option to save their relationship, knowing the truth, and negotiating the moments of embarrassment. At times, people face difficulties in judging whether a girl is lying or telling truth. Here are some common lies that the girls tell, and you need to be familiar with.</p> <h2>17. I am okay:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-177.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Whenever a girl says that she is okay, it is a lie. More often than not, girls have the tendency to show that they are okay but actually they are not. The females prefer hiding their emotional condition because they think that letting a guy know what they are going through might impair their image.</p> <h2>16. I do not care about your ex:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-178.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>If your girlfriend knows that you had a relationship before, she would continuously ask you about her. And at the end she will say that she does not care about your ex. But the fact is that she often thinks about what kind of relationship you had, what kind of girl your ex was, how many times you dated her, and whether you both went physical or not. Girls are possessive creatures, they cannot think of sharing you with someone else. When it comes to your ex, your girlfriend might think that you are still talking to her, and this might encourage her to stalk your ex’s profile.</p> <h2>15. I won’t get mad:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-179.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>If you are hiding something from your girlfriend and she gets a clue; she will ask you over and over again. The first and foremost thing that she would say is “You can share it with me, I won’t get mad, I will help you and understand your situation”. The thing is that this sentence quite true. She will not get mad at you, she will get furious. And who knows? Might murder you as well. This trick is merely used to extract the information that you are hiding. Once that information is extracted, this promise becomes as irrelevant as the word “t” in tsunami.</p> <h2>14. I never get jealous:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-180.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>A girl might tell her boyfriend that she is not jealous of him spending time with his female friends, and she has no issues with them having lunch or dinner. But deep inside, she is jealous. Jealousy is one of the most common traits among the human species which cannot end or be lessened. If your girl tells you that she is not jealous, never believe her. Your non-stop outings with your female friends might cause a big explosion.</p> <h2>13. It is alright if you are not willing to have a relationship:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-181.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>How often do you see a girl confessing that she likes you? The trouble begins when you reject her by saying that you are not ready for a relationship. A girl being image conscious, lessens the embarrassment of being rejected by saying that she understands that you are not ready and she is not ready either. Deep inside she feels shocked as well as embarrassed about the rejection from a guy, in which she invested her precious time.</p> <h2>12. Sure, take my number:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-182.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>Ever saw a girl getting annoyed by a guy, who is continuously trying to talk to her? And she ends up giving him her number? If you think that the annoying guy played his trick right, then you are wrong. Most probably when the guy would go back home and call her, he will receive a reply “Sorry it’s a wrong number”. So this sums up the story; if a girl gives you her phone number, never feel excited because it might be a lie.</p> <h2>11. I have never done this before:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-183.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>When it comes to getting naughty and doing something sexual, the girls always try to be as innocent as possible. Girls try to hide their previous sexual experiences from their boyfriends. It is not that all the girls are same, but when it comes to being innocent, most of the girls lie.</p> <h2>10. Do not worry. I won’t tell anyone:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-184.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>When you are going through tough times, your girlfriend will surely ask you to tell what happened. She will repeatedly ensure you that this secret will stay between both of you and no one would ever know about it. Once you tell them the whole story, and moreover the story is hilarious and juicy; they will surely share it with her mom, sister or best friend. Nothing personal, but this happens quite often.</p>     <h2>9. Wait I will be ready in 5 minutes:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-185.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>Expecting a girl to get ready as fast as a guy is like expecting an elephant to lay eggs. Whenever a girl asks you to wait for 5 minutes, she means 45 minutes. She has to do her makeup, choose and change her outfit, wear a nice pair of shoes, find a matching handbag, transfer her stuff to the handbag that she chose and finally look into the mirror for half an hour to make sure that she looks good. This lie may frustrate you, but the end result is quite prettier than what you expect. So going out with Tinkerbell to a party is worth to wait for.</p> <h2>8. Yes I would love to hang out again:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-186.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>If a boring guy dates a girls, the girl tries to avoid him as much as she can. She wait for the date to get over, continuously counting the minutes passing by. When the time is over, and the guy asks her about her experience. She tells him that she had a great time, and would want to meet again. If this happens to you, do not get excited because your excitement might not last long. The girl might unfollow, unfriend or block you from messaging her; once the date is over.</p> <h2>7. I trust you:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-187.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>It won’t take a research to prove that more than half of the girls existing on this planet have trust issues. If your girlfriend says that she loves you, there are high chances that she might be lying. How can you expect your girlfriend to trust you when you are going out with your female friends and replying her late? Even if she trusts you now, this truth will surely turn into a lie on some point.</p> <h2>6. No, I’m not hungry:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-188.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>When a guy avoids eating food in a restaurant, and asks his girlfriend to order food for herself. She replies by saying that she is not hungry, even if she is starving. The reason behind this lie is that society thinks that girls eat less food than guys. This societal pressure induces her to reject the food and wait until her boyfriend orders something for himself.</p> <h2>5. I will pay, it is not a big deal:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-189.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>There are girls who pay bills for their boyfriends and male friends. When asked, these girls reply by saying that they are okay with it and they never mind paying the bills. This might be true sometimes. But now I will ask you to imagine yourself and your girlfriend, going out on a dinner. In this sort of conditions, the girls NEVER want to pay. They want their prince to handle the bills.</p> <h2>4. This looks stupid. doesn’t it?:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-190.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>Girls find newer and more innovative ways of receiving a complement. She would usually ask you about a thing, and would ask you if that thing looks stupid. You have to answer the complete opposite, or you are dead.</p> <p>For instance, if your girl says, “I prefer going on parties wearing the pink skirt, isn’t that stupid?”. Your reply should be, “No honey, you look amazing in pink”.</p> <h2>3. Valentine’s day is not important:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-191.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>How many times does it happen when your girlfriend tells you that she does not care about the Valentine’s day because with you all the days she had were the Valentine’s days. Even if she says this thing. Deep inside she wants you to buy her a gift, plan a date and wish her in one of the most romantic ways.</p> <h2>2. Go and have a boys night:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-192.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>Girls rarely allow their boyfriends to have a night out with their friends. Societal happenings and movies made an impression in girls’ minds that boys drink, smoke and go out with other girls during their night outs. Due to these factors, even if she allows you to go; make sure that she is really agreeing and you text her on time. Or the consequences would be quite destructive.</p> <h2>1. I don’t know, do whatever you want:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-193.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com     <p>If you are arguing with your girl on a certain issue and your point of view contradicts with that of her. And you start persuading her to agree with you. Often, your girlfriend will tell you to do what you like. Do not fall for it. It is not a permission, it is a hidden warning. She is actually warning you that she no longer cares about what you do. So either you do what you like or choose her over it.</p>   <i></i>
