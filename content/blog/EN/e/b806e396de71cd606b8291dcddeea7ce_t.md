However, the problem of not weighing enough is no less serious than being overweight. In addition to this, many may want to gain weight in muscle form. For either of these problems, we have a possible solution!</p> <p>If someone’s calories intake is less than their usage, they would find it hard to gain weight. Hence, those who seek to gain weight for their health as well as to put on muscle should consider these foods:</p> <h2>19.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1076.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Protein shakes and smoothies are the way to go for increased strength and weight at the same time. However, we highly recommend avoiding the commercial kind, since they get most of their taste and calories from sugar. Stick with the natural kind, and you would get the nutrition and results you crave!</p> <p>Get into the habit of blending everything together yourself. You could add in bananas, whey protein, nut butter, chia seeds, flaxseeds, etc. Change up the flavors and ingredients as you go! This would give you a power burst in the morning and get those muscles in top working order.</p> <p>You may also include berries (freeze them for a creamy consistency!), natural yogurt, and avocados. For more iron in your belly, add some raw spinach! This is a little hack that won’t change the flavor and yet get some superb benefits inside of you.</p> <p>When did right, protein smoothies could up your calorie intake by four hundred to six hundred calories. Plus, these calories would be chockfull of nutrients, mineral, and vitamins. These are all essential in building healthier and sturdier body.</p> <h2>18.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1077.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Milk is a natural way to gain weight and build muscle. It isn’t just for calcium, but also for getting in your daily protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Of course, this particular foodstuff is not for those who are allergic to dairy.</p> <p>For those who are good with milk, it can be a valuable source of essential nutrients. It’s essentially a combination of casein and whey, which can increase your weight more than any other protein. Get your milk intake through downing it as a snack when your tummy’s rumbling. You could also have it with any meal or after your daily workout.</p> <h2>17.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1078.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Consuming rice is a convenient, inexpensive, and healthy choice for gaining weight in a safe manner. When you cook rice, you can get almost 200 calories and 43 grams of carbs in a cup. At the same time, you get just around 6 grams of fat. Hence, rice is excellent for those who want to put on more muscle than fat.</p> <p>If someone is struck with a waning appetite, rice is a great way to get in as many calories as possible. Some kinds of rice may even be cooked in the microwave. If you have the time, space, and money, a rice cooker could be a great investment. Plus, it’s generally a staple across several cultures. You can top it off with any curry, dry sidelines, or even some sauces.</p> <p>However, too much rice is not highly recommended by several health experts. This is because it could have some acidic and even arsenic elements within it. You don’t want too many toxins in your body. Hence, avoid eating rice for every meal every day. This could prevent your body from absorbing the necessary iron and zinc for proper weight and muscle gain. Eat locally sourced rice in order to avoid these negative aspects.</p> <h2>16.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1079.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Take a handful of nuts a couple of times a day when you’re in the mood for a snack. Remember, however, that peanuts are legumes and not exactly nuts. Hence, get your nut intake through almonds, cashews, pecans, pistachios, and walnuts. These are delicious, healthy filling, and an excellent way to gain a decent amount of weight. Just a handful could include as much as seven grams of protein and eighteen of fat. Don’t worry about the high-fat content though; it’s the healthy kind. The high amount of calories would also help you in achieving your goal.</p> <h2>15.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1080.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>If you can’t find the time to get in your nuts by crunching them, try grinding them. When you grind almonds enough, they turn into delicious and nutritious almond butter. You can also buy any organic nut butter to add that delicious protein kick to your breakfast smoothie. However, if you are purchasing these butters, make sure they have no added oils or sugar. It is, of course, best if you make the butter yourself by just grinding the nuts to a creamy state.</p> <p>So get in your calories by spreading these butters on your toast or using them as a snack. There’s also no harm in making healthy peanut butter at home and having it with a sliced apple! Put them in oatmeal and yogurt for more yummy treats.</p> <h2>14.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1081.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Red meat is a must if you want to build healthy muscle. A simple steak could give you about three grams of leucine in one ounce of meat. This is the amino acid you require in order to get your muscle system working at optimal level. Increasing your intake of red meat would thus also lead to increased muscle tissue.</p> <p>What’s more, red meat also contains a high amount of creatine. All this means is that it helps greatly in building muscle more than just about any other food.</p> <p>As an added bonus, red meat contains a lot more calories and fat than the leaner, white kind. This would help you to increase your calorie intake and make it more difficult to burn off with all your activities. The proof of this red meat advantage is apparent through clinical trials and studies. Even the elderly could stand to gain a lot of weight and muscle by increasing their intake of red meat.</p> <h2>13.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1082.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Strachey foods such as rice and potatoes are effective ways to bulk up your body. What’s more, they are on their cheaper side of your diet, so there’s no breaking the bank here. They would give you the high amount of calories you need if you use them right.</p> <p>For instance, increasing your intake of potatoes doesn’t mean binging on French fries all the time. This may increase your weight, but in a way that would make you lethargic and tired all the time. Hence, just cook your potatoes in with a curry or mash them up and mix in some beans or veggies.</p> <p>Other starchy foods that are excellent for weight gain are corn, buckwheat, quinoa, oatmeal, squash, beans, and legumes. This would not just increase your calorie intake but also your glycogen. The latter is what you need in order to propel your sports and active lifestyle. As an added bonus, you also get in some sources of fiber and protein. The resistant starch can also help your good stomach bacteria to flourish and prevent many diseases.</p> <h2>12.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1083.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Oily fish may put some people off, but it has many of the same benefits as red meat. Salmon and sardines, for instance, are excellent ways to get in your daily protein and a healthy fat intake. It also gives you omega-3 fatty acids, which are very beneficial for your body. We can’t produce these acids on our own, so we have to make do with outside sources.</p> <p>You can easily down six ounces of fish, which would give you around four grams of healthy fats. It would also add more than three hundred calories to your daily count. The protein in this serving size is a whopping thirty-four grams! All these benefits come together to help you I healthy weight and muscle gain.</p>     <h2>11.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1084.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>If you simply don’t have the time or money to get in enough protein through food, there’s no harm in relying on supplements. Protein supplements have actually helped out many athletes and bodybuilders who couldn’t get in a proper amount. This could also help you to regulate your protein intake. Too much protein, like everything else, could be harmful.</p> <p>Strength training is usually couple with supplements like whey protein and even certain mass gainers. These options don’t usually cost a lot, and are healthier than you may think. Whey protein is essentially a dairy product and can actually improve your health. It also helps in fighting off various diseases that could prevent weight gain. Hence, you can always use the supplements before or after your workout and see the result in a few weeks’ time.</p> <h2>10.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1085.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Along with nuts, dry fruit is a great way to get in your calories, nutrients, and antioxidants all at once. Try mixing raisins with your daily intake of nuts, along with dried figs and berries. This makes for a delicious combination that could have you snacking all day long.</p> <p>However, dried fruit also tends to be very high in sugar. This could make you gain weight rapidly, but would probably not be a good option for the long term. As for candied fruit, it is best if you avoid that altogether.</p> <p>In short, dried fruit is a convenient and tasty option. There’s no need to fear that it is any less in nutritional value since most of it stays put even after the drying process. You can also mix them in with your oatmeal, yogurt, and even meat for a different and wonderful combination. There’s also a great deal of fiber in there, so don’t be afraid to have some dried fruit for dessert!</p> <h2>9.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1086.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>We may shun bread, thinking they are unhealthy and evil. However, whole-grain bread could be your new best friend! This contains a whole lot of carbs and helps in making up several easy and delicious meals. Slap on meat, cheese, and eggs onto those healthy slices and enjoy!</p> <p>However, make sure that your bread doesn’t have preservatives or sugar added in them. Like always, it’s best and very easy to make your own whole-wheat or wholegrain bread at home. However, there are several market options that would do just as well. Try to go for the seed and whole-grain variety whenever you can.</p> <h2>8.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1087.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Avocados see to be everywhere this year. They are chock-full of healthy calories and a great source of fat. You can blend it into a guacamole, or even use it as an ingredient for hummus. You can use one large avocado to get in more than three hundred calories as well as several grams of fat and fiber. Add this to the minerals, vitamins, and other benefits of this amazing fruit and you’ve got a winning combo.</p> <p>Switch up your eggs and sandwiches by adding in a few slices of avocado. You can also simply eat them with a little seasoning for a yummy and filling snack.</p> <h2>7.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1088.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Don’t go for the boxed sugary stuff in supermarkets. Instead, get in your cereal dose though grain-based cereals. These could be oats, bran, granola, Ezekiel, and much more. Consuming the proper kind of cereals would not only give you healthy calories, but also fiber and vitamins.</p> <h2>6.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1089.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>If you look carefully, you can find some packaged cereal bars that are healthy and convenient in one go! If you’re constantly on a tight schedule, you can utilize these awesome little punches of health very well. Use them around your training sessions in order to get your muscle-building system going.</p> <p>You can also use healthy grains and other ingredients to make your own bars. Invest in an hour or so every Sunday and make enough to last you the whole week. The great part is that many of these bars can be frozen and taken out as needed. Add in dried fruit seeds, nuts, coconut, and even some dark chocolate flakes.</p> <h2>5.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1090.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Milk chocolate may be delicious, but it’s not the real deal. Neither is Nutella, we’re afraid. Invest in some good quality dark chocolate for the real chocolate experience. This would increase your weight without the adverse health effects. A 70% cocoa content or higher is the usual recommendation.</p> <h2>4.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1091.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Greasy cheese on pizza is obviously not the way to go when you’re in a training program. However, it is a great protein source if you eat it enough. It’s loaded with calories, fats, and tastes like heaven! You can use it as a way to snazzy up your meals and make them more delicious and nutritious. Not to mention adding a few hundred calories as you go!</p> <h2>3.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1092.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>When trying to build muscle, many athletes and bodybuilder would eat around half a dozen eggs every day. This may seem like a lot, but eggs are actually among the healthiest food we can find. It has long been shunned for its supposed effect on the heart and cholesterol levels. However health experts now highly recommend as part of a healthy diet whether you want to gain or lose weight.</p> <p>Whatever you do, don’t throw away that precious yolk! That’s where most of the benefits are, in addition to the calories. You would need all of those if you want your strength training to pay off. Of course, if you have an allergy or intolerance towards eggs, there are several substitutes that work just as well.</p> <h2>2.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1093.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Don’t be afraid to consume good, healthy, full-fat yogurt. In some ways, yogurt is even healthier than milk, especially when it comes to strength training. The wonderful bacteria in yogurt make it taste great and give you a power pack of nutrients!</p> <p>What’s more, regular consumption of yogurt means a great combination of fats, proteins, and carbs. If you can’t eat plain yogurt, mix in a bit of honey or use it in your smoothie recipes. It also goes great with any kind of cereal! One can also mix in cocoa powder, berries, or any kind of fruit for a yummy dessert or snack. If you like, yogurt and its mix-ins could also be an excellent meal by themselves.</p> <h2>1.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1094.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>If you add in some oil or fat to your sauces or salad dressings, you can increase your caloric count. In fact, just a spoonful of oil or natural butter can give you more than a hundred calories. This is an easy and delicious way of upping your calorie intake. However, make sure that you aren’t cooking like this for people who may be concerned about losing weight.</p> <p>You should also make sure to avoid hydrogenated and processed oil. This includes most vegetable oils. Stick to extra virgin olive oil, natural coconut and avocado oil, and organic unsalted butter.</p>     <p>When seeking to gain weight, you should take care how you go about it. It is all too easy to binge on fried foods, junk, and sweets. This ma put on the fat, but it would leave you with several health problems. It is much better to eat the foods above and gain weight in a natural and healthy manner.</p>   <i></i>
