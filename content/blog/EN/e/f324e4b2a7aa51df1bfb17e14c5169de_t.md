You can inculcate habits that transform you as a person or you can build habits that destroy you. Same is true for relationships. You need to work on your relationship day in and day out. It requires effort and habits that encourage both the partners to come close in a marriage. Everybody wants a perfect relationship but without the effort. Building habits makes sure you can focus on your relationship even if you’re extremely busy and cannot think of activities to rekindle your love. Here are a few habits you can build to ensure that love amongst you never dies.</p> <h2>9. Date nights</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-742.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>This is one the most important rules that will greatly benefit you and your spouse. Date nights don’t have to be in expensive restaurants every time. It’s setting aside a specific amount of time to focus on your spouse. Talk about what has happened during the weekend, if anything is troubling either of you and unwind. There is no ideal date night.</p> <p>Try doing something different every time. Research shows that the adrenaline rushes you experience after an adventurous activity is likely to help you come together and strengthen your bond. So, if you don’t have one, its time you start a similar ritual. If you already have a date night ritual, it’s time you spice it up.</p> <h2>8. A fight resolution mechanism</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-743.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>Fights are inevitable. You are going to fight and have many arguments. What’s important is that you do not let them hold your relationship down. Develop a strategy, a rule or a process that helps you resolve an argument.</p> <p>Conflicts are of two types: Constructive and destructive. With constructive conflict, your strategy would be different compared to when you’re in a destructive conflict.</p> <p>Such a mechanism also enables that you won’t hurt the person in the heat of the moment or refuse to apologize later due to egos. So, if you don’t have one, sit down today to develop one.</p> <h2>7. Never stop flirting</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-744.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The beginning of the relationship is very different from the stage when you get comfortable with the other person.
