Strong enough to make you feel the luckiest person alive, strong enough to put you through your decline phase – same goes for your subconscious. The difference however is that in love your mind and heart is in a constant fight, trying to find the unanswered questions while your subconscious mind just knows what’s really going on. It’s always on us whether to accept it or ignore it.</p> <p>“The only path by which another person can upset you is through your own thought.”</p> <p>– Joseph Murphy</p> <p>Already getting the red signs? Read through these lines to judge if your subconscious alerts are right or wrong.</p> <h2>11. You tell yourself your partner loves you:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-20-12-3522-1-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Let’s put you through two situations to help you decide. You are sitting in a park and you look at your significant other, do you spontaneously think about all the times your partner has actually done things that keep you satisfied and happy, with the help of which your mind and heart give you one answer- your partner loves you? Or you convince your heart that through all his/her lies and all the times he/she has put you down, your partner still loves you or trying his/her best?</p> <p>Think of it as a test; ask yourself, you will eventually know your answer.</p> <h2>10. You function out of Fear, Not love or respect:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-20-12-3522-2-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>A very wise man once said that relationships cannot continue based on sheer fear. If you live your life everyday to the fear that what you do will disappoint your partner or end your relationship, you need to let it go right now.</p> <p>A relationship should not define your whole life or everything that you love to do. However, if you wake up every morning with the urge to do things you love because your partner encourages you and supports you, do yourself a favor, never leave him/her.</p> <h2>9. Are you feeling insecure?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-20-12-3522-3-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Do you always feel the need to keep a check on where your partner is going or why your partner is taking hours to reply to the morning text you sent 4 hours ago? Do you feel like you don’t have the trust factor in your relationship anymore? Do you feel insecure your partner might start loving someone better than you? Then you need to take some serious measures.</p> <p>A relationship without trust is nothing but a path with a dead end. It’s however very evident that love might be easy to find, but a person who trusts you at all times is very hard to find and so, it has more value in a relationship.</p> <h2>8. You judge yourself by his/her words:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-20-12-3522-4-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>It’s quite a fact that your life is gifted to you and not anyone on this planet and so, you have full rights to live it. If you constantly seek for your partner’s validation and approval, you might have to start looking for better options. In a relationship, a person should groom into a confident being that is focused about life and future plans.</p> <p>You don’t necessarily have to look for answers in your partner’s eyes or behavior. You are a free being, and if you judge your worth or yourself only by his/her words or what satisfies him/her, you need to start over.</p> <h2>7. You are tensed when your partner is around:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-20-12-3522-5-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>After all the stress-filled tasks of the day, you deserve to be with someone who makes you feel relaxed, not more stressed. When you are with the person you love, it gives you immense peace and a feeling of satisfaction. But, if you feel tensed and nervous around your partner and if it only makes you feel uncomfortable, then this is definitely not what you are looking for, for a lifetime.</p> <p>Relationships which are based on two people bonded emotionally are the best kind of relationships. However, if you don’t feel easy around the person you love, how will you ever get attached with him/her emotionally?</p> <h2>6. You take every conversation and every act very seriously:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-20-12-3522-6-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Your partner is still a mysterious person for you after months or even years of your relationship – does that make sense? No matter how hard you try or what you do, you cannot seem to understand the true meaning or intention behind your partner’s actions or words. You just can’t seem to understand him/her and over-analyze every word that utter from their mouths and every action that they do.</p>     <p>Now imagine if this goes on for a lifetime, are you ready for it? Your subconscious mind will give you an idea if it’s getting seriously toxic; it will give you the red alerts and inform you that something is not right. It’s you who has to trust it and take a step for the best.</p> <h2>5. You are forced to keep a check:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-20-12-3522-7-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Keeping a track of your partner’s whereabouts is a healthy act in a relationship. It gives you a feeling of responsibility and a sense of being vigilant if your partner is okay and cared for. But if this tracking takes a turn for the worst, you might have to give it a second thought.</p> <p>If on a daily bases, you track your partner’s actions and whereabouts every single second, it is a sign of a toxic relationship and so your subconscious mind alerts you by showing you the red flags. It is quite understandable that you don’t trust your partner enough or feel insecure in a relationship, as mentioned above.</p> <h2>4. Your life revolves around your partner:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-20-12-3522-8-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Your life is your possession and so, it should be fully lived by you and not someone else. If your partner has become everything in your life and if you make plans or do your tasks when he/she likes, then it will not be wrong to say that your life revolves around your partner, and trust us when we tell you it’s not a healthy thing to do. A presence of a romantic relationship does not necessarily mean you should define it by the word “life”, one should treat it only like a relationship which exists and carry out the normal tasks of life.</p> <h2>3. You have put a full stop to living:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-20-12-3522-9-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>In the reference to the above mentioned point, you have stopped living. By living we mean, you have stopped doing the things that make you feel happy and gives you a sense of independence. When you do the things you like, you define your uniqueness – That’s one thing every person has of its own.</p> <p>If you feel you cannot live your life as you wish then your partner has no importance for your happiness in his/her life and that is not what you deserve. On the other hand, if your partner is completely opposite and loves to do the things you love with you, know that your partner is the one.</p> <h2>2. Are you always the one who compromises?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-20-12-3522-10-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Do you always find yourself compromising for the things which create problems in your relationship? If so, please realize your mistake. A relationship will be faulty, messy and not easy when you least expect it to be. It’s natural, and every couple has to go through this no matter what.</p> <p>The only way to get rid of it is compromising on things which your partner hates and understanding each other but if the compromise is coming from one side of the party, that’s what needs to be changed first. A couple is defined as a team in a relationship and it’s necessary for both the team members to compromise when the team is failing.</p> <h2>1. You are always discouraged on your abilities:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-20-12-3522-11-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>A relationship becomes ultra beautiful when you have an idea how much your partner trusts you and encourages you on your abilities. Similarly, there is nothing more heart breaking than the fact that your partner has no idea about how talented you are or simply choose to discourage you on your potentials. One very bad aspect of it is, it brings down a person’s self-esteem.</p> <p>Damage to your self esteem is extremely dangerous but most of us, unfortunately, realize it when it is too late. It can become permanent in a matter of seconds and might take years for a person to gain it back. It is clear in every relationship that a partner should be the one who helps shape you into a better person with loads of credibility than the one who discourages improvements and lowers your self-confidence. Know your worth.</p>     <p>All these red alerts are the signs that you are giving too much or trying too hard in a relationship, with no expectation of a good outcome or a secured future. If your subconscious mind is alarming you of all the negative traits that affect you or may affect your future badly, it’s time you take it seriously and take some action against it. A relationship is very complicated, and every action and word counts. Make it worthwhile.</p>   <i></i>
