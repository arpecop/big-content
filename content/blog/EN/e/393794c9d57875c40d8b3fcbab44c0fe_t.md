He wouldn’t care where his money was going, and almost every time he was the first one to offer to buy you anything or even when it came to buying something for himself he would just buy it, whether he needs it or not. However, now he is trying to change this habit of his and trying not to waste all that cash on those expensive items that are good for nothing. Well certainly there could be a lot of reasons behind the change of practice, one of which could be this that he is just making sure for saving up for the wedding that he is planning.

Either it’s about going to an adventure trip or talking about buying a house, what you will notice is that he will be using ‘we’ rather then ‘me’. Back in his head, every main thing is done having you by his side, and quite naturally he just never forgets including you in anything as you are always on his mind.

Friends have a significant influence on your life, even if you have been planning different things in life, the stories of your friends will have the power for changing your mind and flowing their lead.

However, if your guy takes interest in what you are shopping and he helps you with it then it really means something else. And you really are special to him. He will help you pick stuff up and even while shopping he will suggest you what to buy and what will suit you the best.

It is very much needed for him to acknowledge your aspirations and dreams and not just that he has to believe in them as much as you do, simply because there is no logic in planning a life with somebody whose goals are not known to you, who has not enough value to make you a part of their plans and their goals. If he is a believer of your goals and your dreams and agrees to be holding your hand while you excel ahead in achieving them, he is definitely considering to make you his future wife.</p> <h2>10.

The face that you have met his family is evident enough for giving you a hint that this is not something temporary. And furthermore, if his family adores you then it’s even much better and there are greater chances for you to have a future with him. His mom and dad love you already that they will end up suggesting that both of you should get married. And one of the reason of his parents liking you is that he has created a positive image of you in front of them and he really wishes them to like you.</p> <h2>12. No Money Problems</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2239-new-fol-11.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>There will definitely be money issues in regard to not having enough, but there will never be and money related conflicts, simply your money is his money and his money is yours.

And it works like this between him and you, it signifies that your relationship has enough understanding that even money, which is considered to be the greatest devil, doesn’t weakens it.</p> <p>However, money needs to be spent sensibly and with caution should be from both ends, him helping you financially means that he considers you as somebody who is worth spending his money on which displays his matchless attachment.</p> <h2>13.

He wants to know what your dream destination for starting a family is and whether you like cats better or dogs as pets. And the discussion about future will be exchanged normally. He will never be hesitating in asking you all kind of questions. A man only starts talking about future when it’s genuinely on his mind for quite a while.</p> <h2>14. You Have Common Interests</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2239-new-fol-13.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Well it’s quite true that opposites attract each other, however, having common interests makes it even better. Just imagine being in love with someone who enjoys reading as much as you do. You could actually take all of his books without needing to spend a single penny, now how cool is that? Sharing your interests actually strengthens the bonding between both of you so if there is a shared interest and he loves working on it with you, it’s a huge wifey sign…</p> <h2>15.
