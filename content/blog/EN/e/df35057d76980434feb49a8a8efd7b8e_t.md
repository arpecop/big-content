Just give them a good meal, and they’re happy as a clam. However, those who love to have culinary adventures sometimes make weird decisions. In fact, some may get a taste of danger by downing animals that could kill them with one slip-up.</p> <p>This may seem weird to those of us who play it safe with a burger and fries. But it would be a boring world if we were all the same. Read on below for some animals that could become a problem when eaten:</p> <h2>8. The Dangerous Puffer</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-232.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>The puffer fish is a delicacy in several places but maybe a fatal dish to consume. They are usually found in tropical waters and in African rivers. Nature has tried to warn us about the dangers of its flesh by the tiny spines along its body. Moreover, it puffs up like a balloon when they feel they are in danger.</p> <p>These natural warnings are not without reason, as some parts of the puffer fish are poisonous enough to kill a human. Just a single ounce is enough to finish you if it comes from the wrong body part.</p> <p>Not only this, but the death would in itself be a painful and torturous one. The toxin in puffer fish could numb the tongue and lips. This causes suffocation, and the body soon starts getting paralysis. There is no cure or antidote for this poison, and death can occur as quickly as within four hours. The end may also take as long as a whole day.</p> <p>Many Japanese chefs are actually trained to carve and prepare raw puffer fish. It’s still a risk, but a lot of brave people still enjoy the dish, which goes by the name of fugu.</p> <h2>7. The Barracuda Chomper</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-233.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Tropical seas hold yet another dangerous animal which may be eaten as a last meal. The Barracuda is a very violent fish, which alone should be a signal for us to leave it alone. It is like a serpent with extremely sharp teeth and it chomps everything that comes in its way. Of course, human nature would then be dying to chomp on it, too.</p> <p>This crazy fish can even give the shark a run for its money when it comes to attitude. It feeds on other fish, which in turn may feed on dinoflagellates. This is a kind of plankton that could cause ciguatera. This would, in turn, affect the barracuda.</p> <p>When the Barracuda gets affected in this way, its body swells up with all kinds of toxins. These are deadly and dangerous if consumed by humans. No amount of cooking could get rid of this toxin. Like the puffer fish poison, barracuda toxins also have no cure at the moment.</p> <h2>6. European Quail on a Picnic</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-234.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>The quail might be a very common delicacy, especially in England, but it is not always a safe one. Sure, it’s a delicious alternative to boring old chicken, but the quail also eats everything around it. Since its nests are usually on the ground, this includes seeds, insects, and any kind of fallen fruit.</p> <p>No less than three men have recently died in Turkey after consuming roasted quail. They suffered paralysis before their death as well as suffocation. The cause? Most likely the hemlock that the quail consumed during its lifetime. Quails love the seeds of this poisonous plant, which was Socrates way to go. Like the tocsins described above, cooking cannot take care of this kind of poison.</p> <h2>5. Murderous Toads</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-235.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Toads are common, but that doesn’t mean we should eat them. Many people, however, do not understand this simple logic. If they are silly enough to consume these creatures, they would likely not have much life left. The days leading up to their death would involve copious vomiting plus struggles with breathing and walk.</p>     <p>The mouth of the toad has some extremely vile and toxic secretions. Toxic to humans, not the toad, obviously. These secretions may also be on their back. So in the future, stay content with the frog legs and forget about the toads! The French know what they’re doing when it comes to food.</p> <h2>4. Triggerfish Getting Mad</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-236.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Triggerfish are not far behind the Barracuda when it comes to a bad temper and aggressive behaviour. They are especially threatening when humans venture near their nests, and they have a perfect right to.</p> <p>It mainly feeds on ocean dwellers that are spiky in appearance, like the sea urchin. These could cause the triggerfish to ingest some palytoxin. When consumed by a human, the palytoxin would constrict their blood vessels and change their chemical makeup. One gets sick and dizzy and starts losing breath. Death may not be too far off, so get help as quickly as you can!</p> <h2>3. The Big Chicken</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-237.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Ah, the ubiquitous chicken. It’s a prime favorite in every meat eater’s house, especially when they’re on a budget. Cheap, filling, and delicious, the chicken is almost inseparable from modern life. This is especially true if one is a fan of fast food.</p> <p>However, chickens are suspiciously big these days. We are now raising these birds to be four times as large as their natural size. They are injected with hormones, steroids and heaven knows what else to get to this size. This may be good for those rearing and selling them, but really bad for those eating them.</p> <p>Several studies have now linked eating chicken with the development of ovarian cysts and PCOS in females. The wings and neck, through which the steroids are injected, are especially susceptible to their negative effects. They are so concentrated here that not even cooking could do away with them.</p> <h2>2. San-nakji’s Revenge</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-238.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Koreans do have a strange sort of cuisine as compared to the rest of the world. It’s not just the animals they consumer, but also the way they cook it. San-nakji is one of these dishes, which is basically comprised of an octopus called nakji.</p> <p>After they catch the octopus, the Koreans slice it up before killing it. This would obviously cause it a lot of pain. In fact, it is considered a mastery of preparation if the pieces are moving even after being seasoned and served. However, the octopus soon takes its revenge, and we can’t blame them for this.</p> <p>While there is no toxin or poison in the octopus’ flesh, its suckers are plentiful in number. They are also very strong. As one can predict, these latch on to the eaters and choke them. We may value human life, but there is such a thing as bringing tragedy upon oneself.</p> <h2>1. Crazy Cones</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-239.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>The shellfish known as the cone shell is probably the most dangerous of its kind in the world. They come in several shapes and sizes, with the smallest ones being the least dangerous. These may not cause more harm or pain than the sting of a bee.</p> <p>There are larger kinds of shellfish that live in the Indian Ocean. It has a tongue that acts like a harpoon and has a poisonous gland to boot. The toxins it injects into its prey can cause almost-instant death for small animals. However, it also has a sort of venom that could kill more than a dozen humans with a single drop.</p> <p>Even in this case, these cone shells are served as a creamy soup in the Philippines. If prepared in the correct way, there isn’t much problem. However, it does require a careful removal of any venomous ducts. A little bit of carelessness, and one could end up losing their life for the sake of a good meal.</p>     <p>Poisonous animals are not always detected by us first world dwellers. However, reading information like this could certainly make us more aware of the risks involved in a good meal!</p>   <i></i>
