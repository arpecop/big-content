         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 1<p>One of the most entertaining families around – the Kardashians! We all know how much we love tuning in to the show when it is on television. ‘Keeping up with the Kardashians’ is religiously followed by millions and it keeps us thoroughly entertained. You have to admit that it leaves you in fits most of the time. Followed by emotional and serious moments that make us realize a lot of things about ourselves and what is happening in the world. But people mostly watch this show because it is a ‘no-brainer’ and provides us entertainment.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-1-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>They are rich, diverse, well-travelled, and famous and never seize to amaze us. They have seen things that we will only get to see on television or through them, never in real life. But there are times that we are amazed by their sensibility and the things that they have to say. So we made a list of the things that the Kardashians have to teach us.</p> <h2>17. Khloe’s shuts people down to body shamming</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-2-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>Khloe is a perfect example and motivation for reaching our body goals. She has shown the dedication and will to eat healthy and bring her chunky body into shape. She has shown what can happen if you discipline yourself and work hard.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-3-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>But at the end of the say she tells us that it is about self-esteem and very blatantly tells the world that they have no right to talk about her body. Or even judge her on shallow standards of being the ‘fat’ sister. Body shaming is a real thing and one should not let losers bring them down for being any shape or size.</p> <h2>16. Kim Lets Us Know that break-up is not easy</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-4-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>Kim sets an example that we are all humans and we go through an array of emotions. If you have broken up with a loved one, it takes time to heal and recover. The people who have to tell you ‘Just get over it, what’s the big deal?’ – need to be slapped down. Because it is never as simple as ‘get over it’ and we all know that.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-5-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>If you have shared love and affection with a person for so long, it will take time to recover from that loss and experience also. Just because some relationships do not work out that does not mean that they didn’t mean anything at all. And when we are over with these relationships, we learn to grow into better people.</p> <h2>15. Kourtney Is All About YOLO</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-6-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>It is true that you only live once, so why not make it your motto. Kourtney tells us time and time again that it is all about the experiences you have with people and the moments you live. One should cherish them and make them special.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-7-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>One should make the most of what they have and not let life bring them down. Looking at life with a positive perspective can change a lot of things in life – it is all about how you look at it. Try new things every day and be open towards things that you do not see coming. One should focus on loving the people around them and loving yourself also. Spreading positivity is the thing!</p> <h2>14. Scott teaches us to be comfortable in our skin</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-8-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>There will be haters all around you, there will always be someone who will tell you that you are not good enough. People tend to bring people down to make themselves feel better somehow. So Scott teaches us that we should be comfortable in our skin.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-9-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>We should love ourselves the way we are and not let negative people lessen our beauty and kindness. We all have positive qualities and we should embrace and grow them. Be confident about ourselves and pay no heed to the ones who just want to bring us down.</p> <h2>13. Kendall Shows That it requires hard work to shine</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-10-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>Kendall being a super model teaches us a lot of lessons. She might look glamourous and perfect from the outside but she tells us that reality is always different. We are humans at the end of the day, and what we look from the outside might not be from the inside.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-11-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>What is inside is what really matters, and confidence is not something that comes easy. There are times when a person doubts him or herself. Living a life like this is not easy and there are times that a person gets conscious about themselves. Looking this fabulous all the time takes a lot of effort and energy.</p> <h2>12. Khloe Teaches Us that we can be single and happy</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-12-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>We have seen how the Khloe’s marriage turned out to be. But Khloe showed us that even in times like these, it is important to go through things gracefully. We lose our soulmates at times and it can be very hard on a person.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-13-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>Loss is not easy to deal with and once you get into a marriage, you plan to be in it for life- but sometimes life deals us a bad card. One cannot be perfect, as humans we are flawed and sometimes we can’t keep everything together. But in those low times, we need to keep our head high and know that we will get out of it too.</p> <h2>11. Kourtney Advises We don’t use the scale as a measure of inner happiness</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-14-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>People look at how much they weight every day and decides to spend the rest of that in that particular mood. It is not about how much you weigh on a scale that should not bring you down and put you in a bad mood.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-15-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>It is all about how you feel from the inside and how fresh your body feels. Not let a machines dictate us numbers. If we keep our lifestyle healthy and eat well, everything is fine. It is not even about going all green, but just about maintaining a balance.</p> <h2>10. Kendall tells us to take a break when needed</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-16-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>Life doesn’t stop for anyone, and at times that can overwhelm us. There are times when you just want to halt and take a deep breath. Everyone deserves to take a break every now and then.</p>     <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-17-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>If you are putting the hard work in and doing a good job – nothing will stop you from reaching your goals. Just don’t be lazy – because that is the other end of the spectrum.</p> <h2>9. Kim Says every moment is special</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-18-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>Kim teaches us that every moment in our life is special, even eating food – so we should document it. One should not take life for granted and we should cherish even the smallest moment and make a memory of it.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-19-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>Appreciating life can be hard sometimes because we are so busy working and living life one step at a time that we forget to breathe and just savor the moment. Slow down and perceive things the way they are meant to be.</p> <h2>8. Kanye Embraces the rule – Family first</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-20-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>There is no doubt that family comes first. A person should know how important family is and how it should be on top of the priority list. Kanye is a business man and he is filled with ambition and passion – yet you will hardly see him here and there.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-21-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>He is mostly spending time with his family. He might be found doing stupid things, but no one can deny that he is hard working. He loves his wife deeply and lets the world see that.</p> <h2>7. Kourtney Knows how to call a spade a spade</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-22-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>We have all had our experiences with people who have lied to us, cheated and deceived us. We all know how much that hurts and we certainly do not want to be like them.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-23-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>So now that you have learnt your lesson, why would you want to waste your time with people who don’t call a spade a spade! Speaking the truth is the most important thing.</p> <h2>6. Khloe Reminds Us that we won’t stay young forever</h2> <p>Giphy</p> <p>We are not going to be young forever, we will not have the same energy as always – so let’s not take this time for granted. After you hit thirty, everything starts to go downhill and it takes twice the amount of work to stay healthy and fit.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-25-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>There is no need to rush things because we all know where life is going to take us, we were not born with eternal youth or beauty. Time passes with a blink of an eye and when you grow up – you make your boundaries very clear.</p> <h2>5. Kylie Knows being unique is important</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-26-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>Don’t follow someone just to be like them because in that process you lose who you are. Explore yourself and what you really are instead of trying to be like someone else. It is true that you can have people who you look up to or think that they are cool, you can even learn a few things from them but that certainly does not mean that you start pretending to be like them.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-27-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>Because when you pretend to be something you are not, your true inner self will get lost. Embrace yourself and be comfortable in your skin.</p> <h2>4. Kim advises everyone to ignore the haters</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-28-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>Life is too short to listen to people who just want to bring you down. Don’t waste your time responding to people who have shit things to say because you will spend more energy in a direction that doesn’t even need attention. Ignoring it is the best way possible.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-29-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>Stay strong and don’t let people judge you for just being you.</p> <h2>3. Khloe tells us to stay ‘real’</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-30-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>Don’t be a d**&amp; and just put things the way they are. There is no point pretending to be something that you are not. Khloe teaches us exactly that, one should keep things real.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-31-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>That does not mean that you start being rude to people, being courteous should be top priority.</p> <h2>2. Kim Says Everyone Should be nice and relax</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-32-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>Kim teaches us that one should be outspoken but that does not give anyone the right to be rude. One should be mature and deal with things in a respectful manner.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-33-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>No one likes unnecessary drama and wasting time on things that don’t deserve much time.</p> <h2>1. There are times that one should leave it to a higher power</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-34-gif.gif"/>Giphy <p>There are times that one should let go and leave things to a higher power. Not everything deserves the amount of attention that we give to it. Even the Kardashian family prays and believes in God.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2228-35-gif.gif"/>Giphy     <p>We as humans can’t control everything so there are times that we should let it go.</p>   <i></i>
