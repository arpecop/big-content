         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -13<p>Humans are an amazing creation with complex brains which has the capacity to do everything, from inventions to artistic illustrations and humongous structures, too. There’s this one thing which makes our brain question its abilities: Riddles! But don’t worry, these riddles are also created by humans just like you and the key to solve these ugly looking “math problems” is to focus on every detail and be simple in the explanation of these riddles.</p> <p>As we know that most riddles claim only 5% people can solve them out of all the people, we need you to go through the hardest riddles below and see if you are one of those 5% people to outstand in the circle of geniuses.</p> <h2>This One Can Mess Up With Your Common Sense!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-215.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>A 10-Foot rope hangs over the edge of a boat. The bottom rung is touching surface of the water, the rungs of the ladder are all on foot apart and the tide goes up at a rate of 6-inch per hour.</p> <p><strong>How long will it be until 3 rungs are covered in water?</strong></p> <p><strong>Answer: </strong>3 rungs will never be covered in water.</p> <p>Wondering why? Well its common sense. While the tides go up in the sea, the boat will rise up with it, making the rungs higher from the tides.</p> <h2>Duck Business</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-216.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>A child was playing in the park one morning and ran towards the pond, there he saw two ducks behind a duck, two ducks in front of a duck and one duck in the middle of other ducks.</p> <p><strong>How many ducks were there in the pond? </strong></p> <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Three ducks!</p> <p>What! How? Well, read the riddle carefully! When there are three ducks, two will be infront of the last one, two will be behind the front one and the middle was is accompanied with the two ducks at each end.</p> <h2>Farmer’s Trip</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-217.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>A farmer had a sack of corn and was going to town with two of his pets: A goose and duck. He came across a stream and found a tiny boat on the shoreline, now the boat was too small to transport three of them so he decided to take one thing at a time. But feared that if he sent the fox with goose, it would eat it. If he sent the goose with sack of corns, then the goose will eat the corns.</p> <p><strong>What is the right and safe way for the three of them? </strong></p> <p>Answer: The farmer took the goose first and return, then took the fox and returned with the goose, then took the sack of corns and left the goose behind, then finally he brought the goose back to the other side of the stream to move towards the town for business.</p> <p>Pretty simple but tricky right?</p> <h2>Paul’s Good At Math!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-218.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>Paul tells his friend Pete that he scored 20% more in math test. Pete’s score on the test is 80/100 and his friends think that Paul scored 100/100.</p> <p><strong>That’s an astonishing score but do you think Paul really scored a 100 in the test? </strong></p> <p><strong>Answer: </strong>No. As you read that Paul told Pete that he scored 20% more than him, that means that he actually scored 96/100 in his test. HOW? Well 20% of 80 is 16, if you do the math then it makes 80+16=96, which is Paul’s test score.</p> <p>Still trying to figure out what just happened? Let’s move to the next riddle.</p> <h2>This One Is So Heatingly Tricky!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-219.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>I’m not alive, yet I grow; I don’t have lungs, yet I need air; I don’t have a mouth, yet I drown.</p> <p><strong>What Am I? </strong></p> <p><strong>Answer</strong>: Fire!</p> <p>Fire isn’t alive but it grows pretty fast, it doesn’t have lungs but needs air to grow and spread, it also doesn’t have a mouth but put into water, it drowns and dies.</p> <p>You didn’t notice the heading of this riddle carefully, right? Read it again.</p> <p><em>Well I gave you spoilers!</em></p> <h2>The Smith Family</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-220.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>Each son in this family has just as many brothers as sisters, but each daughter has twice as many brothers as sisters.</p> <p><strong>How many boys and girls are in the family?</strong></p> <p><strong>Answer: </strong>There are 4 Boys and 3 Girls in the smith family.</p> <p>Every sister has 2 other sisters and 4 brothers. Just like that, every brother has 3 brothers and 3 sisters. Puzzling isn’t it? But focusing clearly on it wouldn’t stump you for long, mate.</p> <h2>Larry’s Brothers!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-221.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>Larry’s father has five sons namely Matt, Smith, Harris and Peter.</p> <p><strong>Can you guess the name of the fifth son?</strong></p> <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Look at the heading! Well I gave you another spoiler but you didn’t notice. The answer is<strong> Larry!</strong></p>     <p>When Larry’s father has four sons with different names, you could’ve noticed that Larry wasn’t mentioned in the four names, which obviously makes him the 5th heir.</p> <p><em>This one was pretty obvious! </em></p> <h2>Anyone Can Hold Me</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-222.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>Anyone can hold me even without their hands yet no one can do it for long.</p> <p><strong>What am I?</strong></p> <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Your breath!</p> <p>You can hold your breath without your hands but if you do it for longer, it might end you up passed out on the floor. This dizzying riddle is so tricky, It makes me think I’m dumb!</p> <h2>How Old Are You?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-223.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>When asked how old she was, Anne replied, “In two years, I will be twice as old as I was five years ago.”</p> <p><strong>How old is she?</strong></p> <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Anne is 12 years old.</p> <p>How? Well Five years ago, she was 7 years old and in two years, she will be twice that age, i.e. 14 years. So right now this makes Anne 12 years old today!</p> <p><em>Good luck coping up with adolescence, Anne! </em></p> <h2>Sal, Sam and Steve!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-224.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>Sal and Sam are brothers. Steve is Sal’s son and he’s 12 years younger than his Uncle while Sal is twice as old as Steve. Four years ago, Sal was the same age as Sam is now and he was also twice as old as his nephew.</p> <p><strong>Tell us the ages of Sam, Steve and Sal? </strong></p> <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Sal is 32, Sam is 28 and Steve is 16.</p> <p>Steve is 12 years younger than his Uncle Sam and Sal was the same age as Sam some four years ago. If you do the math, then 32, 28 and 16 are the most fitting numbers or ages which are connecting with Sam, Sal and Steve.</p> <p>Sal is 32, making him 28 four years back (Same as Sam) and Steve is basically half his dad’s age. Which tells us that Sal was a daddy at age 16! WOW!</p> <h2>Three Doctors!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-225.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>Three doctors said that Rob was their brother but Rob claims he has no brothers.</p> <p><strong>Who is the liar here? </strong></p> <p><strong>Answer: </strong>No one, the three doctors were Rob’s sisters.</p> <p>The thought was actually circling around who was the liar amongst these four people and covered the logic of gender where you never realized that women can be doctors, too.</p> <p>One thing is for sure, though! Rob has free health care for infinity!</p> <h2>I don’t know what to say!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-226.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>What occurs once in a minute, twice in a moment and never in a thousand years?</p> <p>Answer: The letter <strong>M</strong></p> <p>This riddle actually needed a review of smallest of details. The letter M is actually present once in the word “Minute”, twice in the word “Moment” and not mentioned in “A Thousand Years” at all.</p> <p>Get it now?</p> <h2>Wait, What?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-227.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>You throw away the outside, eat the inside and throw away the inside.</p> <p><strong>What is it? </strong></p> <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Corn</p> <p>If you have eaten corn on cob, then you might have noticed that the outer skin is usually peeled and thrown, when you eat the delicious corn seeds off the cob, what’s left behind is that useless inner part which is also thrown away.</p> <p><em>This riddle is stumping!</em></p> <h2>Pencil on the floor!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-228.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>How can you place a pencil on the floor so no one jumps over it?</p> <p><strong>Answer</strong>: If you keep the pencil next to the wall.</p> <p>Well this makes sense, if you actually keep the pencil next to a wall, no one would ever dare to jump over it and well, if someone gives it a try, a concrete wall hug would be memorable. But the question arises on WHY a person wouldn’t want anyone to jump over his pencil?</p> <p>Superstition? Let us know in the comment section below.</p> <p>Well these riddles were pretty stumping, weren’t they? I must say, these are no doubt created by brilliant minds who know how to trick a human brain but what’s more awesome is that trying to solve these riddles can actually make you more vigilant in un-coding many things around you on a deeper level. Moreover, it is not necessary that you should be a child or adolescent to practice these all day, those ones were to make us sharp and these are the ones which makes you vigilant.</p>     <p>What more riddles do you know?
