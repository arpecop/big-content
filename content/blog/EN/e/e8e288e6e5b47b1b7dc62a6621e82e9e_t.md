         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -1<p><img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/c-users-ammar-ahmed-downloads-23-11-2990-jpg.jpeg"/></p> <p>Kevin Spacey is an actor, producer, director, screenwriter and singer who stared in the award winning political drama, ‘the house of cards’ from 2013-2017. Kevin Spacey played the role of President Frank Underwood and the star has been nominated for several awards for playing this character.</p> <p>However, following some serious allegations of sexual misconduct against Kevin Spacey, the show has been cancelled with its last season’s production suspended indefinitely. According to Tvline, Kevin Spacey was fired from the show on November 3rd.</p> <p>The first allegation was made by the actor Anthony Rapp who claims that Kevin Spacey made sexual advances towards him when he was 14 back in 1986. This was followed by several other people coming forward with similar claims. He tweeted apologizing and naming it ‘a deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour’. While no apologies can fix the wounds of those affected, if the incident is indeed true. However, fans of the house of cards have an ongoing petition about replacing Kevin Spacey on the famous show.</p> <p>While we cannot predict when or if the season six will air, what we can give you is 13 interesting replacements for Kevin Spacey in the House of Cards.</p> <h2>13. Edward Norton</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1386.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>This actor is the perfect combination of great acting skills and killer looks. He was also nominated for three Academy Awards for his various roles that only further provide proof of his mastery over his skill. Every actor brings a bit of themselves in the character they play on-screen. So, it would be interesting to watch how Edward Norton would play the role.</p> <h2>12. Robert Downey Jr</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1387.jpeg"/>wikimedia <p>This man needs no introduction. He is one of the highest paid actors in Hollywood and has won many awards including two Golden Globes. Even though his previous roles differ greatly form the role of President Frank, it would be refreshing to see him give his take to the character. This will also be beneficial for the show as trying to get another Kevin Spacey is almost impossible. So, Robert would an altogether different flavour to the show.</p> <h2>11. Tom Hanks</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1388.jpeg"/>wikimedia <p>The Oscar winning actor is famous for his ‘good guy’ roles. However, his acting skills know no match in Hollywood. So why not have this gorgeous double Oscar winner replace Kevin Spacey and work his magic on screen?</p> <h2>10. Bryan Cranston</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1389.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>Did you know that Bryan Cranston has portrayed President Lyndon B. Johnson in the biopic ‘All the way’? He’s the man with perfect qualifications for this job. Not to mention he has also won an Emmy for his hit show ‘Breaking Bad’. He is the ideal combination of age, looks, and experience needed to play the role of President Frank to perfection.</p> <h2>9. Christopher Plummer</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1390.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>In the upcoming movie ‘All the money’, Christopher Plummer is replacing Kevin Spacey and the film is going to be reshot. The legendary Christopher Plummer who is 88 years old has won several awards and accolades including an Academy Award, two Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe. Who knows he could be the next choice of the producers to replace Kevin Spacey in House of Cards too.</p> <h2>8. Kevin James</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1391.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>There is a petition making rounds on the internet that suggests the best replacement would be someone with their first name as Kevin. Even though Kevin James is a comedian, at this point any Kevin but Kevin Spacey will work.</p>     <h2>7. Kevin Costner</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1392.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>Another Kevin on the list who all though has taken up his long-term passion for singing, he has not turned his back to acting. Not one but this two Academy Awards winning actor could be just waiting for the right script and the House of Cards might give him that opportunity.</p> <h2>6. John Hamm</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1393.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>Best known for his role in ‘Madmen’, he has proven his mettle in acting. An additional benefit for the show could be that of his huge fan base, which he would like to introduce the show into, if he replaces Kevin Spacey.</p> <h2>5. Michael Keaton</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1394.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>Michael Keaton has done several various kinds of roles over the span of his career from starring in dramas, thrillers to romantic movies, he has done them all. Do you know what’s common between Keaton and the character of President Frank? They are both democrats! Regardless of party affiliations, if the show producers look for replacements, he should be among the top choices.</p> <h2>4. Joe Manganiello</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1395.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>You can never get enough of this face. So why not have him on the show?</p> <h2>3. Anthony Rapp</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1396.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>Who better to replace Kevin Spacey with than the man who led to the downfall of Kevin Spacey?</p> <h2>2. Keifer Sutherland</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1397.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>The Emmy Award winner maybe one of the better choices as he even has experience playing the President of the United States previously. He checks most boxes on the list of criteria to replace Kevin, including the fact that he has previously stared in negative roles in movies like ‘Phonebooth’ and ‘A time to kill’. So, he most definitely has what it takes to give an interesting performance and bring his own flavour to the show.</p> <h2>1. Donald Trump</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1398.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>Who wouldn’t want to see Donald Trump give up his role as a president to play a former President on TV. We would happily accept the switch provided he steps away from his role as the actual president of United States.</p> <p>While the storyline has moved in a direction that the script writers could work their magic and side line Kevin’s character to even introduce a new character or kill his character to avoid any hassle. Speaking of new characters, why not have more female power on the show. Our very own Gal Gado, famously known for playing the ‘Wonder Woman’, could play a badass politician. Couldn’t she? When it comes to female actors, there is a whole new entire world of talent that could be explored.</p>     <p>All said, we do hope the producers of the show at least decide to give the fans some closure by airing Season Six soon!</p>   <i></i>
