Either those relationships end or sometimes the marriage does but there are times when we get to hear shocking brutal stories of revenge; sometimes, we see the spouse forgiving the others; sometimes, we hear amusing stories of wit and patience. Well, this is about one of those real-time stories in which the husband left a note for the guy with whom his wife was cheating with.</p> <p>The note was long and had a practical list of things-to-do for the guy to be careful of while visiting his wife. The husband asked the guy to stop leaving the seat up since he was the one who got blamed for it, to not drink all his beer though he said it was okay for him to drink a couple because you do need the beer to find his wife attractive, he further asked him to buy a beer and leave it at the house before leaving or at least leave money for a beer so that the husband himself could pick it up from the store, the husband asked him to replace the toilet paper if it ended since his 5 years old kid thought it was okay not to wipe if there is no toilet paper, the husband requested him to use something disposable for cleaning out after making love and mentioned that often his own clothes which are clean in the basket are used and since his wife does not do the washing it is hard for him to manage it all by himself, he asked him to hide their relationship from the kids since they are too little to cope with it.</p> <p>Well, the note does not end here. The husband also asked him to stop turning the heat up since it is he who pays the bills. The funniest but the most logical thing the husband asked him to do was to say no if his wife asks if she looks fat in certain pants no matter what because even if he would be right it won’t do the husband any good since she would go out and get new pants in which she would look just the way she is but with a little less money in the husband’s account. He also asked him strictly to not eat baked good since they are mostly from his mom; the husband mentioned the brownies which the guy ate but those were baked by the husband’s mother on his birthday. The husband asks him to keep shifting his weight while using his chair since the recliner has a groove in it which compels the husband to roll on his left.</p> <p>In the end, the husband thanked the guy for taking him out on Valentine’s day because later when the husband took her out she ordered less food and he was now able to take the kids to the movies. He told him that it would be really easy for both of them if they did it all with a bit of compromise. Though it was clear from the letter that the husband did not like his wife much.</p> <p>This situation could have been quite challenging to handle but the husband dealt it with patience and wit. He was well aware of the situation and didn’t feel an obligation to pretend to be emotional.</p> <h1>What if your spouse is cheating on you?</h1> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-730.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Have you thought what would you do if you found out that your spouse is cheating on you? Would you cry and panic, would you plan out a dreadful revenge, would you simply seek out separation, or would you leave a note to your spouse or the person she is cheating on you with?</p>     <p>Well, here is the list of few things you should and should not be doing.</p> <h2>Take some deep breaths</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-731.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Yeah, that is the first thing: Stay calm. Do not panic! Because if you do, you ruin all what little is left to your marriage. Especially, if you love your spouse, do not do this because it would only scare them off and since he or she already did it because some kind of insecurity so be patient. Even though it is hard but there is no better advice than to stay calm and think before you are ready to about it.</p> <h2>Look out for places where you have been wrong</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-732.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If your spouse is cheating on you, do not blame them. Rather look at where have you been wrong that your spouse felt a need to go to someone else for comfort and love. It surely has been your fault too at some point. So learn to see and accept your mistakes. Also, if nothing settles down your relationship back to normal, choose the option of therapy which might really work even though it seems cliché and you feel like you know everything better already. Therapy sure helps.</p> <h2>What do you need from your partner and what do they need?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-733.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>You gotta point out your needs because if you won’t there is no way you can get to a solution that would work. Don’t make the cheating a matter of moral rather think it practically and identify where have your needs not been met by your partner or where have you been lacking. Open up your heart and be ready to listen. Do not let the things bury up inside you because they won’t be there for long and would hurt your relationship again so solve it all once and for all.</p>     <p>If you are ever faced with the situation, do not choose separation or divorce as your first option which is usually the first things people want to do. Try to work it out because if you married them, you sure thought it all that was the right person for you. So, don’t look back instead, look forward and accept. Not everyone can be as cool as the husband who left the note. Ha! Good luck with your spouses.</p>   <i></i>
