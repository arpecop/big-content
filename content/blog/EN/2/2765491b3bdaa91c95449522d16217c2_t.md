         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -1<p>If you follow the law accordingly, then you should never have to worry about getting put in handcuffs. However, not everyone makes the best decisions in life and they end up getting placed behind the bars. Yet, sometimes it’s the most fascinating folks who get their mugshot put out there and reaches Internet fame.</p> <p>Here are 10 odd people who people that got arrested…</p> <h2><strong>Say My Name</strong></h2> <p>Okay, what gives? This guys looks pretty normal right? Well certainly looks can be deceiving. But before you start hollering and asking for a refund, there’s a method to our madness. But first can you guess what his name is?</p> <p>You need to think a bit creatively, or drink heavily to make a guess. His name is Beezow Doo Doo Zopittybop Bop Bop, Just in case you are wondering, I didn’t had a stroke or something and I wasn’t even quoting lyrics to MMMBOP, that’s really the guys name…</p>  <p>And then there's the American, Mr. Beezow Doo-doo Zopittybop-bop-bop pic.twitter.com/DqMr6xqbgW</p> <p>— Mr. B (@Benogola) June 3, 2017</p> <p></p> <p>Zopittybop Bop Bop legally changed his name from Jeffrey Drew Wilschke to what it is now. Remember that episode of “FRIENDS” where Phoebe changed her name to “ Princess Consuela Banana Hammock” and her husband Mike changed his to “Crap Bag”</p> <p>So Basically. Zopittybop was arrested for assaulting a campus police officer. But before they went down, Zopittybop Bop Bop was tearing down fliers and also tried to bite the officer’s ring finger several times.</p> <p>Some people’s children… But in case you are tired of your name and want to name yourself after science fiction aliens reject, the sky is the limit!</p> <h2><strong>Highway To Hell</strong></h2> <p>How much do you love your favorite band? Do you love them enough to blast only one of their songs for 26 hours?</p> <p>That’s exactly what happened to Joyce Coffey.She was initially asked to keep the volume down while she was blasting AC/DC’s “Highway To Hell” she didn’t heed it, and ended up getting arrested.</p>  <p>Joyce Coffey was arrested four times in 26 hours for blasting AC/DC – Highway to Hell. Omfg I just can't pic.twitter.com/9E3f1HCuzw</p> <p>— № (@Ophiologist) July 14, 2013</p> <p></p> <p>Five hours later, Coffey was freed and she went home to once again blast “Highway To Hell” then, she was arrested again, re-released, and went home to continue blasting “Highway To Hell” or maybe she was just trying to get placed behind the bars.</p> <p>Once she got home before dawn, her nephew came over to retrieve some of his stuff. As soon as he entered into her home, she threw a frying pan at him.</p> <p>When she had her court date, the judge told Coffey that maybe she should consider wearing headphones instead of blasting “Highway To Hell”</p> <h2><strong>What A Gas</strong></h2> <p>Oh, where to start with this one. This is another situation where the guy looks fairly normal. But he was arrested for something quite odd.</p> <p>So, Lets start from the beginning and talk about gas. It’s a natural part of our day, even if it can be gross at times. We are not talking about gas for your car, but the kind of gas you get after having too much fun at “Taco Tuesday” sure, the stench can be pretty bad, but could it ever be so bad that you get arrested?</p> <p>That’s what happened to 34-year old Jose Cruz, he was initially pulled over for driving without headlights and then arrested for driving under the influence. Once he got to the police station, he needed to use the bathroom and that was their fatal mistake. As Cruz was being taken into a room for a Breathalyzer test, he passed gas and apparently fanned it towards the officer.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2213-1-jpg.jpeg"/>Dlisted.com <p>The charges were eventually dropped, but the victim of Cruz gas made a huge stink about the incident. And said Cruz was trying to assault him.</p> <p>If that’s the case, a lot of us would be getting arrested for passing gas and a Dutch oven could be considered manslaughter?</p> <h2><strong>Legit Photo</strong></h2> <p>When you see this photo you might think it was photoshopped. Certainly someone couldn’t live through life. Let alone still retain cognitive thinking when their head looks like this! But it’s a real photo, and the guy’s name is Carlos Sosa Rodriguez. He is also known as halfy because he literally only has about half of his head.</p> <p>After he was arrested for soliciting a prostitute, his mugshot went viral and he ended up getting his 15 minutes of fame. For him to still be alive is nothing short of higher power watching over him. But how he ended up with the front half of his head flattened should have gotten him nominated for Darwin Awards.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2213-2-jpg.jpeg"/>imgur <p>Rodriguez was driving and he was under the influence of more stuff than just alcohol… if you catch out drift. He ended up hitting a pole and he flew out through the windshield and landed on his head. His being alive is nothing short of a medical miracle, but it seems like he’s still getting himself into some trouble.</p> <p>You would think having an experience of almost becoming a ghost would make him rethink his decisions and turn his life around.</p> <h2><strong>Worst Disguise Ever</strong></h2> <p>When you are about to commit a crime, it is most likely that you want to keep your face covered as much as possible. How to pull that off? With a disguise! Most criminals will go for the ski mask or even pantyhose to distort their face.</p> <p>What did Matthew Allan McNelly and Joey Lee Miller decide to do? Color their faces with permanent marker, yep… not even kidding. And not just that, they didn’t even do a decent job at it.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2213-3-jpg.jpeg"/>imgur <p>How in the world did the pass elementary school? The two men were wearing hooded sweatshirts when they tried breaking into a house in Iowa. They weren’t successful, but their attempt drew enough attention to get the people called on them.</p> <p>When the two men were pulled over, the cops couldn’t believe what they saw. Given that the evidence was literally written on their faces, investigators had no problem. Bringing McNelly and Miller into custody not only were the two men charged with attemted burglary, but McNelly was also charged with driving while intoxicated. Well maybe if they had a bit too much drink, that might explain the epically poor decision-making.</p> <h2><strong>Butter Her Up</strong></h2> <p>Living with a roommate can either be awesome or terrible… all depending on what kind of relationship you have. For example: they say that you should never live with your best friend. Because when you realize you cant live with each other, the friendship ends.</p>     <p>But at the same time living with a stranger could end just as badly and lead to some intense disagreements. In this situation you could say that Dawn Elizabeth Rhash failed to butter up her male roommate. She got into a disagreement with him over food in the fridge and what belonged to whom.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2213-4-jpg.jpeg"/>imgur <p>Apparently the disagreement escalated into a fight, and Rhash threw a stick of butter at her roommate, who then called the police. When deputies arrived, there was butter on the roommate’s ankle.</p> <p>Big whoop that was the cunning piece of evidence that got her arrested, Rhash’s mugshot soon went viral not only for her crime. But also for her uniqueness, she doesn’t necessarily look like a savage butter-wielding criminal but more like the crazy aunt that lives next door with lots of cats.</p> <p>She was eventually charged with misdemeanor buttery… opps, I mean battery.</p> <h2><strong>Desperation</strong></h2> <p>If you want something bad enough, how far are you willing to go to get it? Also, remember how your mom said to always wear clean underwear because you don’t know what will happen to you? Well you also never know when you will have your picture taken. Stoney Dubbs probably takes the cake for having the weirdest mugshot ever. What was the crime? He really wanted some beer and marijuana, and he was willing to put out his services so to speak. Meaning he was willing to sell himself in order to have some good time. But the problem was that one of his potential customers was an undercover cop. He was texting said cop and offering himself in exchange for booze and pot.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2213-5-jpg.jpeg"/>thecouriertimes.com <p>Dubbs was arrested and his mugshot was released to the public. Maybe it’s the eyebrows and the thin eyeliner line across the face. Maybe it’s the crazy lipstick and eye shadow. And how about that lip liner? Dubbs definitely was looking like he was ready to have a good time, and his makeup looks like he was about to get on stage for a stage for a drag show.</p> <p>Actually drag queens do their makeup a lot better than that, sorry, RU. Anyway, Dubbs definitely has the same face a kid would have when they are caught sticking their hands into the cookie jar.</p> <h2><strong>Lessons Not Learned </strong></h2> <p>This is a case where someone clearly didn’t learn their lesson after a personal tragedy. When you are a kid, if you burn your hand on the stove, you quickly learn that you shouldn’t ever touch a hot stove again. It’s human nature and it’s basically common sense.</p> <p>If you look at Heather Raybon’s mugshot from 2003, she looks like an average person, except she was arrested on meth related charges. But her 2006 mugshot is completely terrifying.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2213-6-jpg.jpeg"/>imgur <p>What happened to her? She was caught in a meth explosion in 2004 and her face nearly melted off because of the third degree burns. You would think that after nearly losing her life and causing permanent damage to her face, she would walk away from that life and never want to go back. Well, she went back and kept going back. Based on her mugshots, she seems to continue to have repair work done to her face. But, her arrests are all related to meth charges. If she really wanted to take progression shots of how her face has recovered, taking selfie is a lot cheaper. So clearly we have a classic case of someone who wont ever learn their lesson</p> <h2><strong>Garlic Knot Life</strong></h2> <p>For anyone that has ordered food before, it can be annoying when the restaurant or establishment messes on the order. Maybe they added onion, or they forgot the side ranch. It’s something that happens in life. And we have to take it in stride even if we are feeling really disgruntled.</p> <p>We might feel like hitting someone if a part of the order is missing. But, average people don’t ever dream of doing something like that because jail time isn’t worth a missed side of fries, or in this case… Garlic knots.</p> <p>48-year old Robert Weeler was so mad that the Domino’s Pizza delivery guy forgot his order of garlic knots. Usually you would just call the restaurant and they would send the garlic knots over as soon as possible. But Wheeler wanted vengeance and justice for his garlic knots. How dare the delivery guy prevent this union from happening!</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2213-7-jpg.jpeg"/>imgur <p>It doesn’t help that Wheeler was clocked in weighing around 340 pounds and there were plenty of fat jokes to go around. From looking at wheelers mugshot, he might have been under the influence of other things. Plus, there were probably some emotional issues going about.</p> <h2><strong>Nightmares</strong></h2> <p>So when it comes to odd people, this final mugshot takes the cake. In April 2017, 24- year old Morgan Joyce Varn was arrested after a standoff with the SWAT team for kidnapping and robbery. When her Mugshot was released to the public, people were both fascinated and horrified because, Varn was not only covered in tattoos, but also she had her eyeballs tattooed. This isn’t the first time Varn made the news.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2213-8-jpg.jpeg"/>imgur <p>In 2015, she couldn’t make it to the hospital in time to deliver her baby girl and so police officers had to assist in the birth. The media went nuts and gave her plenty of press coverage, which meant that her arrest got even more coverage.</p>     <p>Maybe Varn got with the wrong crowd after the birth. But given that she refused to let the police into her home after her partner stole a cellphone from a guy, she has certainly dug herself into a deep hole.</p>   <i></i>
