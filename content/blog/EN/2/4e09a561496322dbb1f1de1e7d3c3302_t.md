         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 1<p>Watching a movie is one of the most popular ways to unwind. What makes a movie great is the perfect combination of acting skills, storyline and the execution of the plot. If the actors are not convincing in their roles, the chances are that you will not enjoy the movie as much as you could have. Owing to this fact, actors spend months in advance in preparing for their roles. Most of them have to undergo serious physical transformations in order to fit into their roles correctly. At times makeup and special effects can do the trick whereas, sometimes actors need to gain or lose considerable amounts of weight to look like their characters. Here are 19 actors who went through phenomenal weight transformations for their roles in films.</p> <h2>15. Christian Bale, “The Machinist” (2004)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1153.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>Christian Bale is undoubtedly one of the most deserving people here. Not only for losing drastic weight for his film, The Machinist, but also for immediately following this loss by bulking back right after it to play the iconic Batman. Gaining a staggering 100 pounds in a mere six months that too mostly muscle mass is insanely hard. However, it was in Brad Anderson’s “The Machinist” in which Bale showed his greatest transformation yet. Bale lost a monumental 60 pounds by going on a diet that consisted largely of coffees and apples.</p> <h2>14. Charlize Theron, “Monster” (2003)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1155.jpeg"/>Wikipedia <p>Weight gain, while immense, was only a small fraction of the total effort that the gorgeous model Charlize Theron had to undergo in order to convincingly portray the serial killer Aileen Wuornos in Patty Jenkins’ “Monster.” Apart from gaining enough weight to transform her appearance completely, Theron also had to have her skin smothered with washed off tattoo ink to give it a weathered appearance, her eyebrows were partially shaven, and her mane of hair was repeatedly thinned and fried. However, the extensive work helped Theron pick up an Academy Award!</p> <h2>13. Robert De Niro, “Raging Bull” (1980)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1157.jpeg"/>cdn-mf1.heartyhosting <p>Robert De Niro’s weight gain for his role of Jake La Motta is nothing short of legendary. He proceeded to pack on massive 60 pounds to accurately portray the immense girth of the previously great boxer gone to waste. De Niro’s method is also probably the most enjoyable we’ve heard of: during a 4-month break from filming designed solely for the purpose of gaining weight, he ate his way around Italy and France before returning to film the movie’s ending scenes. Imagine all the cheese and pasta!</p> <h2>12. Jared Leto, “Chapter 27” (2007)</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1159.jpeg"/>Wikipedia <p>“Dallas Buyers Club” was not the solitary time that the 30 Seconds to Mars leading man, Jared Leto, had to undergo a severely dramatic weight change for a role.
