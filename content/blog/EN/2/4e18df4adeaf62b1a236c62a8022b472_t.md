         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -2<p><img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-18-12-3482-01-jpg.jpeg"/></p> <p>Marriage or relationships in general are based on mutual agreement between two people who are striving for each other’s permanent company in life. To figure out if you are mentally ready to accept that person, one needs to slow down and evaluate each step before making a lifetime commitment. Sometimes what you want isn’t what your partner will want, which is completely fine but if it is something you are not comfortable with you need to address it. Don’t just follow the tide because you want to impress your potential wife or husband because there will be many regrets later.</p> <h2>10. Make a checklist for your goals:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-702.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>Find a quiet place to dwell on this. Grab a pen and paper and write down where you want to see this relationship go and when you want to see it go there. Write down the things you want to do before you get married like achieve self-actualization or a career. This way you would understand what you want and pace it accordingly.</p> <h2>9. Pace yourself:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-703.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>If you feel like you are jumping into the marriage a bit too fast, try pacing yourself. Not just yourself but your partner as well. Identify the areas that irritate you or make you uncomfortable and cut them away from your life.</p> <p>These things could just even be verbal. Like you have not even decided that you want to get married to this particular person let alone have children with them and what they do is start dropping hints about wanting kids etc. It is time to draw the line and tell them to take one step at a time.</p> <h2>8. Talking to your potential Spouse:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-704.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>When you generally feel uncomfortable it is best if you talk about it. This is what a healthy relationship is naturally based on. Healthy communication.</p> <p>Your partner won’t be able to identify your goals or thoughts for the relationship by just reading your mind, he or she needs to know when you tell them. This is the most important step in slowing a relationship down. If you can’t talk to your partner right now about stuff that makes you uncomfortable, just stop and think about it for a second. How will you spend the rest of your life with them?</p> <h2>7. Turning the same pages:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-705.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>Like we mentioned earlier, communication is key. If you want your partner to understand you then you need to talk to them about it. Living in two different realities is a bad idea and it is something that is bound to happen because two people entering a relationship enter it with different expectations and mind sets.</p> <p>As an equal participant you should know about theirs and they should know about yours. This way you both can find a middle ground to pace yourself at.</p>     <h2>6. Take some alone time:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-706.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>Indulging in alone time is often beneficial. This will give you time to establish your mental peace and also give you time to understand where you stand on the relationship ground and if you wish to be rooted there or not. Allow your friends to help you find this peace and make good decisions. This alone time will help you come to terms with a lot of things without feeling guilty, anxious and overwhelmed.</p> <h2>5. Eye to eye:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-707.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>When you tell your potential spouse about what is bothering you and how you want to go about your relationship their reaction is the possible determining factor for your decision to move on with the relationship or not. If they respect your decisions and decide to cater to your needs then they are a keeper. If they get offended but still cater to your needs you still need to evaluate the pros and cons of the relationship.</p> <p>The last and hopefully a scenario you don’t have to encounter is when he or she pretends to understand your limits yet does not actually follow those prescribed boundaries and limits.</p> <h2>4. Find mutual grounds:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-708.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>Like we mentioned earlier you and your potential spouse enter the relationship on different grounds and realities this does not mean you can’t find a mutual ground or even create one for that matter. Try exploring and find that land of potential freedom or equality. If you want to keep the relationship going you need to find a stable ground to make it work otherwise you are just going to be a part of the titanic.</p> <h2>3. Identify the right time:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-709.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>There are steps that one takes in a relationship to move forward. Call them levels in a game that should potentially mean a lot to you. Establish what these levels are and do it with your potential partner to establish a level of equality and so that you take their comfort level into account as well.</p> <h2>2. Talk to them about their boundaries as well:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-710.jpeg"/> Shutterstock <p>This is a very important part of the relationship. The give and take part. You need to ask your partner what they like and dislike about your relationship as well. If you take what they like into account as well they are most likely to respect what you like and dislike about the relationship too. This also allows you to have a relatively healthy relationship.</p> <h2>1. Don’t hold back when it feels right:</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-711.jpeg"/> Shutterstock     <p>Working on a whim is not usually recommended but you should remember that you shouldn’t emotionally hold back just for the sake of it. Go up the levels hand in hand so that either no one is left behind or no one charges forward which might just cause further problems.</p>   <i></i>
