Show casing their glamorous albeit drama filled life on the television and social media, showing nothing and absolutely nothing is private in their life. From marriage to their divorces everything is open for the world to see because of their reality TV show ‘Keeping up with the Kardashians.’ Anyone and everyone who watches that show knows anything and everything that happens in the life of these celebrities. Here are some facts that the reality show itself might have not told you but we definitely will.</p>      <p> Kardashian Decade #kendall #kim #kris #khloe #kourtney #kyle #thekardashian #kardashiansisters #kardashianstyle #dashfashion</p> <p>A post shared by The Kardashian’s Fashion (@dash_enthusiast) on Dec 3, 2017 at 11:48pm PST</p>   <p></p> <h2>10. Mommager Kris, loving or not?</h2>      <p>A post shared by kriskardashian (@kriskardashiann) on Oct 27, 2014 at 2:05pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>We all thought that Kris, the mother bear and the manager of the Kardashian clan loved her children and wanted what is best for them. Some of you might agree to disagree but one person who does not believe the love and care the Kardashians exhibit for each other is Kim’s late father Robert Kardashian Senior’s Wife Ellen. Ellen revealed to the media that she came across some of Robert Kardashian Senior’s old journals where he had documented some of his life with Kris and about their children too. In the journals Robert Senior dictated that Kris was not patient with Kourtney and Kim when they were younger. She was a very angry mom. Yikes, our hearts go out to little Kim and Kourtney.</p> <h2>9. Who is her daddy?</h2> <p>The journals that were mentioned previously also talk about Kris Jenner’s unfaithful ways when she was married to Robert Kardashian. Shocking. Any guesses on who it was? Yes that is right OJ Simpson, the renowned man who was being defended by Rob Kardashian Senior himself. Scandalous. The news that followed this was even more shocking. Khloe, the youngest of the Kardashian clan was not Robert Kardashian Senior’s daughter either! Nor is she Bruce Jenner’s daughter. It was rumored that she is OJ Simpson’s daughter and well three other supposed candidates but Khloe has since then ignored these rumors and refused to take a paternity test as well.</p>      <p> 💕 I choose to start each day with a grateful heart and a happy state of mind 💕</p> <p>A post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on Nov 30, 2017 at 1:19pm PST</p>   <p></p> <h2>8. The Jenner mansion not really owned by the Jenner’s?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-4-12-3089-03-jpg.jpeg"/>dailymail <p>We all know celebrities who love showing off their wealth and the wealth their homes display. Have you ever considered the publicity loving Kardashians might have other things they care more about? Like their security. The Jenner home which has often been shown in the reality show is known as a hoax which is located 8 miles from the Kardashians actual home. The reason they even shoot there is because they don’t want to give away their actual location and then be streamed with stalkers etc.</p> <h2>7. The Tear stick</h2>      <p> Ultralight Beams highlighters &amp; glosses launching Dec 1st on KKWBEAUTY.COM 📸 @marcelocantuphoto</p> <p>A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Nov 27, 2017 at 9:20pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>The classy and ever so fabulous Kim Kardashian who loves staying fresh for the camera has known to have the ugliest crying face in Hollywood. And Kim is completely fine with that. Why? Because Publicity is the Kardashian’s best friend. Kim is known to use a tear stick under her eyes which can help her generate actual tears and well the rest is history.</p> <h2>6. Blac Chyna, all hate no love</h2>      <p> Walking away from the drama like… 🏃🏽#throwback</p> <p>A post shared by ROBERT KARDASHIAN (@robkardeshian) on Nov 4, 2017 at 1:12pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>The Kardashian’s tried really hard to be supportive of their brother Robert and his relationship with Chyna who was a former stripper and the mother of Kylie’s then boyfriend’s child. It was turning into a weird family tree but all the Kardashian’s were shown to be really upset by the relationship especially since it was effecting Rob’s health really negatively especially the fighting that took place between Rob and Chyna. On the surface they pretended they were cool with the former stripper but deep down they were seething with discontent.</p>     <h2>5. Are all the moments on reality television real?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-4-12-3089-06-jpg.jpeg"/>theproposers      <p> WOW! Det er hvad jeg kalder et frieri! 😳😍 #KUWTK #season9 #kanyewestproposal #såsmukt #allepigerburdehaveenfyrsomkanye #såsmukt</p> <p>A post shared by Maria Rosgaard Hansen 🌸 (@mariarosgaardhansen) on Sep 5, 2014 at 1:44am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Let’s talk about both of Kim’s proposals. They were picture perfect. Too perfect. A source revealed even though the intention behind the proposals was genuine, the proposals were re-enacted for the Keeping up with the Kardashian show to generate more publicity. This did not happen just once but twice, once with Kris Humphries and once with Kanye West, during which they had to have several retakes because Kim was not happy with her surprised expression.</p> <h2>4. Baby Dream</h2>      <p> Dream as Raggedy Ann</p> <p>A post shared by Blac Chyna (@blacchyna) on Oct 31, 2017 at 5:04pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Baby Dream, the child of Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna graced the family not long after the couple came out with their relationship. Instead of being happy the entire Kardashian clan was shown to be rather upset about the baby on the way especially the children loving Khloe who openly voiced her disappointment. Even though baby dream was greeted with utmost love when she came into the world, little did she know that most of her Aunts were not happy when she was on the way.</p> <h2>3. Fake Pregnancy attempts</h2>      <p> 👑 Moon of my life 👑</p> <p>A post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on Oct 31, 2017 at 2:37pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Khloe, the youngest of the Kardashian clan has always won people’s hearts when she is playing with her nieces and nephews, treating them like they are her own. The Kardashian has also broken many people’s hearts when they have seen her getting upset over not being able to get pregnant by her former husband Lamar Odom. The reality show has had its fair share of Khloe’s pregnancy scares which turned out to be disappointingly not true. The Kardashian recently revealed on Cocktails with Khloe that even though she loved kids and wanted them at the time she knew she wasn’t in a situation to have them since her marriage was falling apart which led to her lying to her then husband instead of just coming clean about not wanting to have a baby with him.</p> <h2>2. Kris and Caitlyn</h2>      <p> I'm trying something new with my hair. What do you think of the color and style?</p> <p>A post shared by Caitlyn Jenner (@caitlynjenner) on Oct 9, 2017 at 11:36am PDT</p>   <p></p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-4-12-3089-09-jpg.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>We all know about the ever so famous transition of Bruce Jenner to Caitlyn Jenner. Caitlyn Jenner recently came out with a book that is known as her memoir and letting people know what led up to her transition and her life before that. In the book Caitlyn states that Kris knew about her gender identity crisis before she got married to her. Caitlyn also went on to say that Kris knew about the inner woman Caitlyn was struggling to hide before Kris had even slept with her. Kris after reading the book was furious claiming she did not know about Caitlyn’s struggle to become Caitlyn till years into the marriage. The whole thing has been accused of being a publicity stunt from both sides, but who knows.</p> <h2>1. Lips don’t lie</h2>      <p> TODAY ONLY we are doing a 2 for $20 Gloss Special on KylieCosmetics.com and look what we just added to the site! Some limited edition glosses are making a comeback 😍 #Poppin #Jolly #Naughty #Cupid @kyliecosmetics</p> <p>A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Oct 18, 2017 at 9:43am PDT</p>   <p></p>     <p>Let’s be real, Kylie Jenner did not sprout a big set of lips overnight. We have all seen that meme in which she was fawning over Kris’s failed lip injections, which clearly gave her inspiration. Kylie kept on denying her lip fillers at every social event or even the trillions of fans that kept tweeting at her, shocked at her for getting lip fillers at the age of 16. Could you blame her though? The teen always under the scrutiny of the Camera, always being in the limelight of her sisters must have developed a lot of insecurities on her way to success, but did she really think living under the flashing lights was going to help her keep her lip injections in the dark?</p>   <i></i>
