         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -5<img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-715.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Humans are beautiful creatures who can do brilliant things; everyone has their unique traits. Regardless of how unique we are, there are certain things almost everyone can do with their body. But there are also some skills that can be done by only one in a million. Those things may seem easy but are almost impossible when you do them. Here are 19 things that 99% of people are unable to do, but that tiny 1% have no problem doing them.</p> <h2>18. Eyebrow Raise</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-716.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>When it is about communicating with other people you have some tools at your disposal, you can change your voice, use hand gestures or display all sorts of body language to help get your point across but while communicating one of the biggest cues comes from our face. Our facial expressions have the ability to say a lot about us; we can show people how we feel simply by adjusting parts of our face, like our eyebrows. You raise your eyebrows when you’re surprised and furrow them when you’re upset, but only a few can raise just one of their eyebrows independently. Most people can’t move just one eyebrow without affecting the other too. If you can’t do it no worries, it’s only normal, and you can always train your facial muscles and get good at it.</p> <h2>17. Lifting the Ring Finger</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-717.jpeg"/>Neatorama.com <p>Bend your middle finger and lay your hand palm down on the surface, try lifting your thumb, pinky and index finger one by one, easy right? Now try and lift your ring finger the same way. Surprised you can’t do it? Not to worry because it is not as easy as it may seem. The scientific reason why you can’t move your ring finger with your middle finger reserved is that the same tendon connects those fingers. You can’t move one individually without moving the other. Though this may seem difficult you would be happy to hear that you can train your ring finger so it can move independently, just needs some focus and a bit of exercise to do it.</p> <h2>16. Chair Lift</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-718.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>In a world of possible and impossible things, you would be astonished to find out a simple task that is beyond difficult for some people to do. Most men flawlessly fail at this task, but women tend to do it easily like it’s a walk in the park. Stand in front of a wall and take approximately three step backward from it and then place a chair between yourself and the wall. Now bend downwards from the waist and make a 90 degrees angle, then try picking up that chair and stand in a straight posture. If you keep your legs straight and don’t rock on your heels then pretty much every guy that tries this fails, but women do it effortlessly. The reason is that women have a lower center of gravity than men, so they have a better balance while lifting the chair.</p> <h2>15. Stretch your skin thin</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-719.jpeg"/>Piotr Dołżonek Via Wikipedia <p>If you’re like most normal people, you can’t stretch your skin much at all, but there are a few people born with the really stretchy skin through a condition called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. This syndrome affects the connected tissue on the skin and organs. These people can stretch their skins in different angles and to different lengths that most of us can never even imagine. People with stretchy skins easily gain fame too, and there is specifically a world record category for people with the stretchy skins. I know some of us do not want abilities like this, but it is still a unique ability nevertheless and something that only a few can do.</p> <h2>14. Holding Breath</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-720.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>There have been a lot of situations that we’ve challenged ourselves or had a competition with our friends on holding our breath and who holds their breath the longest. We may have realized that the vast majority of us are unable to hold our breaths for a long time until we passed out. Our body doesn’t allow us to go without air voluntarily, so the survival instincts kick in, and we let go and take deep breaths again. There are still some people who have trained their bodies through exercise, and deep meditation like divers, monks and magicians and that is the reason that they can hold their breaths for long periods of time unlike us.</p> <h2>13. Balancing Act</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-721.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>When have we not tried to balance stuff? From balancing simple things such as books to incredibly complicated things like our life. When it comes to balancing our sensory systems, work with parts of our body, so we stay upright. Balancing a book on your palm or standing on one leg may be easy but there is a next level of balancing stuff that only a few can do. From tightrope walkers to people with incredible talent of balancing huge rocks on little stones, these are things that seem way out of our normal scope. Although training might improve your balancing skills, some things are just way out of reach.</p> <h2>12. Multitasking</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-722.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Our brains can handle all sorts of tasks in the background without us even consciously knowing about them. It includes simple things like talking or even breathing. This is a type of multitasking, but there are also limits to the capacity of multitasking. Doing more than two things at a time may seem impossible sometimes, imagine listening to someone on the phone, running in the park and reading the park rules at the same time, we often just get two done properly. Some specific people can train their brains to multitask, but they are very rare.</p> <h2>11. Rotate 180</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-723.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Ever tried turning your head around to the full extent of a 180 degrees angle, so that your face looks like its front is on your back rather than on your chest? If not then you can certainly sit comfortably with people in public without scaring the soul out of them. We have seen scenes like this in horror movies mostly when an evil spirit possesses the body of someone, and their head turns around completely. You might be surprised to find out that there are people in real life that can do this, it may seem really painful to watch and hard to believe, but they pull off stunts like this for fun.</p>     <h2>10. Talking while inhaling</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-724.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>This one is much difficult to do than it seems, you may not be able to speak correctly and only manage to say some words. Naturally, we exhale while talking, that’s how the vocal cords get their energy to make a sound. This all has to do with how our vocal cords are set up inside which can be affected by air and pressure. So almost no one can speak while inhaling except a few people like musicians inhale through their nose and breathe out through their mouths by circular breathing.</p> <h2>9. Opposite Direction</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-725.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Moving different body parts in opposite directions is one of the simplest and hardest things to do at the same time. Try moving your right hand in a clockwise direction and your left hand in an anticlockwise direction. You might be thinking this is easy stuff, here let me do it but as soon as you try it you will realize how wrong you were. This happens because one side of the brain gets confused by the other, it cannot process these things at once that easily. As this is not a unique ability, you can perfect this technique by putting in some work and training your brain to process both at once. Some people even can write from both their hands at once, the left hand and the right hand work simultaneously without any pause.</p> <h2>8. Wiggle Ears</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-727.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>We have at least tried for once in our life to wiggle our ears, and most of us may have failed miserably in doing so. If you haven’t done it yet, try doing it now to find out. Although it is very difficult you may be glad to find out that it does not depend on genetics, some people pull it off who have no parents that can do it. You may practice a lot to get to wiggle your ears, but most of those who have tried it still couldn’t manage to do it. So I guess if you can’t-do it, scratch it off your list and find something else that you can do that only a few can.</p> <h2>7. Fist in Mouth</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-729.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>You’ve likely met someone with the most strangest and bizarre talents of putting their fists in their mouth completely. You may be disgusted and in awe at the same time seeing that especially when you realize that you can’t-do it yourself. Although it may seem pretty special, it is not a very difficult thing to do but mostly about the parts of your body. If you have a big mouth and small hands, you will have no problem in doing that but if your hands are too big for your mouth that is an impossible case altogether. So if you can’t put your fist in your mouth, don’t be sad, you just weren’t born to do silly things like this.</p> <h2>6. Gleeking Spit</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-731.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Gleeking is one of those rare and repulsive abilities that make you wonder why someone took the time to master that skill. It is pretty much spitting, but also more like shooting saliva from your mouth in a single stream. It may happen in our sleep or when we yawn but not for certain. Only a few people can pull this off because it takes a certain amount of tongue dexterity to get it right. So my advice to you is to go and practice something better than getting your Gleeking skills on point. Do a favor for yourself and others around you.</p> <h2>5. The Bird Dog</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-733.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If you’re a consistent yogi, then you will already be aware of what a bird dog is. It is a pretty standard exercise in which you get on the knees and put your hands on the floor; then you extend one arm and one leg which are on opposite sides, pretty standard stuff. The real problem arises when you extend one arm and leg from the same side, for example, your right arm and leg. There is a big balancing problem as your body starts rocking, you can stay in that posture by putting all your weight on one side, but all this is easier said than done. Give it a go, find out if you can do it.</p> <h2>4. Eye Popping</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-735.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>One of the most freaky and weird things to do, not sure I would call it a talent but certainly a unique thing to do which I guarantee you that not a lot of people in this world that are capable of doing. It is a condition known as floppy eyelid syndrome in which people can pop out there eye a bit from their socket. I’m sure that you won’t even think about doing it just by imagining it. The people that can do this get famous pretty easily as this too has a world record category. Doctors mostly advise against it as it can be quite painful and might damage the eyes when repeatedly done.</p> <h2>3. Sneezing Eyes</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-737.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Everyone sneezes, it is a natural reaction of our body. Some may sneeze because of the dust, pollen or just the common cold or flu. The thing that we notice is that when people sneeze they always close their eyes involuntarily. Now there are myths that you can’t sneeze with your eyes open and that even if you do your eyes will pop out of your socket. These all have been proved wrong recently, in fact, sneezing with your eyes open is also a unique ability that only a few can do by training their eyes.</p> <h2>2. Running Limitless</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-739.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Running is one of the best exercises possible, everyone runs, it is great for health and maintaining a good physique. Running long distances requires a lot of dedication and training compare to short distance runs. But even though you may prepare a lot for a long distance and might do pretty good there are still limits to what a normal body can endure. After some time your body fills up with lactic acid, and you get cramped up and tired. There are some with a unique ability of flushing out lactic acid from their bodies meaning they run endlessly without the body tiring or getting cramps.</p> <h2>1. Chin Tongue</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-741.jpeg"/>Shutterstock     <p>How long is your tongue? Ever tried stretching it downwards to see how far it goes? If you have a short tongue, then you shouldn’t even bother to try touching it below your chin but if you can do it congratulations because you might be the 1% of people who can actually pull this off. Although it just depends on the length of your tongue, it is still a unique ability that only a few can do and hence deserving to come on this list.</p>   <i></i>
