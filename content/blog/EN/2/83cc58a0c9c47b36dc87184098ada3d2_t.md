         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 17<p>Â </p> <p>It is not other worldly to believe that a very large number of people believe that the dates you are born in have a certain impact on your outlook on life. Ranging from your personality to your habits and even your preferences in the bedroom, your birth month may actually reveal your secret fetishes. It is not wrong to be all vanilla but the following zodiac signs have the most titillating sense of love-making.</p> <h2>8. Aries</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1374.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>This is one of the fire signs of zodiac with an attitude of getting down there and then if it feels right. They will not go for variation or lengthy preparations to set the mood they will rather just zero in on the fun. Even if it involves a risk of indecent exposure like doing it on the hood of the car or in the hallway or the garage, Aries are game. Being headstrong they want their love-making to be vigorous and they want it there and then.</p> <h2>7. Taurus</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1375.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The most sensual out of all the zodiac signs they live for pleasurable stimulation. They might not be too active physically if their partner is pleasing them just fine. They like to employ all senses when going down on their lover particularly the sense of taste.</p> <p>Since they are renowned for their foreplay you might expect sex incorporated with some food items like a ripe mango in the showers is not too surprising.</p> <h2>6. Gemini</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1376.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>They are easily bored by repetitive pattern and want something new. They are fearless explorers who live with the conviction that you need to try out different things and be open to different ways of stimulation. So their real fetish is basically different ways to experience the pleasures of sex. Rest assured, if you have a Gemini partner you will always be facing some new adventure between the sheets.</p> <h2>5. Cancer</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1377.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>This zodiac sign is often associated with emotions and not really too much into expressing their deepest darkest desires since they are protective of them in public eye. However this emotionality once settles down and they finally open up to a person completely the resulting romance is very intense.</p> <p>Cancer are known for liking to be spanked or canning. Anal sex is also a very strong possibility with them as they have some special inclination towards making love with the bum.</p>     <h2>4. Leo</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1378.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Leo is often a lover in a traditional sense but there is a kinkier side to them as well. Being proud and having a need to be praised, they have this urge of exhibiting their love to even the whole wide world.</p> <p>Just give them enough admiration and they will be unraveling their wildest fantasies to you in a matter of seconds. This exhibitionism is what enables them to even broadcast their love to the entire world without a care.</p> <h2>3. Virgo</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1379.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>They might seek perfection in everything around them but as soon as the topic of sex comes they have this fence around their ideals. They will only reveal it when they are finally breached by the overflowing emotions in the bedroom and then they unleash their kinky side. They love to be spanked and is a sure turn on for them.</p> <h2>2. Libra</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1380.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The Goddess of love just like Taurus, they thrive with physical stimulation but there is a difference: they have way more stronger imagination. Their ideals dictate their sex life and they would rather visualize the experience than be physical involved in one.</p> <p>That does not mean they are not open to making love, only that they want to first imagine a perfect layout and what kind of lingerie and atmosphere should be there. The kink with them involves them observing the act even if their lover is making love to them. They like to just sit back and relax and observe.</p> <h2>1. Scorpio</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1382.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>They might appear to be the most mysterious of all the zodiac sign as far as their sexual fantasies are concerned but infact they are the most easiest to predict. This is because Scorpio is always open to any form of forming that intense connection out of some really twisted sexual arousal.</p>     <p>They will go to any lengths to please themselves and their partners whether it involves bondage, whips or dungeons. They will leave no stone unturned to explore the different hotspots on your body or even in your mind to get that maximum pleasure.</p>   <i></i>
