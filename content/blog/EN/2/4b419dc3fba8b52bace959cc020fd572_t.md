         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 2<p> </p> <p> </p> <h2>29. Linguini from Ratatouille</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2199.jpeg"/>tripletsandus <p>Responsible for invoking a love for ratatouille in kids (and adults), this was a fun movie which played with our emotions as well. We adored Linguini and Remy and it is no surprise that this dad and his little one dressed up as everyone’s favorite Chef Linguini and Masterchef Remy!</p> <h2>28. Scar from The Lion King</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2200.jpeg"/>wikiepedia <p>‘Ugh!’ is the first expression and emotion which comes to mind at the mention of Scar’s name. As much as we all hate him, we also equally love Khal Drogo, our sun and our stars (swoons) from the <em>Game of Thrones</em>. Hate them or love them, you can’t deny the remarkable resemblance between the two.</p> <h2>27. The grandpa from Up</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2201.jpeg"/>imgur <p>Oh my poor heart! I believe I cried harder in the first ten minutes of Up than I have cried my entire life. What would you do if you spotted your favorite oldie in your neighborhood? I know I’d hide under his porch and secretly wait for his house to take flight and tag along.</p> <h2>26. The kid from Up</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2202.jpeg"/>via izismile <p>How adorable is Russell and what uncanny resemblance we have here! If I had a kid who even remotely looked like my favorite kid from Up, I’d dress him up as Russell every Halloween.</p> <h2>25. Flash from Zootopia</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2203.jpeg"/>via izismile <p>Flash, Flash hundred yard dash. SPOILER ALERT! The end of Zootopia had me cackling so hard when Flash turns out to be the over-speeding manic harassing the streets of Zootopia. Who would have thought! I hope this girl appreciates what a beloved character she resembles.</p> <h2>24. Grandmother from Tweety</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2204.jpeg"/>via izismile <p>Our favorite granny, hands down. And look at her doppleganger. Same pristine, neatly tucked in hair, same glasses, same granny love shining through down to the very same wrinkle. Are our favorite characters coming to life and we haven’t caught up with it yet?</p> <h2>23. Boss Baby</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2206.jpeg"/>via instagram <p>Okay, stop it! This is too much and it is too freaking adorable. Started out as the baby from hell, boss baby quickly made a place in his brother’s heart as well as ours. I cannot even begin to take an estimate of how many infants are going to be dressed as this adorable little guy this Halloween.</p> <h2>22. Toothless from How to Train your dragon</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2205.jpeg"/>via izismile <p>Because I couldn’t possibly get a dragon, when this movie first came out I changed my cat’s name from Kristine to Toothless. She has a full set of very sharp teeth and is a Siamese. She looks nothing like the original Toothless but I didn’t care. However, this cat does and I am sure the owner must be super proud!</p> <h2>21. Gru from Despicable me</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2207.jpeg"/>via izismile <p>The best nice guy villain in the entire world, Gru looks like nails but is made of marshmallow fluff. I wonder if the guy on the left is anything like Gru and if he is then I am gonna follow him home to his secret lab and beg him to adopt me too!</p> <h2>20. Johnny Bravo</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2208.jpeg"/>via izismile <p>‘Hey sexy mamma!’ has got to be one of the most used pickup lines to date all thanks to kids of my generation hearing this every day on their CN. I really hope this guy’s girlfriend keeps an eye out for the kind of shenanigans he <em>might </em>be up to if he resembles the actual Johnny Bravo in more than just one way.</p> <h2>19. Elsa from Frozen</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2209.jpeg"/>via instagram <p>Frozen sent the world into a frenzy which it still has not recovered from. The movie came out in 2013 and since then, more than half the world’s population has gone Halloween-ing dressed as their favorite queen. All hail Elsa and the phenomenon she is!</p> <h2>18. Belle from Beauty and the Beast</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2210.jpeg"/>via wikiepedia <p>Belle teaches us that heroines don’t just look pretty, they are smart as anything as well. She’s your bookish, girl next door with a kind heart and loving soul. Her doppelganger looks almost as magical and amazing as her. I want to get them both in a room and have them discuss my favorite book.</p> <h2>17. Boo from Monster Inc.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2211.jpeg"/>via instagram <p>If I ever have a daughter, I want it to be this little gorgeous girl from Monster Inc. How adorable is the real-life Boo above. I wonder if she has Sully hiding in her closet and if they both go on monster mission every night. Can we tag along?</p> <h2>16. Ned Flanders from The Simpsons</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2212.jpeg"/>via imgur <p>An upright, righteous and articulate guy from Springfield, Ned is the butt of almost every joke by Homer Simpson. We still love him though and his Flanders-y ways. Keep rocking cartoon Ned and real life Ned!</p>     <h2>15. Tarzan</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2213.jpeg"/>via imgur <p>Weird Al and Tarzan! Two different and equally awesome people who just <em>happen</em> to look like each other as well? <em>Whaaat!</em></p> <h2>14. Jessie from The Toy Story</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2214.jpeg"/>via tumblr <p>Another major Halloween inspired look comes from our favorite cowgirl from The Toy Story. Even yours truly went as Jessie on two Halloweens (once in college) and I believe I still have the costume hung in the back of the closet somewhere for any future use.</p> <h2>13. Trixie from Lady and the Tramp</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2215.jpeg"/>via tumblr <p>Goldie Hawn is Lady reincarnated and we would love to see a live action rendition of Lady and the Tramp featuring Goldie Hawn.</p> <h2>12. Denise the Muppet</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2216.jpeg"/>via imgur <p>Another uncanny resemblance, Denise the Muppet. This makes me wonder if there is an doppelganger factory someplace where these real life people are made using these puppets and animated characters as an inspiration.</p> <h2>11. Prince Eric from The Little Mermaid</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2217.jpeg"/>via wikia <p>My McDreamy! A prince so handsome that he was love at first sight for our favorite red headed mermaid, Ariel. So much so, that she gave up everything she had ever known and even her own voice in exchange for a chance to get to know him. They eventually fell in love. Fairy tale love goals!</p> <h2>10. Prince Adam from Beauty and the Beast</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2218.jpeg"/>via imgur <p>I’m convinced that this guy goes to every cosplay, every costume party and Halloween party dressed as Prince Adam from Beauty and the Beast because he is meant for it! Although he is a beast for a major part of the movie, the few glimpses we have of the actual Prince towards the end are more than enough to reduce us to a melting puddle of <em>habba habba habba</em>.</p> <h2>9. Aladdin</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2219.jpeg"/>via imgur <p>Arabian nights, Like Arabian days, More often than not, Are hotter than hot, in a lot of good ways… Mmm, and I can imagine at least one solid, good way as to why: Aladdin! Everyone’s beloved thief (he was good guy at heart, ok!) and future King, all Hail Aladdin and his gorgeous doppelganger.</p> <h2>8. Mario</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2220.jpeg"/>via imgur <p>Take it from someone who grew up playing Mario, we have a curious case of I-am-seeing-doubles here.</p> <h2>7. Mr. Burns from The Simpsons</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2221.jpeg"/>via imgur <p>Probably one of the most hated characters on the show (and on TV), Mr. Burns has a real life look-alike. I hope that the only things that they have in common are those balding heads, the sneaky smile and a cunning look.</p> <h2>6. Mrs. Potato Head</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2222.jpeg"/>via imgur <p>Who knew that there is a doppelganger for almost everything in this world?</p> <h2>5. Peter Griffin from Family Guy</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2223.jpeg"/>via Wikimedia <p>And here we have Peter Griffin reincarnated! The dad of the family, Peter has a habit of proving his masculinity every now and then. He also takes competing over the most trivial and petty things with his wife, Lois, most seriously. We hope you behave yourself, real life Peter Griffin.</p> <h2>4. Jessica Rabbit</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2224.jpeg"/>via wikipedia <p>“I’m not bad. I’m just drawn that way,” is one of Jessica Rabbit’s most popular movie lines. A character from <em>Who Censored Roger Rabbit? </em>Jessica is Roger’s human-toon wife. She is also probably the most well-known sex symbol in animation. We wonder if the real life Jessica Rabbit has something in common with the human-toon Jessica Rabbit.</p> <h2>3. Anna from Frozen</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2225.jpeg"/>via wikia <p>Elsa’s sister and another character who took the world by storm; Anna is fun-loving playful princess who loves her sister more than anything else in the world. If you were under a rock since 2013 and have not seen Frozen yet, SPOILER ALERT, it is the sisters’ undying love which saves Anna from being eternally frozen.</p> <h2>2. Rapunzel from Tangled</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2226.jpeg"/>via wikia <p>Rapunzel is a beautiful princess who has long magical hair who has been living a life of captivity in an isolated tower with a witch whom she thinks is her mother. She breaks free with the help of Flynn Rider and ends up reunited with her own parents, the King and the Queen. The real life Rapunzel bears an uncanny resemblance to the Rapunzel from Tangled.</p> <h2>1. Papa Smurf</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2227.jpeg"/>via imgur     <p>Blast from the past, I believe these were some of the first cartoons that my parents showed to me. Papa Smurf is the smartest and one of the oldest smurfs alive and is typically dressed in red pants and a matching red Phrygian cap. Which one is the real Papa Smurf, you ask? Take a wild guess!</p>   <i></i>
