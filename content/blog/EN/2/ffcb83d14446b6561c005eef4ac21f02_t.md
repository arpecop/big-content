Some say it is not being creative enough whilst Aristotle probably raises a challenging eye brow and asks for an explanation. These children who did copy their mother‚Äôs add their own spin to the copied version which could or could not be better than the original lay out. We have all used our mother‚Äôs as role models, used their clothes and wore their make up but that stage might have worn off a long time ago but not for these celebrity children. Read on to find out if these kids really did outshine their parents or not.</p> <h2>9. North West and Kim Kardashian West:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-534.jpeg"/>Vanity Fair <p>Though North has come forward with her own ideas as to how she should dress no one can deny that the child is without any doubt the off-spring of two of the biggest icons in the fashion industry. North has been known to twin not only with her mother but at times her father too although her mother‚Äôs influence on her has shown to be more dominant of the two. Parading the streets or events in the same outfit the family is picture perfect and just downright adorable.</p> <h2>8. Blue Ivy and Beyonc√©:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-535.jpeg"/>Etonline <p>We simply could not complete this list without mentioning Queen B. With Blue Ivy fulfilling the role of a Princess to the epitome of the word like Kim and North, Beyonce and Blue Ivy don‚Äôt disappoint. Although many people claim that the child is taking after her father Jay-Z in terms of looks the pictures of Blue Ivy and Beyonce streaming the internet say otherwise. Rocking similar floral dresses at their vacation in Paris Queen B and Blue Ivy take the stage with their adorableness. Mom and daughter goals? A big yes!</p> <h2>7. Kylie Jenner and Kris Jenner:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-536.jpeg"/>Teen Vogue <p>From the big lips down to wearing the same bikinis it is not hard to tell Kylie has been majorly inspired by her mother Kris Jenner. Kylie has been said to copy many people from her family. Ranging from her oldest sister Kim to her youngest sister Kendall but upon closer inspection one can tell that Kylie‚Äôs original style stems from her mother Kris‚Äôs, but with her own undeniable spin to it. Don‚Äôt you agree?</p> <h2>6. Lordes Leon and Madonna</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-537.jpeg"/>Etonline <p>The hair might make it impossible for these two to look like actual twins but their sense of style being akin to each other‚Äôs does not disappoint. Apart from having a similar structure Leon adopted her mother‚Äôs crazy style as well and is very close to stealing the uniqueness of it. Can you blame her?</p> <h2>5. Kaia Gerber and Cindy Crawford:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-538.jpeg"/>Yahoo <p>Cindy Crawford, an American model and actress is not only responsible for gracing the covers of many magazines but also responsible for producing one of the prettiest off-springs ever. We aren‚Äôt talking about her son but her daughter who is the spitting image of her mother in so many ways. The teen gives her mom a run for her money by copying the looks her mother rocked in the 90s and maybe pulling them off even better?</p>     <h2>4. Ivanka Trump and Ivana Trump:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-539.jpeg"/>People.com <p>This might come as a shock to most of you but Ivanka Trump hasn‚Äôt been imitating her father all these years, although that was sort of obvious because come on the hair! Ivanka the daughter of Ivana Trump, a former supermodel, has her mother‚Äôs beautiful hair and sense of style. Not is Ivanka supremely beautiful she is also adaptable to all the styles her mother had rocked during her prime. Guess we can all be glad which gene dominated hers better.</p> <h2>3. Rumer Willis and Demi Moore:</h2>      <p> That moment when you realize you actually are becoming your mother #twinning #imnotmad</p> <p>A post shared by Rumer Willis (@rumerwillis) on May 25, 2015 at 6:08pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Demi Moore. A name that makes us all sigh. Rumer Willis on the other hand is giving her mother a run for her money. Not only will their instagram‚Äôs make you think that both of them could be long lost twins but their ability to cater to the same outfits and look just as good makes everyone gush with envy and look on with appreciation. Willis has adopted not only her mother‚Äôs grace and beauty but her sense of style as well.</p> <h2>2. Zoe Kravitz and Lisa Bonet:</h2>  <p>üíó Zo√´ Kravitz attends Valentino Haute Couture F/W 2016-2017 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on July 6, 2016 pic.twitter.com/49hZlW0qNE</p> <p>‚Äî NANA JIBRIL üåôüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà (@girlswithtoys) July 9, 2016</p> <p></p> <p>Who doesn‚Äôt know about ‚ÄòThe Cosby Show‚Äô? The star Lisa Bonet with her dreads not to mention her contradictory sophisticated hobo style could easily switch her role with her daughter Zoe given how not only their hair or face but their sense of style is so alike as well. Once Bonet confessed to selling her clothes to the thrift store which in turn got an even more shocking confession out of her daughter. Zoe bought all the clothes her mother sold to the thrift shop. Bet you never thought about this particular way of getting your hands on your mother‚Äôs clothes.</p> <h2>1. Billie Lourd and Carrie Fisher:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-540.jpeg"/>Yahoo     <p>The now late Carrie Fisher also known as Princess Leia left behind a legacy in the form of her daughter Billie Lourd. And man she did not disappoint. We can all say that not only do these two look startlingly alike but Billie has not made it easy for the crowd by copying her mother‚Äôs style especially to pay tribute to the actress at ‚ÄòStar War‚Äô events knowing how much it meant to her mother. Safe to say none of us were left with dry eyes. Billie, a star in ‚ÄòScream Queens‚Äô caught the attention of many when she wore huge ear muffs in a subtle but out there imitation of her mother‚Äôs look from Star Wars. Isn‚Äôt that adorable? We think so too.</p>   <i></i>
