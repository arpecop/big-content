Love can change anything, just watch this little girl sing a lullaby to her newly rescued puppy. Your heart will melt from all the cuteness!</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-23.jpeg"/>dailymail.co.uk <p>As an animal lover myself I always urge people to adopt rather than shop for a puppy when they’re looking into getting a new pet. But, for some seeing truly is believing.</p>     <p>Oakley was recently adopted from the American Lab Rescue by Lauren Malone and her family. Having two kids at home some might question the mom as to why she would ever adopt a dog that’s been rescued off the streets. But, Lauren didn’t care and adopted the puppy knowing that it would do more good than harm rather she didn’t see any harm that sweet-face dog could do. While Oakley lays cozied up in her arms</p> <h2>Puppy love</h2> <p>Just like that, the family fell in love with the puppy. The mom even posted a video of her daughter Katie singing a lullaby to her new ridiculously cute puppy. Katie even captioned the video as, “and this is why you should adopt a rescue dog, or two, or three, or four. We adopted Oakley this week from our favorite rescue Americanlabrescue.com.”</p> <p>Katie sings,“Lullaby, sweetie pie, I love you so-ooo much,” while Oakley lays cozied up in her arms.</p> <p>You think that’s cute? Wait until the end when the little puppy nuzzles deeper into Katie’s arms and rests his head right under her chin.</p> <p>Katie turns to her mom and asks,” wasn’t that a good lullaby?”</p> <p>Her mom looks at her and says,” it really was. Want to sing another lullaby?”</p> <p>Katie thinks it’s a great idea and sings another lullaby to Oakley who is so filled with love, that he falls asleep instantly. Just like all puppies, Oakley can fall asleep anywhere, anytime whether it’s cuddling up with Katie or next to his big sis, Mae June, who seems to love him just as much as everyone else.</p> <h2>Adoption is better than buying</h2>     <p>You can’t buy love, but you can adopt it. All dogs need a safe and loving home to live in, not to mention it’s much cheaper. Taking a dog off the streets into your home is the biggest blessing for that little puppy. So, why not take a trip to your local shelter to find the perfect dog that fits your personality and you’ll be surprised to know that most shelters often off free vaccinations, microchipping, neutering in their fee! What a great deal, you won’t get that at a pet store.</p>   <i></i>
