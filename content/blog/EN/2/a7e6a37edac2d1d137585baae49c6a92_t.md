If you don’t want to end up repelling him from the relationship avoid the following things according to their zodiac sign.</p> <h2>12. Aries</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-712.jpeg"/> Tapoos <p>It is not a good idea to escalate a simple argument into a full blown fight with him. They are headstrong and will not yield anyways. However they will grow weary of you standing up to them. They have naturally short tempers and are like a time bomb about to go off if provoked beyond a certain limit.</p> <p>It is better to avoid confrontation especially elongating it.</p> <h2>11. Taurus</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-713.jpeg"/> Tapoos <p>They have a very possessive nature and are not at all open to the idea of sharing unless they grow comfortable enough to offer. If you are in a relationship with a Taurus guy and just find it innocent enough to take something f theirs without permission you might have another thought coming soon.</p> <p>It could be their personal things, their friends or even food. Just give him time and he will eventually offer you himself.</p> <h2>10. Gemini</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-714.jpeg"/> Tapoos <p>They love to communicate their heart out to their significant other and want their audience to be equally engaged with what they have to say. If they get a hint that you are not even a slight bit interested they might get hurt.</p> <p>So just being a good listener is the one thing they will love you for the most. If you interrupt their musings or long drawn recollection of the day’s events they might feel offended.</p> <h2>9. Cancer</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-715.jpeg"/> Tapoos <p>The most emotional of the zodiac signs if they feel you are being mean to them will make them hate your gut. Men under this sun sign are deeply intuitive and very sensitive to even slightest bit of criticism.</p> <p>It will not do you any good if you compare them with others because they are highly sincere and will be shattered followed by rage if you did. You may think this is not manly but that is how vulnerable they are with only their significant other.</p> <p>Their shell may hold off other people’s criticism but if their own beloved does that will not be tolerated at all.</p> <h2>8. Leo</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-716.jpeg"/> Tapoos <p>Naturally boastful and little stamina for being not in charge of the situation, it is natural to assume they will hate the fact if you tried to influence them in any way.</p> <p>They might give hints or subtle ways to incorporate their need to be in the lime light and if they felt overshadowed by their partner will just not sit well with them.</p>     <h2>7. Virgo</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-717.jpeg"/> Tapoos <p>They are very argumentative and will not yield to whatever logical reasoning you come up with.</p> <p>They hate to admit that they are in the wrong and will try to make you see things from their perspective. For both of your sakes, just accept their point of view or else you will have a headache to deal with too later on.</p> <h2>6. Scorpio</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-718.jpeg"/> Tapoos <p>They have a very acute sense of things especially when they are being lied to. They almost always will call out your bluff and it also makes them super mad if their partner did that to them. It is better to just tell them the truth rather than them finding it out eventually because they will.</p> <h2>5. Libra</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-719.jpeg"/> Tapoos <p>Men under this sun sign hate to be given the duty to choose between different available options. They like to stay diplomatic and neutral so it makes them uncomfortable when approached with the subject of picking out a favorite.</p> <p>Just do not put them in that situation or you might find yourself being hated by him more and more.</p> <h2>4. Sagittarius</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-720.jpeg"/> Tapoos <p>The wild and free spirited Sagittarius like to do things at their own pace. They thrive well if they are given their freedom and space because after all they are the most spontaneous of the Zodiac signs. If you will try to tie them down with schedules or duties or making them do things your way will make them ultra-displeased. So do voice your opinion but don’t enforce it at all.</p> <h2>3. Capricorn</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-721.jpeg"/> Tapoos <p>Just be your own self and don’t put up an act in front of them. They usually see through all the façade and absolutely hate artificial personalities. You will lose their respect if you faked your appearance or personality in front of him. They appreciate for what the other person truly is and abhor duplicity.</p> <h2>2. Aquarius</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-722.jpeg"/> Tapoos <p>Never try to make them see the things your way. Just don’t try to change them at all because they have their own certain ideals and if he feel pressurized to make his decisions will eventually drive him away.</p> <h2>1. Pisces</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-723.jpeg"/> Tapoos     <p>They are the reflecting, serious brooding types who don’t have too much of a funny bone. So make sure they have some sense of humor before playing a prank on them or else they might not entirely feel welcoming of the idea.</p>   <i></i>
