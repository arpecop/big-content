         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -7<p>Most of us have grown up watching Disney channel and our favorite Disney stars. You know the worst part of being a Disney child star? There comes a moment in their lives that they become total train wrecks. Maybe for a short while and they might recover but still that phase does come.</p> <p>Here’s a list of 20 Disney child stars, gathered by <strong>Tapoos</strong>, who have definitely changed a lot after leaving Disney.</p> <h2>Ross Lynch</h2>      <p> &quot;Lets grow old together&quot; – Here Comes Forever by R5</p> <p>A post shared by Ꭱoss Lynch (@rossr5) on Mar 24, 2013 at 7:10pm PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> You guys!

He immediately became our favorite but when his Disney days finished, he started to take some adult roles in darker movies. He’s kinda freaking fan girls now instead of thrilling them.</p> <h2>Zendaya</h2>      <p> guess who's your new XOUT girl!??!??! @xout</p> <p>A post shared by Zendaya (@zendaya) on Feb 3, 2014 at 8:12am PST</p>   <p></p>      <p> @wonderlandmag cover😍 (I see what y'all saying by the hand placement lmao but that was not intentional you little pervs😂😂😂)</p> <p>A post shared by Zendaya (@zendaya) on May 25, 2016 at 12:11pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Zendaya played Rocky Blue in “Shake it up”, a Disney Channel show.
