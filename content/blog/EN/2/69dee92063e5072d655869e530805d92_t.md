Do your hopes for staying together, like that old couple sitting at the next table, look just like a dream that can’t come true anymore but you just can’t figure out, WHERE DID IT ALL GO WRONG?</p> <p>This could happen sometimes when you can’t see the wrong with yourself. We have compiled a few of such reasons that will give you an insight of what could you possibly be doing wrong that is annoying your mate too and the things you should be careful of doing if you want a long healthy relationship with your significant other.</p> <h3>10. Mind the Tone.</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-88.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>The most uncomfortable situation among two people living together is when it comes to an argument. As you can’t just ignore it, so be ready to face it. Now a lot of people do not have any control over their tone.</p> <p>They, when faced with arguments, have a natural way of talking loud. This habit can be disastrous to a relationship because sometimes a loud tone can annoy the partner really bad and can turn a simple argument into a fight.</p> <p>Just keep in mind that in such situations a high tone will only make it worse and can make you regretful later, however, a good defence mechanism with valid points in a moderate tone can not just help you win the argument but can also save you from washing dishes again when you already have done them a day before it.</p> <h3>9. Don’t Let Your Insecurities Get You.</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-89.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Jealousy is just like a parasite of a relationship and it eats up the love to the point someone gets badly hurt. There is no such thing as good jealousy or bad jealousy. If you are jealous it’s simply your insecurity taking over you. The key to a healthy relationship is Trust and if you can’t trust your partner then eventually you will lose them.</p> <p>Most of the time it is observed that the jealous person in a relationship tends to be the one capable of cheating, as for them the possibility of their partner cheating them is highly likely than their own. So if you don’t want to put your relationship at risk, stop over thinking about your partner being involved with others and stop keeping an eye on others too.</p> <h3>8. Take Care Of Your Mate’s Nose.</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-90.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>It might not seem like a big issue but dirty or stinky socks can sometimes be a huge deal breaker too. It’s not just about socks, in a relationship, the deal is to show how much you care about your partner whether it is something big like remembering the anniversary date, or it is small like leaving the stinking socks out of your bed so your mate doesn’t die the most horrible death by smelling your stinking feet.</p> <p>As mentioned before, it might not seem big but gosh some people’s feet smell like garbage bags and breaking over it seems perfectly logical to many sane people. So be careful about what you want your partners to smell, your feet or refreshing flower smell of your soap.</p> <h3>7. Sleep In your Birth Suit.</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-91.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>Why sleep with boundaries when you can have all the free space you need. Sleeping without clothes is proved to release stress, and that when done with your partner, adds to it. Having slept like this with your partner will give both the most relaxing sleep and a strong bond of love. The more you show how comfortable you are with your partner the bond of love will grow stronger and no passage of time will be able to break it.</p> <h3>6. Clean up Your Own Mess.</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-92.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>If you want a healthy relationship, make yourself environment-friendly because there is a direct relation of a mess to your relationship.</p>     <p>Nobody likes to clean things up but nobody likes things to be dirty either. Cleaning something right after making it dirty shows a sense of responsibility and who doesn’t like someone who is responsible.</p> <p>A relationship cannot last long unless there is a mutual cooperation from both partners. The burden of making the things clean cannot be borne by one person and shouldn’t even be.</p> <h3>5. Try to Understand.</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-93.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Women, when at their climacteric get hot flashes. Sweating and having warm skin is the most common behavior. They, being in such an uncomfortable state, look for all the support from their better halves, so no matter how awkward or insane it looks what they want, men must do anything for them that makes them feel better.</p> <p>Sometimes it can really become too much for men to bear but they should try and understand what the women are going through and they should get along it even when it is too cold for them to sit with open windows in chilling winter, as, this is the point where the actual love is put to test and this is the point which decides that to what extremes they can be with each other.</p> <h3>4. Turn Up the Volume.</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-94.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>After being in a relationship for too long it is normal for one to get tired of the arguments every other day, or fighting over, which show to watch or keep listening to, how bitchy your wife’s colleague is or how harsh your husband’s boss is. This is the point where you need some space.</p> <p>Headphones can really come in handy at such point because the best part of it is that you don’t have to listen or pretend to listen to anyone. PS you get to hear some cheerful voices with heart touching words and music rather than shrill voices with hurting words and tone of your flat heart rate going beep. So whenever you think, I can’t take it anymore, just grab a handsfree, it will give you immunity for some time and you will be able to make it a little further without going insane.</p> <h3>3. What Matters is What You Show.</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-95.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>The relationship is all about how good you can face the challenges together and how well you show your love to your partner, and if you are good at that then you nailed it. Most of the happy couples are living together for very long just because they know the tactics of selflessness.</p> <p>The more you show how much you care for your partner, even when you’re your interest is embedded in it, the more there are chances of survival of that couple. The best part is that both of them know the personal interests of others in a particular act of selflessness shown by them, still, they get along with it as the happiness comes from mutual understanding right?</p> <h3>2. Sharing is Caring</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-96.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Whether it is an angry exchange of texts, face to face argument or food at the table, never be the last one to make a move as it not only shows the selfishness but also it is rude.</p> <p>Say a person who saves the last bit of food for you this shows that person is unselfish and also shows that he/she not always wants the last word on things. Behaviour like that can bring about positive feelings for you as it shows how important the other person is, in their life.</p> <h3>1. Stay Positive and Stay Clear.</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-97.jpeg"/>Shutterstock     <p>A healthy relationship is that in which both partners are open to each other and they don’t hold back anything, the more you stay clear about things to your partner, the more they are likely to understand you and then reach to you without any complexities involved. And couples that stay together for long can even overcome the complexities. Also staying positive in your dealings with your partner is the most important thing in relationship as negativity can only hurt you.</p>   <i></i>
