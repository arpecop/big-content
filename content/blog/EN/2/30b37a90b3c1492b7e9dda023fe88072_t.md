However, it is absolutely possible for one to experience this feeling with their partner. Mostly, this sort of feeling is very much positive, and is also very rare.</p> <p>If you’re enjoying your relationship, you may want to see if you have the following signs in your connection. Of course, you can’t force chemistry, but you can gauge whether it is even possible in your current relationship. Read on below to find out whether you have these aspects in your romantic bonds or not:</p> <h2>9. Grinning Away</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-814.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>When you’re with someone you truly love, and the feeling is mutual, you’re both in a great place. You would then unconsciously be telling the world just how you feel through your smiles.</p> <p>Not only would you be smiling when you’re with your partner, but also likely be smiling throughout the day. You may find yourself wishing the bus driver a good morning with a grin. Even difficult coworkers or clients may get the benefit of those pearl whites flashed at them regularly.</p> <p>This is true even if one is generally a shy and withdrawn person. Being happy with someone can do wonders in drawing people out of their shell. It has nothing to do with changing who they are, but only make a positive difference in how they express themselves.</p> <h2>8. The Clicking</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-815.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Sometimes, when you meet that special someone, you just know you like them. You may start off as friends, then best friends, then something more.</p> <p>Even if you don’t really like someone when you first meet them, you may still feel like you know them. The feeling of animosity may very well become more positive once you realize it’s just a matter of being very similar.</p> <p>While instant chemistry doesn’t happen very often, it is still a very definite spark between two people. You may have felt this through a sense of relief when they walk into the room. You may always be on the lookout for them, because then you’d be sure of having good company. At the end of the day, the two of you just get one another. You always have and you hopefully always will.</p> <h2>7. Definite Physical Attraction</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-816.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Of course, one cannot deny the obvious importance of physical attraction. There does come a time when the love runs so deep that physical attributes just don’t matter anymore. And that’s a good thing.</p> <p>However, chemistry between two people does require some level of physical appeal. After all, most humans have sexual needs and their disposition towards what they find beautiful is only natural.</p> <p>However, this sort of fascination is probably the least useful sign of chemistry between partners. This is because attraction towards another person could happen at any time, regardless of how they look. Plus, finding someone beautiful on the outside is absolutely no indication of how beautiful the relationship would be. In fact, if the basis of the relationship is this sort of attraction, then it is more likely to be a shallow one.</p> <h2>6. A Spiritual Connection</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-817.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>There’s hitting it off with someone, and then there’s feeling like you know them from before. And by before, we mean way back. Perhaps even before you were born! If you don’t believe in such things, skip this point by all means. However, the spiritual realm just might be where you have met this person before.</p> <p>Sometimes, there’s just no denying that we feel a special connection to someone. This may have nothing to do with your friendship, or how the two of you share interests. It would have to do with how uplifted they make you feel just by being there with you.</p>     <h2>5. Laughing at the Same Things</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-818.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>When the two of you laugh, it’s usually of the same things. This is a very encouraging sign in a relationship. If you find yourself sharing YouTube videos that you both would find funny, consider yourself lucky. Having the ability to laugh at the same form of entertainment is very much likely to end in having great chemistry.</p> <p>If you have a similar sense of humor, you would also likely be able to connect and communicate better. This is highly important for those who are in a relationship since they have to figure out many things together. Connecting on every level may not be possible, but it is more likely if you’re helplessly laughing at inside jokes and memes.</p> <h2>4. Each Other’s Comfort Zone</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-819.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>When there is a spark between two people, they are likely to feel most comfortable with each other. There should be no sense of formality, especially when you’re alone together.</p> <p>You shouldn’t feel the need to always be dressed up when you meet. Your old pajamas could be just as attractive to them. Of course, there should be some effort put into one’s appearance for themselves. However, if you don’t feel like putting on makeup that day, you shouldn’t have to.</p> <p>Hence, having chemistry is directly related to having contentment. You would be able to find a lot of peace when you’re with this person, since you don’t have to put on a show. You can be yourself, and may even relax more when you’re with them.</p> <h2>3. Similar Cherishment</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-820.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Having similar interests is also a sign of good chemistry between two people. One cannot force themselves to like something they don’t. Hence, finding someone who has the same taste in movies, music, or books could be very rare. And let’s face it; chemistry may occur without this factor as well.</p> <p>However, once you find someone who enjoys something like you do, they might become a serious part of your life. This could make for an immensely fun time together. Sometimes, we have very obscure interest, and finding a partner who has the same kind could be very difficult. You may be surprised by the coincidence, but this might also be a definite sign that you two were meant to be.</p> <h2>2. Ease of Touch</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-821.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>If you successfully hit it off with someone, you would probably not flinch when they touch you. Being in a relationship involves a lot of casual touching. The two of you should hence feel free to touch the other playfully, comfortingly, and in several other ways.</p> <p>Of course, boundaries are extremely important in this area. Touching, however, is a measure of just how responsive the other person could be. So if you’re comfortable being touched on the arm or shoulder by them, and vice versa, good chemistry is on the horizon.</p> <h2>1. The Excitement Factor</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-822.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>If you have chemistry with someone, you may feel instantly excited when you see them. It could have been a rough day, but the minute the two of you meet and hug, all the tiredness seems to evaporate. This is quite a cheering sign in any sort of relationship.</p> <p>When your significant other is not around to energize you, you may feel rundown and depleted. This doesn’t mean you have a co-dependence disorder, but that you just miss the spark. You may then try to compensate for their absence by talking to them on the phone or through text. The minute they walk through that door, though, you would be active and on your feet in no time.</p> <p>This is a direct reversal of what happens in unhappy or abusive relationships. When an abusive partner walks in, the other person usually feels drained of all the energy they had. They may find it difficult to function and mess up their routine just because of the negative energy.</p>     <p>Consider yourself lucky if you have even a few of the above signs in your relationship. You’re probably having the time of yourself, so be sure to keep a positive and upbeat attitude! It’s always better to be grateful, especially when it comes to romance.</p>   <i></i>
