It is, often, known to be the worst experience someone has. It is cold blooded, it is cruel and it is insidious. It strikes suddenly and takes away every single piece we could offer. But it relieves too, the real pain and agony is offered by life. Life is something which we take for granted. It is an unparalleled experience unless it takes a U turn. Similar to death, it is insidious. It does not let you notice when it might take the turn but unlike death, it does not relieve. It offers pain after pain, it drains you but ceases at the point where you seem to be giving up. Then it makes a joke and start the process again, again and then again.</p> <p>Such a tragedy life struck upon a family living in Spain. One day little Abraham Moreno Edwards caught a cold. It seemed nothing serious, but an old common cold. But when her mother, Amanda, took her to the hospital she got quite a shock!. Abs’ doctor ( Abraham’s nickname ) advised them to do some blood tests. Tests revealed something very distressing to the family. Nine years old Abs was diagnosed with lymphoblastic leukaemia. Yes Leukaemia!! Leukaemia is a cancer of blood or bone marrow. This specific type of cancer makes body to produce abnormal amounts of blood cell, white cells in most of the cases. Cancer is always a distressing and sad news for anyone. It is not the disease itself that frightens the mortal but the follow up of methods to cure it . Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy is not that easy to suffer and in most of the cases, unfortunately, expenses are a worry as well. Immediately after the diagnosis, Abs’ chemotherapy was started. But the doctors noticed after a while that the little kid was not responding to the therapy. This led them to order some more tests. The test revealed something extraordinary yet again. It seemed that somehow the poor kid had myeloid leukaemia – a totally separate cancer. ( It was two weeks after the first diagnosis ).</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-726.jpeg"/>TheSun <p>“It’s pure chance that he has both – just bad luck,” commented Amanda.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-727.jpeg"/>swns <p>The poor mother had no idea that six weeks later she would, herself, be diagnosed with cancer. She noticed a lump on her breast and upon examination it was revealed that she had breast cancer. Soon she started having chemotherapy as well.</p>     <p>The family live in Salto del Negro near Vélez-Málaga, Spain, where Amanda worked as a translator for expats, until she became ill.</p> <p>Both her sons were born in Spain, and she is separated from their father José, 47, also Spanish.</p> <p>Despite having all sorts of trouble around them, the family is determined and bold enough to handle it well.</p> <h2>According to Amanda :</h2> <p>“I have chemo once in three weeks. He goes through five days consecutively, and any break he gets is spent in hospital with side effects. I feel like, in comparison, I’m not going through a lot. Abs knows that I know what he’s going through. We have been bonded by it. It is a special bond only me and him know. We are a team.</p> <p>We have a joke about both being bald and who looks best. We try to laugh to keep our spirits up. But in truth, it is very frightening. Our life is on hold and currently revolves around hospital appointments; we live from one to the next. But we just get on with it — we have to. What choice do we have?”</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-728.jpeg"/>swns <p>She further commented that it was frightening enough to watch him at the hospital, wondering what would happen to him, but then who know what God plans. She says that she considers herself to be at very ease when she compares herself to her son.</p> <p>“I have chemo once in three weeks. He goes through five days consecutively, and any break he gets is spent in hospital with side effects. ” Amanda said “I feel like in comparison I’m not going through a lot. They go through so much more and they do it with a smile on their faces, always happy. Abs knows that I know what he’s going through. We have been bonded by it. It is a special bond only me and him know. ”</p> <p>When asked what we she felt inside, she answered that before the incident she did not know how it was to cry without sobbing out loud. Now she knew it perfectly well.</p> <p>Abs is treated at Hospital Materno-Infantil in Malaga, and Amanda has her chemotherapy at a hospital in Vélez-Málaga, around half an hour away. With Amanda out of work due to her health, the family is struggling to pay for basics, such as gas to get them to and from appointments. Having worked in Spain since 2002 she gets free health treatment, but the country has little in the way of benefits payments, compared to the U.K. Her best friend Natalie Hancock, 50, is raising money to help them get by, with anything left over going towards a family Euro Disney trip, in years to come. She plans to donate 20 percent of anything raised to the volunteers at Abs’ oncology ward, who provide children with books and toys.</p>     <p>“When you go through things like this, you come to realize how much you rely on others,” Amanda said. “The kindness of people is amazing. We’re going to get through this eventually, it’s just a bit hard at the moment.”</p>   <i></i>
