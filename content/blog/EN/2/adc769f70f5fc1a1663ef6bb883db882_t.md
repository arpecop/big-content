It is a projection of individuality and often inspired by ideas that are very close to that person. However often times such ideas are so awe inspiring that they end up becoming a powerful fashion statement amongst the masses.</p> <p>It is understandable when a fan who looks up to a certain celebrity imitating their attire but it is a little unoriginal and in poor taste when another celebrity just plain copy the same style of another celeb.</p> <p>A little bit of imitation is fine but if you are completely carried away by the way another person carries themselves shows lack of creativity which is not a hallmark of a good artist. Following are few of the celebrities which have shown to be a little unoriginal and downright imitating other celebrities in their fashion statements.</p> <h2>6. Jeniffer Lopez imitates Ariana Grande</h2>      <p> @jlo sa dugim repom u novom spotu pjesme Amor, amor, amor 💕💞💞 ako i vi želite duži rep @hairdocroatia ima u ponudi repove dužine 57 cm i 45 cm u čak 9 nijansa 🔝💙</p> <p>A post shared by Hairdo Croatia (@hairdocroatia) on Nov 13, 2017 at 2:18am PST</p>   <p></p>      <p> #ariannagrande knows how to work a pony! Be more like her by going to PerkyPony.com! . . . #ariannagrandeponytail #ponytail #crimpedhair #longhair #redcarpetready #redcarpethair #perkypony</p> <p>A post shared by Perky Pony (@perky_pony) on Jan 8, 2017 at 9:00pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>It seems that the iconic hip hop star J-Lo is running out of creative self-expression by getting inspired so much with Ariana Grande’s hair style of a pony tail. The high pony tail and the old school take on outfits with high cropped miniskirts by Grande is considered to be the hip and happening style by Jennifer Lopez. Maybe it is what makes her look younger or trendier in her mind. Whatever the case maybe there is no denying the fact that she actually imitated a lot from Grande’s sense of dressing.</p> <h2>5. Hillary Duff inspired by Kylie Jenner</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-8-12-3316-02-jpg.jpeg"/>Wikipedia <p>The celebrated teenager star of reality TV is no longer drawing from her own creativity as she is inspired by Kylie Jenner in most of her styling techniques. From the way she dye and wear her hair to the way she shares her photos on instagram is heavily borrowed from the way Kylie does it. It is no surprise she has little originality when it comes to styling.</p> <h2>4. Kim borrows ideas from Beyoncé</h2>      <p> The Kueen! Bravo Kim 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 #kimkmetgala #metgala #kimkardashian #thekueen #kueenk</p> <p>A post shared by Brittany Geralds 💇❤️✌🏻️ (@brittanygeralds) on May 4, 2015 at 7:27pm PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> Beyoncé in a Sheer Stunner Gown at the Met Gala! Wow 😍 Best 🐝of the Best🐝… #beyoncemetgala #beyoncedress #queenbey #metgaladress</p> <p>A post shared by 👗GERONIMO VINTAGE👗 VTG Shop (@geronimovintage) on May 4, 2015 at 7:01pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Kim the celebrated reality TV star is never shy of blatantly taking up another celebrity’s ideas and flaunt it at major events. Nobody could mistake the attireshe wore to the Met Gala this year which was an almost exact replica of Beyoncé’s dress. Naturally Beyoncé reacted by flooding the star’s instagram account with bumblebees emoji explicitly suggesting of her copying her personal idea.</p>     <h2>3. Beyoncé and Kim imitating Jelena Karleusa</h2>      <p> 👻🙊❤ @karleusastar #jelenakarleusa #diva #karleusastar #karleusa</p> <p>A post shared by Jelena Karleuša (@karleusa_.diva) on Dec 8, 2017 at 3:16am PST</p>   <p></p>      <p>A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Aug 10, 2017 at 9:25pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>A Serbian pop sensation and a self-proclaimed diva accused Kim of copying her style of hair color and also alleged that Beyonce borrowed her ideas of dressing. The Met Gala gown wore by Beyonce and them Kim K were actually first introduce by Jelena according to her.</p> <h2>2. Lady Gaga copies Madonna</h2>      <p> 🎼</p> <p>A post shared by Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) on Oct 15, 2017 at 6:06pm PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> Dont Give Me any Lip 💋💋💋 Jimmy Fallon!! 😂🎉🌈🔥🤡💯♥️@jimmyfallon @mdnaskin @andylecompte @visionaaron @eyobyohannes @fallontonight @ysl #givegoodface #mdnaskin @moschino</p> <p>A post shared by Madonna (@madonna) on Sep 25, 2017 at 11:48am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>There is an unmistakable connection between the way Lady Gaga dresses up and performs being heavily driven by Madonna’s earlier performances. Although Gaga is respectful of Madonna’s contributions to the pop scene but she inadvertently copies her style way too much. So much so that it made Madonna take a jab at the singer in her single ‘Two Steps Behind Me’. The lyrics mock Lady Gaga for being unoriginal. Later Madonna also made it clear she did not appreciate Gaga almost stealing her hit single of 1989 ‘Express Yourself’.</p> <h2>1. Ariana Grande copies Mariah Carey</h2>      <p> sure do have a lotta footage @alfredoflores</p> <p>A post shared by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on Sep 19, 2017 at 8:34pm PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> Thank you to all who came out last night to help raise awareness for World AIDS Day ♥️ @aidshealthcare #AHFWAD #IAMAHF #AHF30 📷 @gettyimages</p> <p>A post shared by Mariah Carey (@mariahcarey) on Dec 1, 2017 at 1:51pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Call it artistry or just plain imitation but Ariana Grande is a good impressionist with her earlier performance of copying Britney Spears in her 2010 Youtube video. She has also impersonated Celine Dion on ‘Late Night with Jimmy Fallon’. The most recent case is the Mariah Carey’s fans accusing the young artist of drawing too much style in her music notes and the way she delivers them.</p>     <p>When asked from Mariah Carey she wished Ariana sustainable career growth hinting at imitation is always short lived unlike original creativity.</p>   <i></i>
