Marriage is not what you do everyday, is happens mostly once in your during your life. As a human being you want to make this experience as memorable as possible. People think hard to find a way to make their marriage popular among their social circle. Well two love birds Matt and Kalin found an unorthodox way of doing this. All thanks to Ashley Abel to click a photo with such idea which can express the love between the couple as well as their parents. After all, marriage involves the family too.</p> <h2>The wedding location and the scenic place:</h2> <p>We all dream of that perfect wedding – surrounded by our closest friends and family, all dressed up, joyous and in love. And, of course, that perfect wedding photoshoot. Kalin, 28, and Alex Haley, 28, had it all planned. After exchanging vows at Essex Park, Connecticut, in October 7th, the couple and their guests went to The Lace Factory in Deep River to snap some photographs together.</p> <p>The event space is a former shipbuilding yard from 1875 located about 40 minutes of a steam train ride from the place where their wedding ceremony was performed. The couple found the general look of the place perfect for the photoshoot. The picturesque background is self evident of the beauty that it holds and forms a perfect photoshoot place with family.</p> <p>We certainly agree, judging from the photo below with those trees, ancient train and mild weather.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1625.jpeg"/>Yahoo.com <h2>The real reason of limelight:</h2> <p>While photographer Ashley Abel did a fantastic job overall, there is one photo that stands out from the rest in its sentimentality. In the photograph, Kalin and Alex stand on the train tracks, lips locked in a deep kiss. On either side of them stand their respective parents, also kissing their partners. This picture was the main reason behind the popularity that this photoshoot received. This innovative idea not only showed the love existing between the couple, but also expressed the affection existing in the older generation of their families. The photograph is worthy enough to praise the photographer and appreciate the parents for smooching each other in front of their children. Or may be the grandchildren as well, when the couple would show the photographs to their kids.</p>     <h2>Here is what Kalin said regarding the photoshoot:</h2> <p>“Ashley suggested that everyone kiss and initially our parents said, ‘No, no’ and were apprehensive but they just went for it,” Kalin tells <em>Yahoo Lifestyle</em>. “Then Matt’s father saw my dad dip my mom — you can see her laughing in the photo — so he did it too.”</p> <p>This statement clearly conveys the thing that we mentioned above. The parents rejected the idea of kissing each other in front of their children, initially. But then they decided to bow in front of the couple’ happiness. The smooching, dipping and holding done by two generations simultaneously is worth looking again and again. Have a look at it and show it to your friends too, and start planning the same or nearly the same thing which they did.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1626.jpeg"/>Yahoo.com <h2>Ashley’s remarks:</h2> <p>How can the reporter miss the photographer’s remarks? She was happy and joyous, considering the lovely thing that has happened. Here is what she said:</p> <p>“I wanted to do something different,” Ashley told A Plus. “The bride’s parents and the groom’s parents were so cute with each other, and you could tell they are both still really in love.”</p> <p>These remarks from Ashley speaks out and summarizes the uniqueness and innovation in this photo. A photographer fitting the love of two generation, that too in the wedding shoot is not what you expect too often. Even many popular photographers fail to do this, but she somehow found a way to breakthrough.</p> <h2>What makes it special:</h2> <p>What makes this photograph so beautifully nostalgic is the fact that it shows two generations of lasting love. On the left are Matt’s mother and father, both 65, who have been married for nearly 50 years. On the right are Kalin’s mother, 61, and father, 55, who have been married for 30 years.</p> <p>And, in the middle of them, are the newlywed couple who have dated for 10 years and got engaged on a hike in Petaluma, California.</p>     <p>The couple say that the photograph is extremely precious to them as it represents the tight bond between their families. They are grateful to share that special moment with their parents and give each of them their own spotlight. “It reminds me that love can conquer all,” Kalin adds.</p>   <i></i>
