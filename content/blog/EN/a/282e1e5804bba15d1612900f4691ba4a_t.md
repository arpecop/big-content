We’re always looking for the next best thing to improve our way of life, whether it’s our political climate or our diets. But, being on the move all the time, sometimes we need something that’s easy, fast and efficient. Thank God for vending machines! You’d be surprised to hear that today vending machines has more than your basic chocolate, chips and soda. There are some pretty strange things you can find in your trusty old vending machines and we’ll be here to guide through it.</p> <h2>Caviar</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2298-2-png.png"/>Shutterstock <p>Yes, you heard it here folks, caviar in a vending machine! Los Angeles has some rad caviar vending machines, but they aren’t available on just any block. You’ll have to take a trip to one of the three malls where you can find these vending machines. The three malls are Westfield Century City, Westbank Topanga, and Burbank Town Center. Whoever came up with the idea of putting caviar in a vending machine must have known that this pricy delicacy requires an acquired taste and a whole lot of cash it’s no wonder he set up these vending machines in only three locations. I mean who is going to spend five hundred dollars on some fish eggs? Not me!</p> <h2>Underwear</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2298-2298-1-jpg-1.jpeg"/>theHUB // Youtube <p>This one is not edible but more on the novelty side. Underwear in a vending machine might seem a bit strange but not in Japan! You see we think it’s a great idea, you never know when you’re going to need a fresh pair of undies. The western world might find it weird but they really need to catch up as these vending machines come with a variety of options. If you’re too shy to go and get your underwear from these vending machines, then don’t worry as they are hidden so discretion is not an issue.</p> <h2>Pet Food</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2298-3-png.png"/>Shutterstock <p>So you’re out grocery shopping and get in your car to drive home when suddenly you remember that you forgot to pick up some dog food for your puppy! Fear not, now you can get your hands on pet food through a vending machine. Hey if there’s a market out, it’s going to work out as a business idea no matter how crazy it might seem. But did you know the original idea actually came from Turkey? Yes, originally it was a way to encourage people to recycle and feed stray animals on the streets.</p> <p>For every bottle that gets donated, food would pour out into a bowl in the machine to any stray dog or cat that stopped at the machine. You can even donate water! Just pour water into the second slot and voila no more thirsty animals. This is the kind of humanity I can get behind. At first the locals were worried that these machines might attract a lot of strays and it would be hard to control them but that never happened. The success of these machines has struck the interest of 61 other countries who are ready to set up such machines, they’re also ready to be set up around 20 other cities in Turkey.</p> <h2>Gold</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2298-4-png.png"/>Shutterstock <p>Gold from a vending machine? Now I’ve seen it all! Think of it as a different form of a cash machine. Now the machine will update the price of the gold every ten minutes depending on increase or decrease of the cost of gold on the market. This might seem like a strange idea but surprisingly these machines are a great hit throughout Europe, the United Kingdom, and the Emirates. It might have been a better idea to set up these machines during a time when gold was used as a currency but who are we to judge. It might be wiser to get a t-shirt or a keychain to take back home from your fabulous trip as a lot of people use these machines as a novelty.</p> <h2>Mashed Potatoes</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2298-5-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>There’s nothing like a big comforting bowl of mashed potatoes to get you through a hard day. But, mashed potatoes from a vending machine? We’re not sure about that, as you can just whip up your own batch at home but if you’re too lazy ten head over to these machines and get your comfort fix. We hate to burst your bubble but these vending machines are only available at Seven Elevens in Singapore and the country behind this idea is in no rush to expand their business to other countries. So, if you live in Singapore you can still get your mashed potatoes for just one dollar and if you want gravy that’s extra.</p> <h2>Socks</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2298-6-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If you thought the vending machine geniuses were going to stop at underwear, you’re wrong. Now you can get fresh, new and quality socks right from your vending machine. We think this is a great idea, as there have been plenty of times where we’ve left the house without our socks matching or found a hole in them. Originally these machines were for runners who get really sweaty and smelly feet throughout their run but we think it would be a great idea to buy a pair of these socks for homeless people on the streets.</p>     <h2>Vending Machine Restaurant</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2298-7-png.png"/>Shutterstock <p>If you’re a fan of fast food but not so much a fan of talking to the cashiers, then we have the answers to your problems. The Netherlands have taken this idea to a whole new level. They’ve invented vending machine restaurants for you to satisfy your hunger without getting anxious about socializing with other people. But, don’t expect gourmet meals with fine dining, and a waiter to cater to your needs. Think more on the side of burgers, wings and fries, that’s more the style they’re going for. Maybe in the future the inventers of the caviar machines can team up with the inventers of the restraint machine and creat some magic by producing a five-star vending machine culinary experience. Hey, you never know, anything can happen!</p> <h2>Guitar Strings</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2298-8-png.png"/>Shutterstock <p>Imagine, you’re setting up your equipment for an epic night to wow the crowd with your latest song, when suddenly your guitar string breaks! What can you do? The nearest guitar shop is closed and you’ll never make it back in time to play if you go home to grab your spare. Instead of beating yourself up for not being prepared, you can just go down to the street to grab a spare guitar string from the vending machine.</p> <p>Problem solved! That is, if you live in Melbourne Australia, or else you’re out of luck. A company in Aussie has set up these machine throughout the city so now you have no excuse to miss your practice, as the machine also comes with other equipment like drumsticks, guitar picks, cables, ad straps so all your music related equipment has a back. We wonder if the company plans on expanding anytime soon as we can see it doing really well.</p> <h2>Eggs</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2298-9-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If you thought eggs were too delicate to dispense through a vending machine you might be right. That’s why the creators were one step ahead and made it to so the customer can easily open the compartment after inserting their money. Now whether the eggs are cracked or not is another story. But , we think this is a great idea if you want to make some eggs for breakfast but don’t want to take the trip to the grocery store. These machines are situated all over Japan and we hope to see them make an appearance in the western world.</p> <h2>Milk</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2298-10-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>I don’t if I feel comfortable buying milk from a vending machine, but to each their own! Manufactured and produced by the company known as Direct Lait in France, these vending machines allows to purchase a liter of milk for just $1.30. Seems like a good deal.</p> <h2>Canned Bread</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2298-11-png.png"/>Shutterstock <p>Now, we don’t exactly understand why you would need to buy canned bread when you can easily get your hands on fresh bread but the world is a strange place and people do strange things. Available in Japan we don’t really see these machines making their way to the western world as the sound of canned bread doesn’t seem appealing at all. But if there was an apocalyptic situation where you would need to stock up on bread, canned bread would be the best options as it would last longer if it was sealed in a can. But I think we’ll stick to our fresh bread for now.</p> <h2>Alcohol</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2298-12-png.png"/>Pxhere <p>Sometimes, it seems we’re living in 2017 and Japan is living in 2050. This revolutionary concept screams success as you can just imagine how much easier it is to purchase your alcohol instead of going to the liquor store with the cashier sitting behind a bullet-proof window. Shady, I know! This just makes things so much easier, all you have to do is swipe your credit card and chose your desired drink and you’re good to go. We can see this becoming a hit world-wide!</p> <h2>Live Crab</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2298-13-png.png"/>Shutterstock     <p>Now if you think Japan has the weirdest vending machine, you need to make a trip to China to see this gem. The People’s Republic has vending machines stocked with live crabs! Yes, live crabs and the company behind it even promises to give you a free refund if your crab isn’t breathing! But how do they manage to keep them alive in a vending machine you might ask? The crabs are kept in the machine at a very cold temperature to ensure that they survive and the machine gets restocked every day so we guess it’s fresh. Not only do you get the crab for just three dollars which is pretty cheap but it also comes with a side of vinegar for your crab and ginger tea! I don’t know about you but, I’m going to stick to buying my crabs from a fish market where they are all packed together.</p>   <i></i>
