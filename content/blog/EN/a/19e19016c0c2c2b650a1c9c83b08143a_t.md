         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 2<p>Relationships have their difficulties – everyone knows that. But to make sure that a relationship recovers form a down period, we need to realize that sometimes, both parties just need some space apart. That doesn’t necessarily mean ending the relationship. Rather, the “alone-time” focuses on making things better. It prompts both parties to look into each other’s and their own mistakes. It allows them some time away from each other in order to rectify those mistakes. It may lead to both discovering certain values in the relationship that may lead to eventual success, not only in the relationship in question, but in each person’s own life as well.</p> <h2>#19 You’re always fighting</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2208-1-jpg.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>Fighting doesn’t necessarily indicate a lack of friendship or love between two people. Friends and family fight all the time, yet the love is still there. For a couple, fighting may just indicate a strong bond between the two. A husband may yell at his wife if she hurts herself doing something. That is a healthy sign. It indicates that he actually cares for his wife enough to coerce her. If the husband however, yells at his wife for petty, unimportant reasons or vice versa, it may just mean that they’re frustrated and need some time apart before that frustration ruins their relationship. A little time apart is, in the long run, a small price to pay to save a relationship you truly hold dear.</p> <h2>#18 Its one-sided</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2208-2-jpg.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>A husband tries his best to have a good time with his wife. He takes her to the movies. He takes her on romantic dinners. However he doesn’t feel that his enthusiasm is being reciprocated. She seems quiet. Her attention seems diverted. It may just mean that she feels her husband is rushing, taking her out of her comfort zone. If you feel that enthusiasm in the relationship isn’t being responded to in a way that you like, the smartest thing to do may just be to back off. Give your partner some time to get used to the environment. If your enthusiasm makes the other uncomfortable, just lower it down a notch. Your love won’t be getting any less.</p> <h2>#17 There’s too much on your mind</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2208-3-jpg.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>So you’re stressed from work. You come home to your wife who looks at you and realizes how worked up you are. She tries her best to comfort you. She asks about your problems and engages you in a conversation. But the stress gets to you and you in return yell at her, be mean to her, even blaming her for some of the stress. What you are actually doing is foiling a seemingly good relationship. If you feel the work-stress getting to you and creating barriers in your love-life, rather than let be as it is, it may be a good idea to give it some space. Deliberately distance yourself from it. In the end, you may just be doing yourself a favor.</p> <h2>#16 Its dull</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2208-4-jpg.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>What should you do if you find yourself “just not having fun” in the relationship? You imagined it would be fun and exciting. You and your spouse will be sharing meals together, watching movies together among a ton of other stuff. But you’re actually just living a boring routine of “good morning-good night” with or him or her. You’re just not <em>feeling it</em>. The best course of action in that case would be to just give your partner and yourself some space. Work out your expectations from the relationship and what you <em>can actually</em> get out of it. Work out ways in which the relationship can actually be fun. At the least, find a hobby that both can share.</p> <h2>#15 You feel suffocated</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2208-5-jpg.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>A wife feels that her husband is overwhelming her in the relationship. He expects too much from her in most aspects of their married life. She feels “emotionally suffocated”. Although satisfying each other’s needs may be a prerequisite of a married life, some people just feel themselves stressing out over the issue. That’s when communication becomes key. If you feel yourself being suffocated in the relationship, discuss it over with your partner. Ask them to keep their distance otherwise they risk stressing you over. You may be playing it safe here and it may not always be to your partner’s liking but hey, better safe than sorry.</p> <h2>#14 You miss being single</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2208-6-jpg.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>You miss hanging out with your friends. You feel that somehow your married life is causing a decrease in your personal space to the point that you find yourself becoming nostalgic of the times you were single. That is definitely a bad sign for your relationship. At this point, you should consider giving yourself some time apart from your partner. Work things out with him or her. Go out with your friends if makes you happy. These little pleasures may just save your relationship.</p> <h2>#13 You’re not sure if he’s the one</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2208-7-jpg.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>You were absolutely sure – he <em>was </em>the one. You fast forward to this moment. <em>Is </em>he <em>still</em> the one? That may just be the most dangerous question you ever have to ask yourself in a relationship. It indicates that you are having second thoughts regarding your partner which is dangerous for every relationship. Questions like “did I marry the right one?” are never good signs for the relationship. However it may be that you’re second-guessing yourself out of frustration, something your partner didn’t do right. But people make mistakes so it’s alright. Don’t second-guess yourself over petty issues. If you still find yourself doubtful, then just take some time off. For your partner’s sake and yours, the time and space you get may help you see your future with him or her.</p> <h2>#12 You’re getting irritated</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2208-8-jpg.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>You feel your spouse irritating you more than usual for some reason. “He asks so many questions” and “Why do I have to do everything for her” are some of the questions you’re asking yourself. Irritation and a jittery attitude are never safe for the relationship to progress. It could be from overexposure to your partner. The answer to the problem would the just be to distance yourself from him or her. Make yourself miss them. That way you may actually want them to irritate you. Feelings do work in mysterious ways.</p> <h2>#11 Lack of communication</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2208-9-jpg.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>Good communication between partners in vital for a relationship such as marriage to work smoothly. You much share your thoughts, weaknesses, shortcomings and plans with your partner. However, there is such a thing as miscommunication, which does more harm than good. If you feel like you are not up to communicating efficiently with your partner, it may be wise to take some time apart to resolve your communication issues. On the other hand, if you miscommunicate it may create more troubles than solve them.</p>     <h2>#10 Your partner is jealous</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2208-10-jpg.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>While jealousy may be a healthy factor to distinguish a healthy relationship from an unhealthy one, when your partner begins to feel jealous with regard to your success and ambition, that is where the line should be drawn. The situation is no completely uncalled for. Your spouse may feel that you are growing apart from him or her as you put your focus toward your work. However, when it comes to the point that your partner seemingly wishes for your downfall, in an attempt to bring you closer to him or her, that is when the both need some time apart to work things out.</p> <h2>#9 You’re bored of each other</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2208-11-jpg.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>Spending a great deal of time together, while having its merits, can lead to boredom in a relationship. You begin to feel that you and your spouse are just not “clicking”. That may just be the point where you and your spouse need to take some time to yourselves to recharge. Just relive the merits of life. Watch a movie with your friends or go on a road trip. The boredom may just be a sign that the two of you are beginning to settle into a long-term relationship.</p> <h2>#8 Lack of physical affection</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2208-12-jpg.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>You feel like you husband or wife is less physically active with you. Do you take it as a sign of a lower level attraction? Or do you take as a sign that your spouse feels bored with you? Well, the solution may be in taking a break with one another to make your spouse sort out the intimacy problems he or she feels. It may all be a part of getting used to each other, but playing safe is the better way to act in sorting out relationship problems.</p> <h2>#7 The bad overweighs the good</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2208-13-jpg.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>No one is perfect. The same applies to married people. Your partner may possess habits that irritate you. The same may go for you. But the essence of a strong relationship lies in our abilities to overlook the bad for the sake of the good that both partners have shared. When these small cervices begin to surface and become the source of unending conflict in the relationship, the time comes when both parties but take some time away from each other to ponder over the meaning, the relationship holds for them.</p> <h2>#6 You aren’t happy</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2208-14-jpg.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>The scariest thought that any party in a relationship can think of is the thought that the relationship isn’t a happy one. You are married and your spouse seems to be the perfect choice for you yet still feel lonely, sad and even frustrated. There may be seemingly nothing wrong with your partner, yet you just feel that something about the relationship doesn’t feel right. A little time apart may do the trick for both parties as it will allow them to figure out what is it in the relationship that makes them feel unhappy or uncomfortable. It may make you realize that something completely unrelated makes you feel lonely rather than the relationship itself.</p> <h2>#5 You’re increasingly dependent on you partner</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2208-15-jpg.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>While it may be a good sign that you share your decisions and thought processes with your spouse, it may lead to a deterioration of your own independent thinking. Sure you <em>both</em> decide what foods are good for your children and sure you <em>both</em> decide which college your kid needs to enroll in but mind you some decisions require independent thinking for an individual. If you feel the relationship going down this road, take some time off, till you feel confident to make some of your own decisions.</p> <h2>#4 Your partner is too controlling</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2208-16-jpg.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>Relationships do tend to become slightly one sided when one partner or spouse becomes more controlling. Some humans just have possessive controlling natures (no explanation required). That may stand as a problem in a relationship as you feel your independence flee from you with your partner becoming more bossy than usual. A good step may be to talk to your spouse and take some time off and realize that for the relationship to work, both have to act as partners.</p> <h2>#3 You neglect yourself</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2208-17-jpg.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>An obvious sign that you need space in a relationship is if you’re neglecting yourself to spend time with your partner. While that may be a good thing, everyone needs his or her space. It may be wise choice to communicate this with your spouse or partner so that they may realize that you feel your needs neglected. It may be that your partner may feel the same way about his or herself.</p> <h2>#2 Cute habits no longer have appeal</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2208-18-jpg.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>Your partner’s cute habits don’t seem cute anymore. As a matter of fact, they sort of irritate you. To secure the relationship, a little time away from each other may seem wise. Individuals tend to get used to each other. That may be the reason from the start. But you can’t risk it. You may have other issues you need to take care of on your own.</p> <h2>#1 You don’t like tagging your partner along</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2208-19-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock     <p>You’re going to a friend’s party but you’re having second thoughts about bringing your spouse with. You feel insecure when he or she is with you in public places or around friends. It may even lead to you not sharing your plans with them so as to avoid their asking to join you. That may be a sign that you need some time alone for yourself. What makes you insecure about your partner joining you? Will he embarrass me? These are some questions that you me need to ponder upon. You may have trust issues or you may feel overprotective. That is something you need to resolve for yourself.</p>   <i></i>
