I did a @kickstarter campaign and raised over ¬£20k in funding. üôèüèªthanks to everyone who contributed. The top pledge was for a book and a portrait taken by me. This is @bookstofurnisharoom who came all the way from Ireland to be photographed only to wait half a year for me to work on it! But I think it's worked out really nicely. So thanks for waiting! ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî A year on from the book release and I can't believe it's almost sold out! I only have 28 books in stock! I'm not sure I will do a re-run but I will certainly have to do another project with the amazing @stanleyjamespress üí™üèºüëçüèºüëåüèº and a big thanks to everyone who surprised the book and the project! . . . . . . . . #almahaser #cosmicsurgery #book #kickstarter #paper #portrait #crumpledface #newwork #commission #funded</p> <p>A post shared by Alma Haser (@almahaser) on Jun 8, 2017 at 9:50am PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> The project goes on.

Jacob makes large-scale paper mobile work and is very unique. It‚Äôs not usually seen in other artist‚Äôs work.</p>      <p> Jacob Hashimoto is an artist of japanese descent that draws on his ethnic origins through is work, redefining the screen painting of japan through the assemblage of small paper ‚Äòkites‚Äô which he layers into larger compositions. the individual components themselves are abstract, but when arranged together, they result in graphic imagery composed of clusters of patterns, strips, waves of color creating pictorial images which suggest depictions of vistas, landscapes, scrolling video games or board games. these graphic collages are formed through strings of ‚Äòkites‚Äô which are stretched taut between short dowels that project from wall-mounted brackets, resulting in a densely layered and fragmented tapestry of image or pattern. #jacobhashimoto #YAIINSPO</p> <p>A post shared by Young Artist Initiative (@youngartistinitiative) on Oct 5, 2017 at 5:49am PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> üïäüî¥‚ö™Ô∏èüî∑üíöüî∂‚ö™Ô∏èüî¥üïä JACOB HASHIMOTO Giant and uncertain atmospheres 9 June ‚Äì 24 Sebtember 2017 W√§in√∂ Aaltonen Museum of Art üïä‚ú®It was a marveleus experience to visit this amazing exhibition‚ú®üïä #w√§in√∂aaltosenmuseo #jacobhashimoto #w√§in√∂aaltonenmuseum #wam #turkufinland #turkukuva #loveturku #turkulove #turkulover #turkulovers #kissmyturku #visitturku #modernartist #ilovemuseums #love_turku #loves_turku #√•bo #suomenturku #nykytaide #abstractart #modernart #artlove #artlover #artlovers üïäüíöüïä</p> <p>A post shared by @markhelelo on Sep 25, 2017 at 6:06am PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> The Eclipse- Jacob Hashimoto @leilahellergallery #leilahellergallery #jacobhashimoto #exhibition #art #perspective #nofilter #mydubai #instalike</p> <p>A post shared by Sophie Pan (@sophia_pantelaki) on Oct 5, 2017 at 11:36am PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> Finally getting to see Jacob Hashmioto's miniature kites was utterly profound #art #threedimensional #ricepaper #fishingline #jacobhashimoto</p> <p>A post shared by Reem Al Suwaidi (@ree_alsuwaidi) on Oct 3, 2017 at 8:40am PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> The storm within üå™ #JacobHashimoto</p> <p>A post shared by Asma | ÿ£ÿ≥ŸÖÿß (@theasoom) on Oct 2, 2017 at 7:30am PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> #jacobhashimoto #gasgiant</p> <p>A post shared by @ghvxz on Sep 27, 2017 at 8:11am PDT</p>   <p></p> <h2>Ross Symons</h2> <p>Last but not the least, origami artist Ross creates everyday origami and is doing a 365-day origami project which can be viewed on Instagram.
