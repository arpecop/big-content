Or they may grow disappointed with their orgasms as compared to their partner’s which may be ‘seemingly’ more intense.</p> <p>It is never a good idea to equate how you fared between the sheets because the different factors which might appeal to you may not be the same for someone else. Sex is highly subjective and if you will try to see it as though there are certain standards to be achieved to make sex great you are only mistaken. There is no right or wrong in sex and the best method is the one which makes you enjoy it.</p> <p>However there are certain things one might still feel they might compare to gauge their relationship and their partner’s attraction towards them. It is understandable to be naturally curious about sex life with an aim to become more sexually pleasing for your partner.</p> <p>However it becomes a problem if you take it too seriously since most of the times you will be met with unfavorable, inaccurate results which only hamper your relationship. What is often required is to listen to your own self and trust your gut. If you are satisfied with the way things are in the bedroom chances are you don’t need to compare in the first place.</p> <p>However if there are certain areas you would like to improve consult credible sources like your doctor or therapist, some expert on the subject or scientifically proven studies.</p> <p>Following are some spheres of your sex life where not one approach is better than the other and all variations are acceptable especially if they satisfy you.</p> <h2>7. Duration of sex</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-616.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>This is something which can’t be penned down to a certain time limit. Some couples like to take it slow, some opt for a ‘quickie’ and are done in a matter of minutes. Others may take too long on the foreplay and only indulge after absolutely desperate for each other. Hence comparing how long your sex last is pointless.</p> <h2>6. Intensity of Your Orgasm</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-617.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>There are a number of factors to be taken into account like your body chemistry, your relationship with arousal and the joy of the experience. The factors may vary from time to time hence the intensity of your orgasms may naturally vary. It is not always necessary to have the same orgasm as long as you are enjoying the experience.</p>     <h2>5. Size of labia</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-618.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Porn would make us believe that all women are anatomically similar down there but that is another lie. Many women have smaller labia, others might have much larger visible clitoris. The point is vulvas come in all shapes and sizes, more important to remember is the fact that none is less attractive than other.</p> <h2>4. Time it takes to orgasm</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-619.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Biologically we are all experiencing similar stimulation but in some cases a person may come a lot quicker while another may take a lot more time. This doesn’t mean you are less in tuned with your partner’s stimulation. Infact in certain cases a woman may be unable to achieve orgasm at all but the sex is still pleasurable for them.</p> <h2>3. Looking for emotions in sex</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-620.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Again it depends on different factors. If you are in a long term relationship there will be an association with the person and you will be more emotionally drawn to them. However if you are only having a one night stand with an out of town friend the affair will be more physical rather than emotionally connecting with other person.</p> <p>So comparing all the different experiences sex has to offer is quite pointless and rather one should just go with the flow (no pun intended).</p> <h2>2. Libido or sex drive</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-621.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>We are constantly told about different ways and methods to increase our sex drive and have a much healthier relationship with a lot more contact. However we need to understand that sexual relations are best when consensual.</p> <p>It is perfectly ok to be interested in sex all the time or not too inclined towards the subject at all. Both the partners need to strike a balance between themselves and just indulge when they actually feel like it.</p> <h2>1. Your previous sexual activity</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-622.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It doesn’t matter if you have had a lot of partners previously or are waiting for the right individual and still a virgin, your sexual activity will never in any way affect you or your partner’s attitude towards loving each other.</p>     <p>This should not bother you at all since you can still be a great lover without actual experience of making love.</p>   <i></i>
