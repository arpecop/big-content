         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 0<p>Having the perfect boyfriend is probably not possible as there is no such thing as a perfect boyfriend. If you think that your bae is perfect for you, think again, as there is a mighty chance that your guy has some annoying traits based on his zodiac sign.</p> <p>However, don’t be alarmed if there are some habits of your boyfriend that you just can’t stand as there are no perfect relationships. While your boyfriend’s zodiac sign might not tell a whole lot about him it can point you in some direction. Zodiac signs can in some cases help you better understand your boyfriend.</p> <p>If he has certain habits that are just too annoying for you, perhaps his zodiac sign has more to do with it than the poor guy himself. You love him! Yet there are things that drive you crazy about him right? Read on and find out which annoying habits he has based on his zodiac sign. The more you learn the better you will be able to handle the annoying habits of your perfect boyfriend.</p> <h2>Scorpio</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-352.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>Scorpios always want to be right and it is super annoying to be with someone who is always trying to wrong you. If your boyfriend is always insisted on being right then his Zodiac sign is actually playing a big role in shaping his personality.</p> <p>The problem with Scorpios is that whenever you are having a serious conversation with them they force you to admit that you are wrong. This is not only annoying but also super frustrating. Couples have ended breaking up just because they couldn’t admit they were wrong. If you bae is a Scorpio then you can forget about winning an argument with him.</p> <p>It is hard work dating a guy who always wants to be right. If you boyfriend is a Zodiac then perhaps you can get him to cut this bad habit to let the relationship grow further.</p> <p>Perhaps the bigger problem is that Scorpios are very jealous and never like their partner to have a friendship with the opposite sex. If your boyfriend is always jealous of your friends and work buddies then you have a serious problem. A situation like this eats away a relationship which is destined to fail.</p> <h2>Libra</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-353.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>Libras just hate conflict; if they seem themselves in a conflict they will probably shut themselves out and pretend as if nothing has happened. This is perhaps their most annoying trait which needs to be curbed. Staying in a relationship with a boyfriend who refuses to address a problem is a big problem. You can’t move forward without talking with him about the problem in the relationship.</p> <p>You obviously would want to sit down with your boyfriend and have a heart-to-heart talk regarding problems in the relationship. Staying with a Libra in a relationship is hard work which requires patience from your side. If you boyfriend is Libra then you shouldn’t wait for him to sit and talk to you. Take lead and make him listen to you. Talk to your partner because that’s normal in a healthy relationship.</p> <p>Libras aren’t forgiving people, which is perhaps their most annoying trait. If you can’t forgive someone then you cannot live your life to the fullest. Libras only harm themselves by not forgiving others. If your boyfriend doesn’t forgive people then his Zodiac sign is to be blamed for it. Libras hold grudges for like ever which is not cool. Sit down with your boyfriend and tell him to learn to forgive and forget.</p> <h2>Virgo</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-354.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>Virgos like to be super independent which makes it difficult for them to help them in anything. Virgos always want to take charge and do everything on their own, even when they need help they will never ask for it. If your boyfriend doesn’t let you help him then it can get frustrating for you and even have a negative impact on the relationship.</p> <p>Living with someone who constantly stops you from helping him becomes very frustrating. For a relationship to flourish it is important that your boyfriend appreciates your help from time to time. If your boyfriend doesn’t let you help him then what’s the point of staying in the relationship.</p> <p>Another frustrating trait about Virgos is that they worry a lot. They intend to worry about a lot of things that are happening in their life.</p> <h2>Capricorn</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-355.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>If your boyfriend acts as if he knows everything then he is a Capricorn. Capricorns like to know everything and hate it when others know more than them. However, don’t be alarmed as it is pretty cool to meet a smart guy who has answers to almost everything.</p> <p>On the other hand, having a conversation with Capricorns is something that should be avoided. Being in a relationship with a person who always betters you in knowing everything can be tiresome and frustrating. He is smart okay fine, but he also needs to let you match his intellect as well.</p> <p>Look at his smart attitude in a positive way as you liked him for being smart right? Being in a relationship with a Capricorn is easy.</p> <h2>Sagittarius</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-356.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>If you care about them they call you clingy, this is their most frustrating trait. Apparently if you meet them a lot, stay with them a lot, talk to them a lot then you are being clingy. This can get very frustrating for you if you boyfriend is Sagittarius.</p> <p>Sagittarius boyfriends usually call their partners clingy, so if your boyfriend is Sagittarius then you might have already been called clingy. He might have also said that he needs space, okay fine, give him space but if he can’t get over it then you two aren’t meant for each other. Instead of staying in such a toxic relationship it is better to opt out of it. Let’s be honest no one likes being called clingy.</p>     <h2>Leo</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-357.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>Overconfidence is their biggest flaw. Leos almost always tend to be overconfident in all situations. You are probably familiar with that if you date a Leo. You might want him to tone down a bit, however, that is something that won’t happen. Leos just can’t tone down their overconfidence. You might try talking to him but he won’t change.</p> <p>If he is hot and charming then he knows his overconfidence suits his personality. And let’s face it you liked him for his looks and confidence. Enjoy his overconfidence and let the relationship grow for his sake and yours.</p> <h2>Cancer</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-358.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>Cancer signs are mostly pessimistic and a bit negative. Being in a relationship with a guy who doesn’t always look at the bright side can be frustrating. If you are more on the positive side then living with a pessimist can be a challenge.</p> <p>However, having a cancer as your boyfriend is better as this guy is more realistic and takes life seriously. He worries about the things in his life which shows he is honest instead of guys who pretend to be always happy. The 24/7 happy guys are liars, yes you read it right they are liars. So better be in a relationship with a Cancer than a liar.</p> <p>It is perfectly normal to have ups and downs in life. If your boyfriend takes life as it is then you are lucky to have him.</p> <h2>Gemini</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-359.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>Gemini boyfriend has the worse time making choices, but it is not his fault, that’s how he is programmed thanks to his Zodiac sign. They always take too long to make a decision which for you might be frustrating. Living with someone who can’t make a decision can be very frustrating.</p> <p>Minor things like choosing a place for dinner or a bar could become a problem for you guys. Such situation can also lead to a heated argument. However, you should be more understanding and compassionate towards him as he isn’t doing this to annoy you. Again it’s not him, it’s his Zodiac sign.</p> <p>If you love him enough perhaps it is time for you to start making decision for him.</p> <h2>Taurus</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-360.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>Taurus are extremely stubborn people. Their Zodiac sign is represented by a bull which practically tells it all about their personality. If your boyfriend is Taurus then you probably know what we are talking about.</p> <p>Small things like choosing a pizza or a burger can make you scream at the top of yours lungs, why? Well he might be too stubborn to agree to your choice for dinner. Making him agree to your suggestions is a distant probability. Most likely you will always end up letting him have the final say.</p> <p>You will almost always lose trying to change his mind. Stubborn people are very difficult to live with as reaching a mutual agreement is very rare. If you are living with a stubborn person then the best you can do is learn on which issue you can bend him. Avoid getting into conflict then them in order to save the relationship.</p> <h2>Aries</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-361.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>Bad moods are principle traits of Aries. If you boyfriend is pretty moody then it is basically normal for an Aries. At the start of the relationship you might ignore the bad mood of you bae, but come on living with a moody person can get tiresome.</p> <p>Seriously for how long can you ignore a guy with mood swings. However, Aries are great people to spend time with when they are in a good mood. You can probably ignore your boyfriend when he is in a bad mood to avoid any conflict, you will be surprised but this could help in keeping the relationship intact.</p> <h2>Pisces</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-362.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Okay so the problem with Pisces is that they just can’t handle any criticism. If you criticize them be prepared to face their wrath. Don’t criticize your boyfriend all the time because that would be creepy, however, there are moments when you just can’t stay silent.</p> <p>Talk to him and let him know what is it that he did to make you upset. Talking is the key to keeping your relationship healthy. Dealing with a Pisces requires skill as you cannot criticize him to an extent that would trigger a conflict in your relationship.</p> <h2>Aquarius</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-363.jpeg"/>ShutterStock <p>The problem with Aquarius is that they are not emotional. If your boyfriend is Aquarius then it is most likely that he finds it extremely difficult to express his emotions. Do not think badly of him, because he being unemotional doesn’t mean that he doesn’t love you. He just can’t be expressive enough even when he wants to be.</p> <p>Instead of getting mad at him accept him for who he is. Just make sure that you two talk with each other regularly to keep the relationship steady.</p>     <p>If you have enough information about the Zodiac signs of your boyfriend, you can respond accordingly and prevent a perfect relationship from ending. After all these things are written in stars and can’t be changed.</p>   <i></i>
