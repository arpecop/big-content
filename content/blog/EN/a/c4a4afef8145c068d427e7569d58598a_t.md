It’s just that despite all their efforts in certain respects, men just can’t understand where the woman in coming from. While it’s fine to have a decent expectation from everyone, it is often detrimental if your expectations are too overwhelming, because being let down hurts. The truth is, when it comes to men, simplicity is key and it’s always better to be realistic in your thoughts for not only the men’s but also your own interest. Though men do put in a decent amount of effort into more or less all of these issues, there are certain things they just aren’t programmed to grasp! Here are some things all women wish men understood better</p> <h2>I’m fine</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1447.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Gentlemen, when a woman tells you she’s fine, consider her putting up the red flag. She is not fine, not by any means. Usually said just to move away from the issue at hand, we admit this could be a bit confusing, if not hypocritical. The underlying simplicity however, is that if men listen any better and try to consider things in context rather than isolation, the meaning of these two very common words becomes crystal clear. Unfortunately, men never seem to get this right! The stereotype is real guys, when a girl says she’s fine, she isn’t!</p> <h2>I need space</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1448.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>They say time heals all, but let us speak from unanimously agreed experience – it doesn’t, when the time is handed to a woman. Ladies over-think, over-analyze and constantly live in a situation where the issue that sparked contention keeps lingering on in their minds. Kind of like the previous point, when your significant other tells you she needs space, no! It means she wants you to fight for her! Women constantly want to feel special, wanted and loved. When she tells you to go away or when she asks you to leave her alone, she usually expects you to show up at her door with flowers or a pizza and apologize. Make peace, not war!</p> <h2>Women know the truth</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1449.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Gentlemen, here’s a little something that will go the extra mile with you when you do. When a woman asks you a question, 99% of the time, she also knows the answer. Why were you online till so late? Where did you disappear off to in your lunch break? Women who ask, are women who already know, more or less. The thing is, women have a very sensitive trust, which is incredibly easy to break and can cause permanent and plastic damage. She will even change the way she looks at and thinks of you. Know you should answer quickly and never lie when she asks you, because the longer you make her wait, the longer she’ll be convinced you’re lying. Come clean, and save yourself all the trouble.</p> <h2>Fantasies</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1450.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The perfect walk on the beach during sunset, a bouquet of red roses, a nice fireworks show while holding hands – all of this may sound very cliché and overdone since it’s what a Nicholas Sparks movie basically is, but we promise you it’s there for a reason! Women love fantasies and recalling them in their mind repeatedly, hoping perhaps one day their man really will sweep them off their feet. As mentioned before, women just want to feel special and they just want to feel loved. There’s no limit you have to reach in make her feeling so, though. It’s fine if your walk down the park wasn’t exactly A Walk To Remember, just put in a little effort and her day will be made!</p> <h2>Guessing games</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1451.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It’s fair at this point to say men aren’t mind-readers to always know that when saying “I’m fine” applies literally and when it means the opposite, but here’s the deal. Women aren’t all guessers either. As per research, men tend to stay very reserved and do not show and express their feelings and emotions as often or even as openly as women, which is no good news. Why is it so hard for men to communicate their feelings? Well, maybe because women do so too openly and for doing so, men are titled to be female. To the men reading this whose genuine fear is what we’ve just discussed, we say be brave! It’s alright to be a woman, and if it means being able to process the situation and express your emotions, we say men are better off as women in this regard!</p>     <h2>Forgetting dates</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1452.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If there is one negligence every man is guilty of performing, it’s forgetting important dates. No we don’t mean the dates you’ve been on or the delicious and chunky little fruit, we’re talking anniversaries, birthdays, get-togethers and last dates. Men are indeed forgetful and if your husband doesn’t remember your colleague’s son’s birthday party though the invites came in two weeks ago, there’s nothing wrong with him. Generally, just because they don’t remember the dates doesn’t mean they don’t attach significance to them either! It’s just that men are wired to retain little by little and if there’s even a little disinterest, it’ll go a very long way!</p> <h2>Act like a man!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1453.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>How about a little illustration? Let’s say you go for a nice dinner. Hold the door of the car open for her. Let her walk first and maintain your pace. Open the restaurant door and when she’s sitting I her seat, push it in! Make her feel comfortable! Women all want to be treated with respect before anything else and need special care if you’re going to make her the one, unless she is already. Women love getting treated nicely, but let’s face it – who doesn’t? Chivalry isn’t dead, it’s actually resurrecting. Just make sure you take the steps necessary (Pun intended) to be at her place on time when picking her up. Be sure to knock on the door instead of honking the car horn and waiting there in. Learn from the good old days, gentlemen!</p> <h2>Gifts</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1454.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>When it comes to gifts, men are so clueless not even Blue from Blue’s Clues can help. With chocolates, flowers, a perfume or cleaning supplies kit being the norm, women all over the world can agree that it needs to change. Unless your lady has told you expressly that there is this one perfume she wants, which is highly unlikely, don’t get her a perfume! The safest bet you can place when it comes to giving ladies a nice gift is simply to gift them jewelry! They say diamonds are a girl’s best friend, but you don’t always have to make it so big. Sometimes, men feel adventurous and think presenting clothes will be a good idea. Guys, think clothes, think wrong size and refunds or exchange! Stick to jewelry, you can’t go wrong!</p> <h2>Hair ties</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1455.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>They say it’s all fun and games until it happens to you and when it comes to women always gracing their wrists with a hair tie, men just don’t seem to get the deal. The truth is, girls need hair ties all the time because you just never know when the situation calls for it. The cause of concern may be legitimate in certain scenarios, especially the fact that it might cut off the circulation in the wrists, but come on! It’s 2017! They even have hair ties now that look just like bracelets, that’s how real the struggle is! Alas, maybe men will understand if they ever grow long hair of their own and need it for themselves!</p> <h2>Outfit advice</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1456.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Consulting men for dressing and fashion advice is useless, plain and simple. Men, though their own aesthetics may be on point for themselves, don’t understand how certain prints and patterns shouldn’t be worn together. Oblivious to the concept of shades, hues and extended color families, men don’t know much, if at all, when it comes to your clothing. Someone needs to explain to all men, everywhere, that you can’t throw on a pair of heels with everything nor can you dress in as little as possible all the time, contrary to men’s wishes. If you want real fashion advice, don’t consult a man unless he is a proper professional!</p> <h2>Makeup</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1457.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Gentlemen, though this might be difficult, we have to accept that Sephora is important for our ladies. The hours spent inside, browsing the products, are all very justifiable and the fact that makeup is expensive makes proper sense as well! When it comes to makeup, some women like more and some like less, but the fact of the matter usually is that women dress up and wear makeup for no one but themselves! Though all men, everywhere, accept that too much makeup is definitely a turn-off, men don’t understand the shading and mixing and blending. Contouring makes no sense to men and neither does applying highlights but that shouldn’t stop you from looking your best!</p>     <p>So ladies, and gentlemen (We are not sexist), here were some things all women wish man knew! Did we leave something out? Let us know!</p>   <i></i>
