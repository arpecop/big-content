Nod your head if you have spent almost as much as GDP of a small island country at Victoria’s Secret just to find the perfect fit which would transform your A-cup to a B or D (a girl can be hopeful). Get off your seat and give me a hug if you have also, like me, spent hours trying to learn how to boob contour over YouTube.</p> <p>After years of insecurity and hiding behind the shame of my A-cup, I came to a sort of self-awakening. In my mid-twenties, I developed this mindset and accepted the fact that I didn’t have much, boob-wise and I wasn’t going to let that shame me. We all love curvy and sexy but flat can be fabulous too. Following are some styling tips for my fellow flat girls to help them embrace (and rock) their flat selves.</p> <h2>15. Go braless</h2>      <p> #LOVEWINS #LONDON ❤️🦋❤️🙏🏼🙏🏼💋💋💋🌷🌹🌸🌺🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈#KAGE</p> <p>A post shared by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Jul 8, 2017 at 4:31pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Yaas girl! If you have small boobs you also have perky boobs which means no sagging. This also means that unlike the bustier girls, you don’t need to wear a bra all that often. There are many dresses out there on the market (and on fashion runways) which have a no-bra rule. There are girls with small boobs who are hesitant to go braless because nipples. To them we say that going braless is an amazing opportunity to feel sexy with a subtle naughtiness thrown here and there. As for them nipples, try a fashion tape and you are Kardashian-Jenner level red carpet ready!</p> <h2>14. Graphic Tees</h2>      <p> Deja que tu ropa hable por ti. #EstampaTrends #NewArrivals #GraphicTees #Panamá</p> <p>A post shared by Estampapanama (@estampapanama) on Oct 29, 2017 at 9:07am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Graphic tees are cute, right? Yes, we agree. They come in a plethora of different designs and graphics and you can always find something that is interesting and quirky. I personally love the ones with texts and quotes over them. I also love to match these with my mood for the day (yes, I have <em>that </em>many graphic tees). It’s like wearing my thoughts on my T shirt. Bustier women complain that wearing graphic tees makes them feel a lot more self-conscious than other types of clothes. Big boobs can not only alter the aesthetics of these tees but also draw a lot of uncalled for attention. You might think people passing by on the street are staring and squinting at your bosom while they might just be trying to make out the design or read what’s on it. The feeling can be even worse if someone points at your tee and laughs (because it says something funny). So count you’re a cup a blessing and stock up on these graphic tees because you can rock them harder than anyone else.</p> <h2>13. Button down those shirts</h2>      <p> Was feeling like Selena on my way to Las Vegas. #landingoutfit #selena #hoops #casual #buttondowns #denim #gold #bralette #fashion #ootd #lasvegas</p> <p>A post shared by Carolina Coello (@hauntedbyghosts) on Oct 29, 2017 at 3:24pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Another plus of having smaller boobs is that you can button down your button-up shirts and roll back the sleeves for a more casual look. Bustier women give a very sexy look with the shirt and buttons stretched across the chest and it might make you just a tad bit jealous. But button that thing down (may be pair it with a bralette) and see the magic unfold. Easy, breezy, lemon squeezy.</p> <h2>12. While we are talking about the bralette</h2>      <p> I'd rather be eating tacos 🌮</p> <p>A post shared by Sarah Hyland (@sarahhyland) on Jan 13, 2017 at 1:37pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Say Hallelujah and add one more blessing to your small-chested girls’ list because you can totally pull off a bralette as a shirt. These have been featured in every blog, catalogue and magazine recently and look super cute. These are meant for women of every shape and size and are form hugging with intricate details. Originally meant to be worn underneath shirts and dresses for a classy my-bra-is-peeking-through-my-dress look, bralettes look equally charming when worn without anything on top. As these can be a snug fit and really emphasize the chest, bralettes draw only more attention to the chest instead of focus on the overall outfit. Girls with small boobs can easily pull off a charming, playful look with bralettes keeping all the focus on their gorgeous outfit. You can also pair bedazzled blazers or fancy lacy tops with bralettes for a night out in the town.</p> <h2>11. Them cropped tops</h2>      <p> Crop tops, abs &amp; jeans 💫 Bella, Blanca or Emily?</p> <p>A post shared by @heartoffandoms on Oct 29, 2017 at 7:27pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>You can take a secret pride in knowing that bustier girls cannot rock cropped tops as much as we less endowed girls can. Bigger boobs will cause the cropped tee or top to stretch in places it shouldn’t, would show too much skin than it is supposed to (not always a good thing, make a note ladies), might flash an underboob (when not planned, yikes!) and could just hang way in front of the body than it is supposed to. For flat chested girls, crop tops accent all the right bits and can bring attention to the chest with its swaying form. You can pair these with short shorts, leather skirt, pants and a blazer or sweater. You can go I-have-spent-the-day-in-bed casual with them as well as this-is-my-Paris-fashion-week-inspired-semi-formal look. Let that imagination run wild.</p> <h2>10. Backless, backless, backless</h2>      <p> La Perla at the Met</p> <p>A post shared by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on May 2, 2017 at 8:28am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Party in the back, ya’ll! Everyone knows going backless with small boobs is much less of a hassle and an easier look to pull off than with big boobs. You can’t wear a bra which means the action in the front has to be carefully ‘monitored’. With small boobs you don’t have to worry about any action in the front (because there isn’t any, sorry!) and going backless is easier. It is a very high fashion look and will definitely turn a few dozen heads your way.</p>     <h2>9. Low V necks and plunging necklines</h2>      <p> October 23: #KendallJenner heading to an event in NYC. @KendallJenner wore @redemptionofficial #Fall2017 'Long Sleeve Wrap Front Metallic Dress' ($2,595). 🌹</p> <p>A post shared by Kendall Jenner Closet (@kendalljennercloset) on Oct 24, 2017 at 11:08am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Some people believe that only women who have a curvy figure and busty chest can really look good in such necklines. This is because they have the cleavage to work it and who doesn’t like flaunting what they have. They give a very sexy, seductive almost provocative look. But at the same time, flat chested girls can also really own these plunging necklines and deep V cuts without giving the sultry, seductive look that the busty girls can. They can wear it casually without baring their cleavage and give a very casual, boho-chic vibe. Plunging necklines are also your go-to evening wear and you wouldn’t have to worry about the hassle of a bra (and again controlling that action in the front). With a little tape to secure the V cut your small boobs will ensure there is no boob slippage or that dreaded nip-slip. Be the belle of the ball!</p> <h2>8. Long necklaces</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2170.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>With the chokers all the rage these days, long necklaces have taken somewhat of a backseat. It is harder for bustier women to pull off these as the necklace just ends up sinking and getting stuck in their cleavage. But if you are a flat-chested girl who wants to rock a deep V cut or a plunging neckline, think about accessorizing with long necklaces. They add a bit of flair to the personality and also fall flatly over the skin which is quite aesthetically pleasing.</p> <h2>7. Ruffles and frills</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2171.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>Your flat chest is canvas that is just calling to be painted (not literally) and texturized. With bows, ruffles, frills, giant embellishments and add-on fixtures you can give your overall look a lot of dimension. It makes your chest area looks busy, bold and distracts from the fact that there isn’t much of a distraction up there. Big bosoms can’t handle all that fun going on because they don’t want too much going on. For flat girls, ruffles and frills add volume and are a very fun look that they can easily pull off.</p> <h2>6. Side boob</h2>      <p> thank you for last night @calvinklein @costafrancisco @esteelauder</p> <p>A post shared by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on May 5, 2015 at 9:17am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Side boob is the new cleavage and we love it. Whether you are an A-cup of a DD, revealing sides and side boobs are a trend you can look hot in. With busty girls, there is a lot of caution and preparation required from securing sides with tape and other measures to make sure there is no unwarranted action and unwanted spillage. For flat girls, there is no need to worry about accidental exposure and they can look classy without showing too much side boobs and making the outfit look disproportionate.</p> <h2>5. Stripes</h2>      <p> Stripes anyone? ⛵️</p> <p>A post shared by Emma Roberts (@emmaroberts) on Aug 30, 2015 at 10:25am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>There is a reason a lot of optical illusions make use of stripes. Stripes are known for making you look wider which is why these area strict no-no for bustier women. For flat chested girls, these can make the chest look bigger in just an instant. Whether the lines are vertical or horizontal, they get stretched out giving the illusion of a curvier figure and really help accentuate a flat chest.</p> <h2>4. Off-shoulder tops</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2172.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>Fun, flirty and totally not boring off-shoulder tops are everywhere these days. Meant to put more focus on the shoulders, collarbone and the neck you’d be stealing the show with your boobs if you are a busty girl wearing an off-shoulder. For flat girls, these tops bring out other notable features of their bodice and take attention away from a non-existent bust.</p> <h2>3. High necklines and halter tops</h2>      <p> Sun sun sun! ☀️</p> <p>A post shared by Perrie Edwards ✌️🌻 (@perrieedwards) on Jan 12, 2016 at 4:10am PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Just like off-shoulder tops, halter tops and high necks are meant to accentuate shoulders and arms. Technically, high necks give the illusion of a busty chest and are perfect of girls with small boobs. These show skin and take focus away from a flat chest with nothing much going on. Halter tops aren’t too overwhelming a look when you have small boobs as compared to girls with a bigger chest. Again, flat girls can pull off a halter top easily with no bra underneath. Busty girls find halter tops and high necks harder to pull off as the fabric gets stretched and the boobs are right there in everyone’s face.</p> <h2>2. Cut outs</h2>      <p> Heading back to La Jolla this weekend for a very exciting project I can’t wait to shareeeee!!!! 💃🏼🌺 🌊 #lajolla #sandiego</p> <p>A post shared by Taylor Love|Love Inside &amp; Out (@taylor_lovee) on Oct 26, 2017 at 1:23pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>All the rage these days, cut out dresses and tops come in a variety of designs and styles. There can be shapes cut out at the sides, on the front, in the back, over the chest and under it. There might be bows holding cut outs together or razor-thin strips of fabric. For busty girls, there is a serious threat of things slipping and stuff spilling. Flat girls can hold ‘things’ together easily and find this look easier to manage and pull off.</p> <h2>1. Bandeaus</h2>      <p> new @maxmara by the legendary #stevenmeisel @carineroitfeld @patmcgrathreal @guidopalau 🙏🏼🖤 #ad</p> <p>A post shared by Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid) on Feb 13, 2017 at 4:23pm PST</p>   <p></p>     <p>Before bralettes were all the rage, bandeaus were quietly and successfully replacing bras. But not as much for bustier girls as these cannot provide as much support as a bra or even bralette can. There is always the threat of the boobs sagging (not a very flattering look) and the bandeau slipping (the horror!). These are more attractive on flat girls as they do not get stretched and pulled over the chest and are comfortable to wear as well. You can wear them as is on a hot summer day or pair them with a see-through dress, a lacy top or a buttoned down shirt. The options are limitless.</p>   <i></i>
