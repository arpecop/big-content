It’s like you saw something lifeless come to life, seems pretty impossible right? what if those are just illusions? Entering into the illusory dimension and indulging in it soo much that you admit its reality. Haha was just trying to be philosophical, that is how these magic tricks seem; Philosophical.</p> <p>Magic is mostly termed as street magic or the street one. There is a difference between the paranormal magic and those performed on streets by pretty common folks who may seem invincible to us but we forget the fact if they really were invincible they wouldn’t have been performing on the streets just for some bucks right? Well, let’s not get into that detail because that’s kind of unrelated to what we’re going to discuss.</p> <h2>Inception of magical tricks</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2166-0a-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>However, where and when was this word ‘Magic’ coined? If we ponder on the history it would seem more amazing and would stir curiosity because we do know what is magic but aren’t familiar with its root and the skeletal. The word ‘Magic’ was first coined by the Greeks. Its roots are related to the term which the Greeks used ‘mageia’. Now how did this word form, actually the humongous Persian and Greek empires were at duel with each other for really stretched periods of time and amidst that, there were Persian priests who were called ‘magosh’ in Persian. They were termed as ‘mageia’ by the Greeks and their practices/rituals were known as ‘magika’, now does it sound familiar? Yes, it does. Magika and Magic. Now talking about the magical stunts and tricks, they were discovered in 1584 scripted in a book. By pondering on that first scripture, more and more copies were made in the 17th century and till the 18th century, magic flourished worldwide as a common practice done by the entertainers to stimulate curiosity in the common-folks, royals and every native there. This became mainstream and people really thought these tricks were for real and can be executed just by the ‘Magicians’. I’ll call magicians as a sacred order in those times because they were not more in numbers so they were outliers.</p> <h2>Into the Limelight</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2166-0b-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>How magic came into the fold of entertainment? The credit goes to a man named Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin, who had a theatre in Paris only meant for magical practices. The time period was on 1845. Abreast of him, there was an individual in Great Britain specifically in London named John Henry Anderson who was also introducing the same practice which was taking Paris entertainment in its fold. Till the dead end of the 19th century, magic engulfed some big theatres and it was inexorable.</p> <h2>Magical Stunts</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2166-0c-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>This can differ from magician to magician. As paintings can vary from painter to painter because there are a plethora of ways to paint, Paintbrush, pencil etc. That is how magic differs as well. Numerous categories have come into the spotlight which is being utilized by magical artists all over the globe. Some magicians can turn a red handkerchief into a blue one, some can pull of pigeons out of their hats and some can tear the body into two halves in two separate boxes, going into one closet and leaving the other one placed with the former one and much more. As I said it’s all about the artist and the mediums they pick up to entertain the audience on the stage.</p> <p>Until the 18th century, many tricks were introduced into the magical market, these included fire breathing, juggling some pieces of solid objects and swallowing the sword (which I find quite fascinating and scary). I mean how did they swallow the whole of the sword without cutting their internal organs, haha, just trying to ponder on the phenomena. Yes, this is what I was talking about, illusions and the illusory atmosphere there can eventually make you have faith in every act they commit and you are just startled.</p> <h2>Ads</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2166-0d-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>One renowned individual in the 18th century named Isaac Fawkes even advertised his magical acts and he even claimed to perform in front of the ruling monarch King George II. I’ll narrate his advertisement which was scripted on the paper because of the absence of mainstream media like nowadays, E-Media.</p> <p><strong>“The magician takes an empty bag, places it on the table and turns it various times inside out, by then his empty bag pours out several showers of Gold and Silver which is real, 100 eggs and after that his bag bloats up and throws out several birds out of it ……” </strong>and that is how his advertisement narrated his phenomenal magic skills.</p> <h2>Categories to the art</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2166-1-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>As I talked about the several types of magical tricks and forms, there are categories to it which several magicians described. There also have been disagreements to these categories because every artist claims their art/form to be the prevalent one but let’s describe some of them.</p> <h2>1. Vanish</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2166-2-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>As the word sounds, vanishing. This technique is a mirror to the other category ‘Production’ which I’ll be describing below. In vanishing, the magician vanishes something in his hands like a coin, their assistants or some pigeons or maybe disappearing themselves in the closet as well.</p> <h2>2. Production</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2166-3-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Just as I said, a mirror to the vanishing it means producing something or incarnating something with magical stunts. Taking out a rabbit from the hat or appearing with a puff smoke, NO not you, the MAGICIAN!</p>     <h2>3. Transformation</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2166-4-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>The transition of a subject into something else. Changing its aspects or properties which can be the color or totally altering someone into something different from the basic nature. Like changing the color of the handkerchiefs into other vibrances or changing a human into an animal. WHOOPS! The last one sounds really odd and impossible and I am not ready to believe it even in the show.</p> <h2>4. Restoration</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2166-4b-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Restoring something, which the magician, has experimented on, is restoration. Smashing something and re-incarnating it, changing the handkerchief into its original state or turning the assistant who has been cut into halves into full embodiment once again.</p> <h2>Magic Tricks which can be learned by anyone</h2> <p>Now we’ll talk about the tricks which can be learned by anyone of you. Usually, magicians don’t reveal their tricks to common folks like us due to several reasons. But to me, it’s their monopoly which can be disturbed if the tricks disclosed too openly. But I can be wrong here. Anyways this isn’t my domain to ponder upon haha but I’ll let you know what are those already disclosed magical tricks introduced by estranged magicians or maybe they wanted to make the world aware of these illusions.</p> <h2>1. Diving bell</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2166-tricks-1-jpg.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Do you want to be recognized as the water wizard or a maestro who can throw anything into the water without getting get wet, there is something for you lads and lassies. You can try this simple trick at home or anywhere you want but you got to have some instruments/kit for this one. Your equipment will include Water Glass, Paper, and a small Tub full of water. Next what you will do is to fold the paper and make it smaller. Get its corners stuck in the bottom of the glass and soak the glass upside down in the water tub. Voila, the paper wouldn’t be wet if you take it out after this. The reason to this is that when you fold the paper and make its corners touch the bottom of the glass, the air gets stuck into that hence refraining the water to touch the paper. Pretty Simple!</p> <h2>2. Invisible Ink</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2166-tricks-2-jpg.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You must have encountered the MAGICAL INK. The ink which is invisible but comes to life because of something the magicians executes. It’s pretty cool to try no? sending secret messages to your best friend or beau without noticing it. Well, it’s possible. You just need a paintbrush, lemon juice, paper and source of heating. Soak the brush in the lemon juice and write down anything on the paper with it. Then put hot iron and press it a bit. It would burn the ink which would resurface on the paper. Here you go, your concealed message.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2166-tricks-2a-jpg.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <h2>3. The needle</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2166-tricks-3-jpg.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Ever wondered how those magicians don’t let the needle drown in the water? It seems as if the needle is swimming in the water with the fact that the needle is more denser than the water and it should sink according to the laws of science. The trick is quite simple. Here is what you can do to not let the needle sink and make it float on the water. You’ll need a needle, plucker, glass with some little amount of grease or oil and a glass full of water. Soak the needle in the oily matter with the help of the plucker and then do the same by placing the needle in the glass of water. You’ll be astonished to see that the needle would be floating on the surface. Why is that? The greasy matter creates a surrounding around the needle and air is entrapped with it. In the outcome, the air refrains the needle from sinking.</p> <h2>4. Telekinesis</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2166-tricks-5-jpg.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Ever wanted to move things with the power of your thoughts? Well, say no more. You just need a big water bottle with a little pack of sauce/ketchup. Place the pack in the water and move one of your hand to the bottom of the bottle and the other should be away to depict as if you’re moving the packet of sauce in the</p> <p>water with telekinesis. Press the bottom of the bottle with the other hand slightly to move the packet down and let it free to make the packet go up. This is how you can ultimately balance the sauce pack in the middle with getting your audience cheer up for you.</p> <h2>5. Disappearing the finger</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2166-tricks-6a-jpg.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Well, this one’s not that much exceptional but you try it for the little ones. All you need are your five fingers. By sliding your other hand over the magical hand, hide one of your finger behind the other and place back the other hand to its original position. There you go little ones, my finger’s gone forever.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2166-tricks-6b-jpg.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com     <p>Here you’ve most of the tricks used by those magicians.
