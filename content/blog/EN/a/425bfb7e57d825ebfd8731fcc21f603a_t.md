Goals give you an aim to work towards, making your life more productive and thus, giving i meaning. If you don’t work towards something, it can be very easy to lose sense of purpose, and spiral into feeling meaningless. Everybody needs a direction for guidance and small goals help you create just that.</p> <h2>18. Other people’s opinions don’t matter</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-806.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If you spend your life trying to please other people, chances are that you will never really have enough time to do anything that pleases you. Nowadays, there is immense pressure on everyone to be liked by all the people that surround them. In trying to make ourselves more likeable, we end up losing all that makes us unique.</p> <h2>17. We can’t control everything</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-807.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>A lot of us go through the anxiety and stress in trying to be on top of everything that goes on around us. We want everything to be accommodated exactly according to our needs, however that is impossible. In most cases, it is impossible to control all that is going on around us. In fact, external factors come later, we can’t even control our own bodies.</p> <h2>16. Failure is inevitable</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-808.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>No one can have a life that is centered solely on success. A happy life is one in which you put yourself out there to the all the possibilities of success that life has to offer. In doing so, you also open yourself up to the possibility of failing in your endeavors. However, if we are honest, failure often teaches us more valuable lessons than success ever could.</p> <h2>15. Possessions mean nothing</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-809.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Running after material possessions is futile. Expensive clothes, luxury cars and branded bags, while might provide you with temporary happiness, mean nothing in the long run. On the other hand, relationships are more meaningful and stay valid for longer. So instead of running after material possessions, spend time investing in worthwhile people, and reap the benefits of a good and supportive social circle.</p> <h2>14. Thinking about doing something is not the same as actually doing it</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-810.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Thinking about things, while might make for great daydreaming, is not going to get you anywhere. If there are no actions involved, only thinking about things will not make them happen. Success will not find you and automatically pick you for the great things you assume you’re destined for. In fact, you need to chase after your goals and dreams if you want them to become a reality.</p> <h2>13. Change is unavoidable</h2> <p><img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-811.jpeg"/></p> <p>https://www.shutterstock.com/es/image-photo/change-concept-509115214?src=zMDyszJwKtfZ0ltK0c0aMQ-1-16</p> <p>Shutterstock.com</p> <p>Change is the only constant in life that you can count on. While most of us are used to how things are, making us abhor change, we need to realize that it is an essential part of our emotional growth. No matter how hard we resist it, change cannot be avoided for long. It is better to make the best of what you have, while continuing to accept that life goes on.</p> <h2>12. You can’t count on anyone but yourself</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-813.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>You are the only person who is working solely for your own personal interests, Other people, while might want what’s good for you, will only keep wanting so as long as it doesn’t intersect with their needs. As soon as you need something that compromises someone else’s happiness even in the least, rest assured that they will value their own priorities above your happiness. Don’t let this sadden you. In fact, use this information to build yourself up as someone you can truly depend on.</p> <h2>11. The people you surround yourself with have the power to make or break you</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-815.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The people you surround yourself with have a great impact on your general wellbeing as a person. If the people around you are positive and encouraging, constantly pushing you to be the best that you can, chances are that you will thrive in their company. On the other hand, if you are surrounded by people who keep pushing you down, you will find it hard to have faith in your abilities, Thus, choose your company wisely.</p> <h2>10. Your life will never be perfect</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-817.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If you keep trying for your life to be perfect, chances are you will never be thankful of what you have right now. Everyone wants a bigger house, a better car, a more loving partner. While being aspirational is admirable, if it interferes with your current level of happiness, it only ends up meaning that you will never live in the present, making you take everything that you currently have for granted. Take a look around and be thankful for what you have, while continuing to work for what you want.</p>     <h2>9. Your attitude means everything</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-819.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>How you view your life affects how your life really is. If you make an effort to be happy and content, chances are that you will find your life to be great. However, if you keep focusing on the negatives, your life will start seeming dreary.</p> <h2>8. You alone have the power to change how your life is</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-821.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>There is no need to look here and there when it comes to making decisions about your life. You alone have what it takes to take your life in the right direction. Depending on other people to make your decisions or positively influence your life would be to cripple your own capabilities. Instead of looking to other people to fix your life for you, work on giving yourself the tools to create a positive impact on your life. After all, you are your biggest asset.</p> <h2>7. Fear is the top most source of regret</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-823.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Being afraid of things is what hinders most people’s progress into the world. People are so scared of failure that they end up never going after what they really want. However, what they don’t realize is that in letting fear stop them from going after what they want, they are creating a source of deep regret for themselves. So the next time you feel scared of going after something you want based on the fear of failure, remind yourself that while failing feels bad, regret feels worse.</p> <h2>6. Having people like you is inconsequential</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-825.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Most of us spend our whole lives trying to impress people who could not care less about us. We bend over backwards, getting new things and pretending to be someone we’re not in a vain attempt to impress complete strangers. What we forget is that what people say or think about us has no affect on our lives as long as we don’t give them the power to do so. Self-esteem plays a vital role in the fulfillment of this. In order to be comfortable with people not approving of everything you do, you need to be free from the need to seek validation from external sources. That only comes to someone who is content and happy with who they are and don’t need other people’s approval to survive.</p> <h2>5. You are your biggest asset</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-827.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>We spend so much time investing in other people that we forget that in reality, we are the only person we really need. We don’t realize that investing in other people is taking away from the time that we can spend bettering ourselves. Instead of trying to please people who won’t even be there to catch you when you fall, start spending time getting to know yourself. Build up your strengths and work on your flaws. Being the best version of yourself is the only way to be truly successful in this world.</p> <h2>4. You can’t change what you don’t confront</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-828.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>People are so scared of change that they often run in the opposite direction whenever they sense it coming. While difficult to process and adjust to, change is inevitably good for you. However, in order to see a positive change within yourself, you need to first see what needs bettering. Whether you need to inculcate new habits, or improve upon something you already have can only be found via thorough self-evaluation. So take the time out and get to know yourself better. When you know yourself inside out, you can initiate the process of change, making your life evolve for the better.</p> <h2>3. Focusing on your problems won’t get you anywhere</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-829.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Most of us spend our days worrying about one thing or another. We stress about all that has happened, is happening or you fear might happen. This does not only make you ruin your present, but you also taint your future with all the overthinking. Instead of fixating on everything that you deem wrong with your life, you should instead direct all your energies towards looking for solutions. If you try to look for answers, rather than just spend your days worrying about impending problems, your life will start to look a lot better.</p> <h2>2. What you get might not be what you want, but it will be what you need</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-830.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>All of us have a set picture of how our life is supposed to turn out. We spend so much time fixating on how things are supposed to be that we forget to appreciate what we really have. Instead of running after all that you think you need and desire, try to acknowledge and appreciate all that you have been endowed with. Rest assured, what is for you will find its way to you through anything. The universe has a way of handing you exactly what you need even if you didn’t know you needed it in the first place.</p> <h2>1. Nothing is constant</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-831.jpeg"/>Shutterstock     <p>In this world, nothing is a sure constant, everything from people to material possessions can disappear in the blink of an eye. Realizing this you need to try your best to value what you have, before you lose it forever.</p>   <i></i>
