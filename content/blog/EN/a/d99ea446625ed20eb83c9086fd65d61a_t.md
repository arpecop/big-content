This mysterious world is full of secrets that are waiting to be deciphered. Though we hear about new discoveries and findings every now and then, there are still some mysterious happenings and secrets that are yet to be uncovered. These secrets might stay as they are, with no one being able to really grasp the real logic of its happening. It is that their keepers took away the keys to opening the box of Pandora which lies in their minds as merely a thought. These thoughts have made people eager to dig out to the roots of it but no one yet had them figure out.</p> <p>Following are a few of these nerve-wracking secrets that will surely get you thinking about them for a while and will make you ask yourself “What is the actual story behind it? “Put some thought into them and let’s see if you may be able to develop a sense out of them.</p> <h2>Queen-Bohemian Rhapsody.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1928.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Bohemian Rhapsody is a song with several sections sung by the most popular band named “Queen”. It was written by Freddy Mercury, for the band. It became commercially a success staying as it made to the top of the list of UK Singles chart for about nine weeks. This song was considered a bit strange due to Freddy’s intense dubbing to create its sound and also it was without any chorus.</p> <p>The actual meaning of the song is also ambiguous as it was made that way by Freddie and according to a few people, Freddie wrapped his personal life in the lyrics of the song like his being forced out of the Zanzibar or like his relationship. But now with him gone this would stay a mystery to the people. However, even with its strange lyrics and mysterious writing, people still enjoy it a lot and it became one of the most popular songs, not just of the 20th century but also of 21st century too.</p> <h2>The Neolithic Stone, Bosnia.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1929.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>A renowned archaeologist “ Semir Osmanagich”, also known as “Bosnian Indiana Jones” discovered a huge ball of about 3 meters width in Bosnia. It is believed by Semir that it belongs to an ancient civilization of about 1500 Years ago who used to possess the advanced technology. Its reddish appearance is what describes its relation to the ancient civilization.</p> <p>However, every discovery comes with a few objections and raised eyebrows about the true reality of the subject under question. Few scientists believe that the stone is not actually a wonder of civilization but a naturally occurring ball of iron called a “Concretion” and due to its richness in iron it took a reddish color.</p> <p>To some people, it seems like a once advanced technology while to others it is a wonder to a human about how beautiful nature can be. But “What exactly is it?” this will remain a mystery to us.</p> <h2>Starlite.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1930.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Maurice Ward was an amateur chemist, inventor and a hairdresser who once noticed a plane burst into flames. As air has particles that rub constantly through the walls of aircraft, the aircrafts catch fire due to friction. Seeing this he decided to invent such a material that could withstand high temperatures. As they say, if you want something from the core of your heart, universe helps you get that. He succeeded in his attempt and invented such material. He called it “Starlite”.</p> <p>Starlite could withstand temperatures of about 18000 Fahrenheit. Even a blow torch towards an egg covered with Starlite couldn’t do anything to the egg. The word was out and this invention soon covered the top news around the world. The government was interested in such an invention but Maurice was reluctant to sell. He wasn’t so easy to give it up and was impossible to deal with as he would keep changing the prices. NASA, Boeing, and even British Dept. of defense offered him but he wouldn’t.</p> <p>“What was that material made of?” Nobody would possibly ever know as the recipe of Starlite died with him.</p> <h2>Lake Winnipesaukee Mystery stone.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1931.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Discovered in 1872 by the workers, digging a hole for a fence in Meredith, New Hampshire, a rock was found which was not an ordinary one. It’s Stone Age, origin and purpose are still unknown even after about a century of its discovery. This stone is completely made of quartz and what makes it special is its strange yet beautiful carvings which seem to be done quite carefully.</p>     <p>This 4 inches long and 2.5 inches thick egg-shaped rock has a hole drilled in it from top to bottom. In 1994, a bore scope analyst Richard Boisvert suggested that the hole seems to have been drilled by 19th or 20th-century power tools as the hole was regular throughout even though it should have been the other way around for something that was a few centuries old.</p> <p>From when or where does this rock come from? It is still a mystery as this kind quartz has never been found in such an area.</p> <h2>The Three Secrets of Fatima</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1932.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Between May and October 1917, during the apparitions of Fatima, the Virgin Mary gave visions to three Portuguese shepherds Lucia, Jacinta, and Francisco. These three visions were actually prophetic and apocalyptic. The kids were shocked by the sight of these dreams and it was hard for them to forget.</p> <p>The first vision was of hell. After which they prayed intensely for the conversion of sinners as they saw the sinners in the sea of fire, crying with pain and trembling with fear.</p> <p>The second vision was prophetic which suggested men to stop offending God there will be a huge war. And it was the vision of World War 2.</p> <p>The third secret was according to some people, never actually revealed. But when Lucia fell ill and about to reach the end of her life, she wrote a letter to father at his request and told him to never open it until 1960. It was revealed by Pope John Paul in 2000. However, it wasn’t actually considered to be the 3rd secret as Sister Lucia was forbidden by Virgin Mary to reveal the secrets and what we are considering to be the third secret might just be what Sister Lucia has written to satisfy the priest.</p> <h2>Mysterious Sound</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1933.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>In Taos, New Mexico, there have been encounters with people who claimed to have heard a mysterious hum around the town. The source of the hum is unknown and unexplainable, but different people give this hum different colors. Few say this is just environmental while others say in Taos, a psychological experiment to mess with people’s head is being carried out. The hum is actually not that common and only a tiny portion of the town’s population has heard the hum. But no conclusive evidence to support the presence of the hum has been found and it will remain a mystery until then.</p> <h2>Secret Recipe.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1934.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Colonel Sanders KFC is one of the most popular fried chicken restaurant. There is a hard struggling story behind the KFC as we know. But what makes the chicken so delicious? The recipe of it’s fried chicken is one of the most heavily guarded secrets. Although this secret recipe seems to have been cracked open when his nephew revealed his wife’s last will, still Sanders’ family insist that this is not the actual recipe.</p> <p>Real or not the answer has been buried with him and it will remain that way unless Sanders come back to life to testify.</p> <h2>Bermuda Triangle</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1935.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>You might probably have heard of Bermuda Triangle or Devil’s Triangle. It is a roughly defined area in the North Atlantic Ocean. It is called triangle as the region is located roughly among three points that are Florida, Puerto Rico and Bermuda. It is the area where a lot of aircrafts and ships have mysteriously disappeared. Few people who claim to have survived being there say that compasses do not show North in that region. But anything that goes inside that region almost get lost or destructed in there.</p> <p>Some people say it is an area possessed by the Aliens while others say it is Government experiment location, but since no one can tell the tale of what exactly is happening in there, it is hard to speculate. A few people who say to have entered to the region by mistake, they cannot really explain their feelings besides a weird and creepy one. The only things they noticed and are common are the compasses not showing any directions, clouds covering sky on a normal sunny day and losing the track of the time like being thrown in a time loop.</p>     <p>But what is happening in there actually, will remain an unexplainable mystery.</p>   <i></i>
