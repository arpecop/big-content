         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -1<p>There are very few people in the Western world who are not familiar with the works of Disney. Fans all over the globe dream of going to Disneyland. However, there is another aspect to the lessons and characters portrayed in Disney movies.</p> <p>Those interesting in the workings of the human psyche would know how certain syndromes are popularly named after Disney characters. If you don’t, it’s worth reading about these syndromes below</p> <p>The above syndromes may have official scientific names, but attributing them to Disney characters serves some functions. If nothing else, it helps us to make sense of how people can have problematic ways of thinking. We may want to reconsider which movies are really suitable for children to watch, though.</p> <h2>10. Cinderella Complex No. 1</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1054.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Cinderella is no doubt one of the most popular Disney characters to date. However, she is also the epitome of complete dependence upon the kindness of others. Hence, there are some women with a Cinderella complex, which basically makes them fear autonomy. Such women may go through life just wanting someone to take care of their every need instead of fending for themselves.</p> <p>Needless to say, such a syndrome does not bode well for an adult lady. However, women have traditionally been bound to one man or another throughout history. Now that the modern woman is relatively free to live her own life, many find that they just can’t. They would rather stay at home and exude Cinderella-like qualities such as kindness, housekeeping, and utter politeness.</p> <p>In this day and age, and in any other, this tactic only works to give men all the power. And since few men are angels, this leads to women being trapped in abusive relationships. The sad part is that those with Cinderella syndrome are actually capable of helping themselves.</p> <h2>9. Never Growing Up</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1055.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>We all cherish the memories of our golden days. However, those with the Peter Pan syndrome take things a little further. People like these are rarely motivated to work and function as adults. Hence, they are unable to form adult bonds or focus on mastering any skill.</p> <p>This syndrome also causes people to just focus on huge, unrealistic dreams they had as children. However, they are incapable of putting in the work it takes to become a famous celebrity, for example. When they inevitably fail in their dreams, such individuals would seek to blame anyone but themselves. They would hence point fingers at their spouses, families, or employers. They are also likely to get depressed and turn to drug and substance abuse to numb their feelings.</p> <h2>8. Sleeping Life Away</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1056.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Afternoon naps are lovely, but not if they stretch for hours. Sleep Beauty may be fine with sleeping for a hundred years. However, Sleeping Beauty Syndrome is actually a very disturbing sleep disorder. There are very few documented cases, and every sufferer seems to have a different experience.</p> <p>However, one woman reported that she was only able to stay awake long enough to feed herself and visit the bathroom. Other than that, her life was unlivable for about five whole months. Even when she was awake, she was not fully alert. This is not surprising, since we take some time to get our bearings after a long nap. However, real-life sleeping beauties may not be able to be conscious for that long.</p> <h2>7. Just Being a Princess</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1057.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Classic princess movies are huge cash cows for Disney. However, they sometimes have a very negative impact on how their young audiences start viewing life. Some little girls, especially, could grow up thinking that a fairy tale life is the best one to live. They are hence obsessed with looks, dresses, makeup, and find it difficult to think of anything else.</p> <p>In fact, society is to blame for glamorizing the lives of processes so very much. In reality, not even actual princesses have a perfect life. Still, Disney seems to have taught many females that they cannot be happy on their own. They may hence just wait for someone to save them. With their interest in looks and materialistic objects, they may also come across as narcissistic and feather-brained.</p> <h2>6. Consuming Envy</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1058.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>The Snow White Syndrome is one that revolves around one’s own envy and the perceived envy of other people. As psychotherapist Betsy Cohen puts it, those suffering from this condition are always afraid of being envied. They may hence not be happy with the things they have acquired. On the other hand, they themselves routinely envy others for what they have.</p>     <p>This reasoning may not seem logical, but it makes sense in a way. Snow White was the most beautiful in the land, and she went through a lot of suffering. Hence, some women with this syndrome may deliberately wreck their beauty instead of supposedly competing with other beauties.</p> <h2>5. The Effect of Bambi</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1059.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>The Bambi Complex is actually quite a nice and sweet one. After the movie’s release, many people started sympathizing with woodland and wild creatures. There was also a surge in the opposition to hunters and their activities.</p> <p>People with a Bambi complex would go out of their way to take care of and protect innocent creatures. They would also be staunchly against anything that could hurt wild animals, such as controlled fires, hunting, and deforestation. In fact, the impact of this cartoon movie was so strong that even hunting association and sportsmen could redeem themselves.</p> <h2>4. Two Kinds of Ugly Ducklings</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1060.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>The Ugly Duckling is a lesser-known short Disney film, but everyone knows how the story goes. An ugly duckling gets pushed around for looking different. Eventually, it grows up to be the most beautiful swan ever.</p> <p>Those suffering from this syndrome just don’t feel like they fit in anywhere. They may have different passions or a different style of clothing. In any case, they would usually hide away and never realize their full potential. If courage and supported, however, they could blossom into something truly special.</p> <p>Another form of this syndrome occurs when a plain child grows up to be a physically attractive person. They may not realize or accept their adult beauty. In fact, they may even shun affection and love, thinking they can’t truly deserve it.</p> <h2>3. A Mission to Change</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1061.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>There have been several objections to making ‘Beauty and the Beast’ a romance. A man who is cruel enough to imprison a girl should not be redeemed by the girl’s kindness. Unfortunately, many modern women find themselves caught by the Beauty and the Beast syndrome.</p> <p>This is when females stick with abusive and irrational partners. The women think they can manage to change their partners. Of course, this cannot happen unless the abuser wants to change on their own.</p> <h2>2. Cinderella Complex No. 2 and More</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1062.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>There are actually several complexes known as the Cinderella complex. One is when a woman is constantly looking for that perfect Prince Charming. No man can be as perfect as a cartoon prince, though, so these women rarely find anyone to match their requirements. They may turn away great guys who are sincere and genuine. As a result, these women often end up alone for the rest of their lives in spite of craving companionship.</p> <p>Another syndrome is a sort of reversal. The person feels that any partner is a savior, no matter how terrible or abusive they are. They may hence fall in ‘love’ way too quickly and try to take things quicker than most would find comfortable. They would thus drive away many a decent man from their lives.</p> <h2>1. Hair That Kills</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1063.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>This syndrome is probably the worst of the bunch, being the most dangerous. In England, a sixteen-year-old girl passed away due to eating her own hair. This is what is known as the Rapunzel Syndrome. The habit of consuming one’s own hair is a rare one and could be life-threatening. This particular case ended in tragedy.</p>     <p>The result of the peculiar dietary habit was a huge hairball that inflamed the lining of the girl’s stomach. This inflammation is also known as peritonitis and makes the body’s organs stop working. If not that, too much hair in the stomach could cause an ulcer. This may pierce the abdomen. The best cure here, if a case is diagnosed in time, is to remove the hair surgically. After that, the patient should definitely seek psychological assistance.</p>   <i></i>
