People are trying to get in the Christmas spirit. Every year people try to make their Christmas special for themselves and people around them. Once people adopt pets, they become a part of the household and become a family member.</p> <p>Then some owners take special care in making occasions like Christmas and Thanksgiving festive for their pets just as they make it festive for their other family members. Generally, dog lovers go a step further. Same was the case with this couple who did a photoshop for their dog. Often stories go viral of insanely cute dogs and their tricks. However, this dog story is a little different. It‚Äôs about an angry Husky. This Siberian Husky has garnered fame for his grumpy facial expressions attributable to a dark black mask on the face.</p> <h2>Angry Husky</h2> <p>To find out more about the dog, the owner, Jasmine Milton, was interviewed by famous online website. Milton said that he it‚Äôs the marking and the colour of the fur on his face that gives him an angry look. He has blueish grey eyes that pop in contrast with his black and white fur. He is a Siberian Husky which is a snow breed, recognizable by their thick fur coat, erect ears and distinctive markings. The owner has named him Anuko. Anuko is described as a fun and a chilled-out dog. He is quite the opposite of what he looks. Although he is not very fond of cuddling, but he follows Jasmine everywhere. She claims that this has given her the feeling of companionship something has helped her a lot regarding her mental health.</p> <h2>Struggling with mental health</h2> <p>The story behind how she got Anuko is an emotional one. Jasmine had been struggling with mental where she encountered the suggestion to adopt a dog.</p> <p>To fight depression it‚Äôs important to laugh, exercise and love. All of which release a chemical called Serotonin in our brains. Serotonin is a feel-good chemical that helps fight with the feelings of anxiety and depression. Dogs are affectionate and buying one to match one‚Äôs own personality can really help. Additionally, dogs require a schedule which the owner must follow. This helps get exercise even when you might not feel like doing it.</p> <p>Having a pet helps people emotionally and keeps them busy. A dog gives unconditionally love. They force you to get outside and play with them. A research study by ‚ÄòHuman-Animal Bond Research Institute‚Äô says that 74% of the people surveyed claimed that having a pet improved their mental health.</p> <p>Jasmine had been hearing similar advice when she decided to implement the decision and get a dog for herself. Anuko was only 5 weeks old when she adopted him. Ever since they‚Äôve been inseparable. Jasmine said that she was depressed to the point where she had gotten suicidal. She had even quit school and as a result did not have an extended social circle. As many people going through depression tell, she spent most of her time in bed. Anuko encouraged her to enjoy the outdoors and get active. It gave her feeling of love and companionship.</p> <h2>Snowdog guru</h2> <p>A lot of times people who are suffering do not find a source of happiness that keeps them afloat. With Jasmine and Anuko, they helped each other. Jasmine is now dedicated to helping owners take better care of their snow breed dogs. She runs a website called ‚ÄòSnowdog guru‚Äô. Where she helps other snow dog or northern breed owners. Anuko didn‚Äôt only help her with her mental state, she also inspired Jasmine to attend vet school. She attributes her finding her purpose in life to Anuko. Through her website and Facebook page she is now dedicated to helping other people take better care of their northern breeds. She blogs regularly on the website where the articles range from how to groom your dog to what to feed them. The Facebook page is dedicated to advices, tips and cute videos and pictures.</p> <p>This grumpy Christmas photoshop which is not grumpy at all, illustrates the bond Jasmine and Anuko share.</p> <h2>Christmas photoshoot</h2>      <p> Smile nunu üòÅ</p> <p>A post shared by  Anuko (@huskyanuko) on Dec 8, 2017 at 4:13am PST</p>   <p></p> <p>This picture was captioned, ‚ÄúSmile nunu‚Äù.</p>      <p> More snow here in the U.K. ‚ô•Ô∏è collar by @friendshipcollar</p> <p>A post shared by  Anuko (@huskyanuko) on Dec 10, 2017 at 5:24am PST</p>   <p></p>      <p> Merry Christmas‚Ä¶. or whatever</p> <p>A post shared by  Anuko (@huskyanuko) on Dec 11, 2017 at 10:53am PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Captioned, ‚ÄúMerry Christmas‚Ä¶. or whatever‚Äù.</p> <p>Indeed, Merry Christmas, but with a not so merry husky.</p>      <p> #celebratewithtaste for @edgardcooperuk!
