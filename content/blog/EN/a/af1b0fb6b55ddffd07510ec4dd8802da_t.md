If you aren't making babies with it, you can use this pro-creative energy to manifest the life you want. ⠀ ⠀ Did you know that the word &quot;libido&quot; has two definitions? ⠀ ⠀ 1) Your sex drive. ⠀ 2) The psychoanalytic definition: “The free, creative–or psychic—energy an individual has put toward personal development or individuation.” ~ Carl Jung⠀ ⠀ This is in line with my ideas on your sexual energy being your own, unique blueprint, When you are in touch with it, you are more yourself. Indeed, this energy is the very essence of you as an individual. ⠀ ⠀ The more you tap into it, the more you show up in your life in general. You become more of the person you were meant to be. Your work and vocation become more of a reflection of who you truly are. ⠀ ⠀ Turned-on genitals make good life and good art.⠀ ⠀ #thingsiliftwithmyvagina⠀ #vaginalkungfu⠀ #spain #barcelona #picasso #art #jadeeggs #yoniegg ⠀</p> <p>A post shared by Kim Anami (@kimanami) on Jan 28, 2017 at 12:24pm PST</p>   <p></p>      <p> #thingsiliftwithmyvagina The Morocco Series.
