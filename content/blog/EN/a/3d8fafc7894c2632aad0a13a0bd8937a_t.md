A man who can spend a long time in bed going at it without ejaculating is the highest standard of a strong sexual stamina. Long sessions between the sheets can help with eliminating the day’s stress and boosting pleasure which is exactly what a lot of people need.</p> <p>Sexual stamina or endurance is defined as how long a guy can last in bed and if he is unable to last as long as he wants then there are many reasons behind it. He could be experiencing early ejaculation, erectile dysfunction or may just not be up to it mentally and emotionally.</p> <h2>9. Get a physical</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-973.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>If you are concerned, go down to the local GP’s office and get a physical. Stamina has nothing to do with age or fitness. Sex isn’t as rigorous an activity as popular belief goes.</p> <p>In fact according to Dr. David R. Paolone, associate professor in Department of Urology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, ““Sexual intercourse is not as rigorous as men like to think that it is… From a cardiovascular standpoint, it’s really about the equivalent of going up two flights of stairs.” Let your doctor determine what’s really the problem at hand.</p> <h2>8. Take it slow in the bedroom</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-975.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>Start it off slow and keep your rhythm steady. Remember that it isn’t a marathon you’re running and there is no competition. It is just you and your partner looking forward to having a good time. Tease your partner by trying different things: switch the angle of penetration, vary between speed and depth and hold off just as you’re both about to come.</p> <h2>7. Change positions</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-977.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>Instead of jack-hammering your partner in a couple of positions throughout the sexual activity, switch between different positions as soon as you begin to draw closer to climax. The shift in speed, position and angle will help you last longer and the climax at the end will be more intense.</p> <h2>6. No harm in taking a break</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-978.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>Challenge yourself, with the agreement of your partner, to take a break as soon as things start to steam up. Hold off from penetrating them and go back to slowly kissing them, talking to them for a few seconds or oral sex. Start again once you feel the pending climax ebb away.</p>     <h2>5. Thicker condom</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-979.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>Using a thicker condom will reduce sensitivity and will help keep the orgasm at bay. Studies have shown that those men who use a condom and a lubricant both tend to last longer as it helps in reducing friction.</p> <h2>4. Take a look at what you are eating</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-980.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>Believe it or not, the food you put in your body has a great role to play in how long you last in bed. Avoid foods with high cholesterol and saturated fats. These can clog your arteries and cause constricted blood flow. A healthy, natural blood flow is vital to have a great time in bed.</p> <h2>3. Exercise</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-981.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>Regular exercise, aerobics and running for as little as ten minutes, five days a week will help build stamina to keep going in bed. Exercise will build a stronger, lasting endurance physically and will give you the energy as well as stamina to have great sex. As your body images improves, your self-esteem will get a boost and you will become a more confident lover.</p> <h2>2. Practice</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-982.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>They say practice makes perfect and it couldn’t be truer here. Have sex as frequently as possible with your partner while trying out all the above techniques. Another great (and fun) way of building your stamina is masturbation.</p> <p>As you get closer to orgasm, hold off and take a few seconds to inch away from it. Once you feel you can go on again, continue. Replicate this control when you are with your partner and you will see a major difference in how long you can go.</p> <h2>1. Leave stress at the door</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-983.jpeg"/>via shutterstock     <p>Don’t worry too much about what your partner thinks of your performance. Ask them if they would like anything different and then build up on their feedback. That way you will know that whatever you are doing, they are enjoying it as well.</p>   <i></i>
