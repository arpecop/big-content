Her story which was shared in a private chat group quickly went viral with more than 30,000 people sharing it.</p> <p>It has been over a decade since the disappearance and the case remains stubbornly unsolved as she has not been recovered and neither has her body been found.</p>      <p>A post shared by harriet ◕‿◕✿ (@harriet_brookes) on Nov 4, 2017 at 1:30pm PDT</p>       <p></p> <p>Harriet Brookes is not Madeline McCann for obvious for reasons for one if she were Madeline she would not be a freshman at university and would still be in school. Madeline if she is ever recovered is five years younger than Harriet Brookes.</p> <p>To clear the air however Harriet Brookes has said that she shared the post in a group and that it was meant to be just for fun and people have instead blown it out of proportion as if she is making a serious claim.</p> <p>The British police have still not officially given up their search for the missing child who if alive would be a teenager and aged 14.</p> <p>Scotland Yard took the case of her disappearance back in May, 2011. British police officials have looked at a total of some forty thousand or so documents in order to try to figure out where the young Madeline McCann might be.</p> <p>Investigators from Britain’s leading police force have thoroughly examined a total of 1027 exhibits while at the same time they have managed to take a total of 1338 statements.</p> <p>The case of the missing child went viral a decade ago and there has been no shortage of potential sightings of the young girl who at the time was only four years old. In fact there have a whopping total of 8685 sightings of the child. However Madeline McCann continues to remain stubbornly missing.</p> <p>Ever since she gone missing, it has been widely feared that she may have been taken by a sex predator preying on little children. In this connection officers from Scotland Yard also has considered and examined hundreds of sex offenders some 650 to be precise.</p> <p>Even though her case received perhaps more media attention than just about any other similar case of child abduction, she has still not been recovered even though Scotland Yard has been on the case for six years now they refuse to close and in April this year they reiterated that they were still looking at leads which the police said were significant and that the case had not yet been considered to have gone cold despite the fact that she has now been missing now for over a decade.</p> <p>The McCann family also established a sort of modern day precedent in the United Kingdom with regards to defamation and libel and were able to successfully sue British media outlets for false and irresponsible reporting that they done with many alleging that the parents had something to do with their daughter having gone missing.</p> <p>The problem of child trafficking is a global problem and according to figures provided by the United Nations around the World some 21 million people have been trafficked most commonly it is for forced labor and the sex trade which continues unabated. It is a multibillion dollar industry and generates more than 32 billion dollars in profits each and every year.</p> <p>Of these some five and a half million of them are children and are forced into such things as child pornography, prostitution, forced labor among other things. Girls overwhelmingly pushed into the prostitution industry.</p>     <p>We can only hope for her safe recovery and that she has not suffered a fate which many fear including abuse and potentially death. Her case is another reminder to us all of the need to protect the young and vulnerable from predators.</p>   <i></i>
