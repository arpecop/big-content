However, the case collapses after the judge sees a CCTV footage. Valentin Krzyzyk, a business graduate who works in finance, was accused of groping a woman at a club in central London.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1936.jpeg"/>Flipgram <h2>Confused Judge</h2> <p>While at the hearing for accusation, Judge Michael Bromley-Martin had to obtain a clarification the meaning of the ‘thot’. Waiter Labinot Citaku who had earlier heard Krzyzyk call the woman a ‘thot’ said that he spent around £6,000 on a bottle on vintage champagne.</p> <p>The waiter said that when he asked Krzyzyk about what had happened, he said that some woman came and stole his drinks and used derogatory language to describe what he did next. He said, “He lifted up her skirt, groped her bum and showed her what she should feel like. I don’t know the word – it is what we call a thot, a table whore”.</p> <p>This lead the judge to ask about the context in which the word ‘thot’ was used. The judge questioned, “Could we just go back to this thot thing. What was this thot?”</p> <p>In pop culture, it is a phrase for ‘that hoe over there’. It is a slang word that has a negative connotation. It means a whore or a slut. According to Citaku, ‘thot’ is used to refer to a girl who shows up to people’s tables to have drinks with them. They would also be sometimes referred to as ‘table whores’, and that they followed the champagne bottles.</p> <p>Citaku also explained what this means on an average night. He said that customers would get expensive champagne and vodka adorned with sparkles, served to them on their table, with their song of choice. To which judge commented saying the sparkles make it easy to for women.</p>     <p>The judge quoted, “They follow the bottles, made easier by the sparklers.”</p> <h2>The case</h2> <p>The barrister, Narita Bahra, denies these stating that her client did not use the word ‘thot’. Although he did complain about a woman drinking from his bottles. This incident took place on 20th December, and triggered Krzyzyk being kicked out of the pub. Later, on January 24th, the woman filed a complaint against him.</p> <p>Although it was put forward that even Krzyzyk has been facing revenge attacks, so he claims. Apparently, he was stripoed to his underwear and humiliated by the boyfriend of the victim outside a night club. However, the woman involved said this incident has caused her distress and she’s been crying.</p> <h2>Who is Valentin Krzyzyk?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1937.jpeg"/>Central News <p>Krzyzyk is an entrepreneur who runs his own company, and has founded several smartphone apps.</p> <p>He is a graduate of European Business School in paris. A billionaire who he used to work for, noticed his company and wanted him to work exclusively for him. He now works in finance, dealing with bonds.</p> <p>He also confessed in the court that spending £5,000 on a nightout is normal for him, and that this was a standard night out nothing more. He has an active social life that he is isn’t afraid to flaunt all over social media. He attributes the case to people being jealous because he lives near Buckingham Palace, lives in a great neighbourhood and drives a fantastic car.</p> <p>He admitted that this might leave in some people, a feeling that life’s been unfair to them. He said, “She might have felt it is unfair, that she has to work for one year to make what I spend in a night.”</p> <p>He was being tried for Sexual Assault under Sexual Offences Act. However, in the case demanded the CCTV footage to be handed to the court. It wasn’t initially presented but when it did surface, it was seen that the girl continued drinking with her friends after the alleged assault. This weakens her case.</p>     <p>Following this, the judge has cleared him of the charges, being annoyed of not being presented with the footage in the first place.</p>   <i></i>
