But sometimes they not only prove themselves as loyal friends but also much more. So has been done by a family dog Leala, a 9-year-old Staffordshire bull terrier who helped to save a two-year-old kid.</p> <p>David Kenny along with his family visited his friend’s house near Brisbane, Australia. On 5th of September, David’s dog Leala came running drenched which was unusual for Leale as she didn’t like cold water. When David suspected something wrong he ran with her and Leale took him to the dam. When David reached there he saw something that shook him up. He saw his 2-year-old son face-down floating in the water. David couldn’t believe what he just saw.</p> <p>According to him, “It was what I wished not to see, it was a mixture of disbelief, horror, and sadness, it was indescribable really, but then everything was a blur.” And of course what kind of parent won’t feel it when they see their life in such condition. So David rushed to pull him out of water and him along with his friends Jason and Joshua Cluff performed a CPR on Alexander for 27 minutes until the arrival of paramedics which then flew him by helicopter to the hospital.</p> <h2>The Love of Mother.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-793.jpeg"/>Coffscostadvocate.com <p>At the hospital, doctors didn’t give much hope to the parents and their assurance was negative. Alexander’s mother, Lisa said, “The doctors told me if he comes out alive he could have some sort of brain –damage.” But she didn’t lose hope. After being in a pediatric intensive care unit for almost 48 hours, Alexander was out of his induced coma and was demanding kisses from his family. It is a mother’s hope that gives strength to the child and which is never lost because there is a belief behind it that no power can separate her from her kids. In this case, Lisa’s hope gave Alexander the strength to fight his critical condition of an induced coma and he got out of it miraculously and so well that even doctors were stunned. His mother said they were too lucky to have Leala informing them along with the correct CPR techniques and the arrival of a helicopter and the right time that helped save her son.</p>     <h2>The Efforts of the father.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-794.jpeg"/>Kknews.cc <p>A father is the most responsible relation in a family. He is the supporter of food and shelter and all the basic necessities to all family members. But at some point in life, he has to play a heroic role in the rescue of his family members. What David did wasn’t any less than a heroic act. He saved his son by first bringing him out of the dam and then, with the help of his friend Joshua, who knew the correct technique of it, he performed a CPR to his son for almost 27 minutes until the paramedics didn’t reach. And this timely and proper CPR technique was the reason that his son, Alexander, didn’t get any brain damage. The doctors also put it on the correct CPR being administered to the kid when he was pulled out of water.</p> <h2>Good friends are the greatest gifts.</h2> <p>They say that having good friends is all that one should ask for, in their life. And if someone finds them they should never let go of them. But how to find out if a friend is good or not? Its simple, a friend who is there for you in the darkest of your time and helps you in your thick and thin is the good friend of yours. Jason and Joshua set an example of being a good friend in the rescue of Alexander. They were of great help to David in saving the life of his son. They were first of all the support of David when he saw his son half drowned in the water. He burst out into tears saying about his son that without his dog and his two mates his kid wouldn’t have been as he is now and he chocked saying that. As Joshua had just completed the CPR course he was of the major help in saving the life of Alexander.</p> <h2>The Day is saved thanks to Leala.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-795.jpeg"/>sosharethis.com     <p>Of course, the obvious being stated, Leala was the only one without whom Alexander wouldn’t have been rescued. She, first of all, tried to save him by herself but when she couldn’t she raced towards her owner and made him follow her to the dam from where the rescue process was begun. She surely has proved that there is no loyal friend to human as a dog.</p>   <i></i>
