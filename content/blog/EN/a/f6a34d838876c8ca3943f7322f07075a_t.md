         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 3<p>We, humans, are an embodiment to mistakes and flaws. No denying that right? If you ponder upon your daily life, gazillions of mistakes are committed by you intentionally or unintentionally. It’s just that you’re helpless in pursuing a perfect form of life. Perfection doesn’t exist and that’s why people who are possessing Idealism/Perfectionism traits are discontented all the time. They prefer symmetry in almost everything and this is coming from a perfectionist himself but this is not what we’re going to talk about right now.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-7zoc034013a-1-jp.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Most of us have faced emotional breakdowns due to multiple regrets we have in our lives. The time we’re committing that mistake, either we have this limited exposure towards right and wrong or we’re just doing in intentionally not aware of the consequences which will hit us deep within. Regrets are dissembled in every mistake we committed.</p> <p>Every wrongdoing we practice. There comes an age where all the regrets tumble upon you and you cannot halt it. Regrets are inevitable, why? Because they hit us at every wrong moment, most of the times when we’re submerged in bliss, when we’re quite contented with our lives it crash lands on our lives and on those tranquil moments we rejoice.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-7zoc03a5ffb-2-jp.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Many of you would think that there must be a remedy to this agony, yes there is. Regrets are often supported with bigger mistakes. We commit many mistakes with a scale. Some are big and some are small. Usually, the small ones don’t entail regrets. The large ones do, so avoid the large ones. When it comes to love, the regrets are quite agonizing. They just wrench you in every angle and you have to ask forgiveness or maybe patch up with the same person you broke up or cheated on intentionally. Well, folks let’s get deeper into this phenomenon.</p> <h2>About the Fallen love</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-7zoc038244b-3-jp.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>While walking down the pavement, your thoughts intermingle and one specific moment you realize you were just wrong there, you were just so wrong there and maybe you were the bad guy. These thoughts can alter into regrets. None of us would want to have same thoughts walking down the street all alone. The destruction of love starts with minor miscalculations.</p> <p>You don’t want to go back and see that your silly mistakes made the girl walk away and not just any girl, the one whom you imagined a perfect life, your ultimate soul mate. However, this is how it goes; we don’t value a human or a thing unless it flies away from us. As they say ‘everyone is different’, so yes you can’t find a similar person rather than them.</p> <p>How vulnerable we humans are, one incarnation can have such a strong nexus with the other one. The bond when broken can inflict a devastating pain on both. All your life you won’t escape it albeit you may have another partner but gazing back the path you walked on, it’s just never the same anymore.</p> <h2>Human Error</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-7zoc03eb3bd-4-jp.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Thou shall respect, Thou shall be ingenuous and thou shall be honest. Men claim to have chivalry but when the time is apt; they don’t display it and rather opt for the opposite. When it’s about your woman, it’s all chivalry. The dilemma is that once we possess someone we wanted so much, we forget the rules; we forget the decorum because it’s all yours then.</p> <p>Why would you even indulge in such a mindset when in the genesis you faked chivalry? Why do we even lend a space for regrets by our own hands when we know how much it can endanger us? We, humans, know the consequences, we know it from the very inception but due to our narrow horizon, we forget. Yes, we’ve weak memory.</p> <h2>What can one do?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-7zoc030744d-5-jp.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>The least you can do is to respect your woman, be empathetic, and understand her clamor. There is always something going on in our lives and when there is no one to lend a hand, we’re devastated. Ask her about her health, her thoughts. Are they endangering her? Are those because of you? ASK, ASK and ASK. The option of leaving should never be placed on the table. VALUE her. It’s all she needs. Men think these are some of the things women want but they fail to distinguish the difference between a need and a want. These are one of the things women need, so make sure you can bestow these upon her and you won’t lose her.</p> <h2>Value</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-7zoc03e903d-6-jp.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Valuing something is similar to placing it on a scale 0-10. Everyone wants to be valued. Without having something behind the back is like living a hollow life. Do you want your girl to feel the same? Place yourself in her place and feel the worthlessness when you don’t value her and repeatedly make her feel like she’s your 2nd option. Think of her doing the same with you and you’ll go nuts believe me. The problem lies with perceptions and a deficit of empathy.</p> <p>You perceive your woman to be satiated and that your love suffices her. NO, if you term love as being romantic sometimes and utter those three magical words, you’re wrong. Love is all about valuing the other person more than anyone and placing her where no one would take her place. However, the way you perceived love can be heartrending for the other person. Your significant other would walk away if you keep on afflicting the deficit-valuing rule. It won’t how tremendously they love you.</p> <p>There is something called self-esteem and it’s one of the basic needs of a human according to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. Do check it out. You disturb the protocol, you dismantle their basic need and then do you expect them to just sit idly and listen to whatever you’ve to say or shake their heads in approval on whatever you do.</p>     <h2>Gaps</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-7zoc0396ebe-7-jp.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Prefer her over anyone and never make her let go of your hand. Never close your heart to her, it’s not a safe. She disclosed everything to you so should you act like an insecure fella? You’re just pushing her. You’re just creating invisible gaps between you and her. It might not seem an issue of importance but when that coldness in attitude shivers you, you know you went the wrong path and yes you’re lost. She’s gone.</p> <h2>Her</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-7zoc0310e4e-8-jp.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>She needs the comfort in the bond you both have. She needs security. The feeling of being secure and being protected by you is inexorable yet wonderful. She never thinks twice in disclosing any of her flaws in front of you because she knows you’re the only soul who won’t ever judge her. We make mistakes and yes we’ve to understand that anyone in this whole-wide-world isn’t an angel. She isn’t perfect but if you keep mocking her or lambasting her over her past and blemishes, she’ll feel worthless and yes she’ll portray herself as the worst of human beings.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-7zoc035471e-9-jp.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>She already committed her life to you; she spent all her hours with you why can’t you be consistent with her? Love is all about being consistent, being honest throughout and possessing the same behavior and attitude you had when you first met her. The aspects and traits on which she fell for you should be consistent. She pondered upon you and those traits whom you feel aren’t having any value, do remember she loved you and love you because of them.</p> <p>Valuing her love and equally responding with the same affection won’t ever make her let you go. She needs all of you. Not just your body, not just your name but all of you.</p> <h2>Reasons for discontent</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-7zoc03d772e-10-j.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>What made her leave you? What made her reactions so cold that you just can’t figure what went wrong? From <strong>I LOVE YOU</strong> to <strong>I DON’T WANT TO LIVE WITH YOU</strong>, what was the cause? There are a plethora of questions to be answered but you already inflicted so much pain upon yourself that you can’t think straightly and profoundly over it. The problem was YOU. Yes, you, these modes of attitude you’re thinking about were same with her. You adopted these behavioral traits and used them on her and now you’re asking yourself, ‘what went wrong?’</p> <p>You repeatedly lied to her and when you got caught up with those lies, you fought her. It wasn’t her fault. You were being dishonest and you didn’t have the right to rebuke her over your own misdoing. You just inserted a border between your nexus. Now one of you has to climb up the border and compromise it but the one the wrong side is much more responsible towards the climbing part. SO if you know you’re dwelling on the wrong side, you’ve to make the first move and not her but failed to do so, you can lose her for eternity.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-7zoc038a08f-11-j.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>She is going to walk away from you if you term her as an object rather as a subject of love and treat her as an artifact. She is a human and she can sense when she is being used and abused rather than taken care of. She is going to sense when you wrongly manipulate her and she is not going to let you disfigure and disdain her pure feelings.</p> <p>When you try to compete with her over every minimal thing, she would think that this relationship is all about self-supremacy. Like a guy trying to prove he is better than you in every aspect and every choice you made was wrong. They fail to realize that you chose them also and indirectly they’re negating their very existence themselves. People fail to see the two sides of the coin and pass judgments. If you keep doing this to her with your unprofessional and naïve advancements, she is going to let go of you really soon.</p> <h2>Investing your heart and time</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-7zoc033d87f-12-j.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>The relationship is all about investment and yes you do expect profits, not in terms of money but love and affection. She is ready to invest all her heart and time with you and in return, she expects the same but if it goes another way round from your side, she’ll consider the investment as a bad one and hence would withdraw her time, heart and her physical presence from the faulty venture. She kept investing her heart and soul in you and you clean-wiped all of it without noticing the worth to these things.</p> <p>You disrespect her property and her investment and you expect her of not doing anything about it? If that’s the case you’re daydreaming. She is straightly going to walk away from such kind of bondage because her needs aren’t satiated and straightly speaking she isn’t earning any profit over her investment so why keep the faulty venture when you can just let go of the loses and live a somewhat more peaceful life. I know some people would term this as absurd but this is how it is and there are no reasons to disqualify this logic.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-appdata-local-temp-7zoc03cc20f-13-j.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com     <p>So lads please give her what is rightfully hers. Don’t snatch away her feelings and deprive her of her love towards you. Be generous in loving her and don’t ever be competitive. She might be better than you but for the sake of your bondage, she never tries to prove it rather listens to you. Love her unconditionally because life is too short to have many regrets. Be regret-less. Adieu!</p>   <i></i>
