My God</p> <p>Feature Image:</p> <p><img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-admin-desktop-ahsan-2048-jpg.jpeg"/></p> <p>He may be adamant that he’s a single Pringle. However, Justin Bieber has always been linked with a horde of ridiculously gorgeous women – let’s just have a look at the ladies he has been associated with and actually has slept with.</p> <h2>1: Caitlin Beadles</h2>      <p>A post shared by Caitlin Beadles (@caitlinbeadles) on Jul 26, 2017 at 8:29am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Justin and Caitlin met at the church when he moved to Atlanta. They were dating for like a year until she finally broke up with him in the year 2009 as his career was taking off and she didn’t want to be in the spotlight. Although, they were still good friends even after the breakup. Justin also talked very openly about Caitlin in his interviews, and also in few of the songs that he wrote for his first album and some for his second were about Caitlin including “Never Let You Go.” They’re still friends to this day and occasionally hang out</p> <h2>2: Jessica Jarrell</h2>      <p> Know the value of knowing your value #lostfiles</p> <p>A post shared by Jessica Jarrell (@jessicajarrell) on Sep 1, 2017 at 11:08pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>She is a singer, an actress, and also a model.</p> <p>Jessica is signed to Island Def. Jam – Mercury records.</p> <p>In the year 2010, she did a duet with the teen sensation at that time Justin Bieber in the song overboard, and she was on the “My World 2.0 Tour” with Justin performing some of the hit songs.</p> <p>She is a good friend with Justin Bieber and Cody Simpson.</p> <h2>3: Miley Cyrus</h2>      <p> Vote ! #Malibu BEST POP @vmas !!!! ❤️🌹</p> <p>A post shared by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Aug 4, 2017 at 10:09am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>It might seem like that they have been separated at birth, but Miley and Justin’s rumored affair is one of the strangest one until now. Also, an American magazine claimed that Miley and Justin hooked up and she got pregnant. However, the ‘Wrecking Ball’ star hit back by posting a picture of the magazines cover mocking that fact, that has been claiming that Miley and Selena had been pregnant by the same man, captioned “and by that we mean Justin Bieber.” Well not sure if that’s true though. Rumors are rumors, what can we say and these celebrities do have a controversial life, at least Miley and Justin, both do.</p> <h2>4: Mandy Rain</h2>      <p> You just put your arms around me &amp; I am home 🏡</p> <p>A post shared by Mandy Rain (@themandyrain) on Aug 7, 2017 at 11:03am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Mandy Rain, is an American recording artist, dancer, and actress.

However, Bieber did not take the lesson and posted Miranda’s picture on his Instagram account as a way to taunt Bloom, but deleted immediately. Journalist and fans could not confirm whether it was true or not.
