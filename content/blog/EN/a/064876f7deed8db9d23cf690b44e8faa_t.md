The only problem she faced was finding the perfect tattoo artist for the job. That’s when Kelly stepped in and showed the world how your scars can be beautiful as well.</p>      <p> Shoot spam 😂💕 such a fun time though with @burningimageireland ✌🏼️ #purplehair #photoshoot #temblebar</p> <p>A post shared by Aoife Lovett (@alien.from.saturn) on Aug 14, 2016 at 7:54am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>The road to recovery is never an easy one, but taking the first step on that road is important. Choosing life instead of pain, misery, death, only a few can be so lucky. That is why 19-year-old Aoife Lovett is ever so grateful to the tattoo artist who helped her to take the first step towards a better life.</p> <h2>Time Heals All Wounds</h2>      <p> Drunken throw back😂😂🖒👽 #throwback</p>     <p>A post shared by Aoife Lovett (@alien.from.saturn) on Jul 20, 2017 at 11:25am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>During her teen years, the 19-year-old struggled with depression, anxiety, and self-harm. Even though she stopped self-harming a few years ago, her scars are a constant reminder of the pain she went through. These scars trigger a memory of a very dark past, that she was so desperate to get rid of. Yes, with time those scars will heal, and they will fade but never truly be gone. The first step</p> <p>“It’s very hard when you’re a couple of years clean from doing it and every day you’re constantly reminded of what you did. It brings back memories of how you felt then. There’s a lot of shame that comes with it and guilt, especially when you’re around your family.”</p> <h2>The First Step</h2> <p>So, Aoife decided it would be a beautiful idea to cover the scars with a tattoo. The beauty of the ink will make the ugliness of the scar disappear. The only problem was finding a tattoo artist that was willing to work on scarred skin. Apparently, it’s very difficult to get a tattoo if you have scars as it’s not a smooth surface, and well let’s be honest, not a lot of takers either.</p> <h2>The Hero</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/c-users-administrator-downloads-1-11-2553-03-jpg.jpeg"/>independent.bbvms.com <p>She soon met the man that would solve all her problems, Ryan, a young tattoo artist who just recently lost his mentor to depression and suicide. Ryan also had his own battle with anxiety, so when Lovett walked into the tattoo shop that day and asked to get her scars tatted, he decided to take her up on the challenge.</p> <p>“A girl just randomly came in looking for a tattoo to cover up some scars and I got talking to her and she started telling me her story and at the end of that, it didn’t really feel right to charge her. It kind of felt like it meant more to her than that.”</p> <h2>Scars Behind Beauty</h2> <p>Inspired by the encounter, Kelly later went on to open a non-profit organization called Scars Behind Beauty. The organization offers those who are victims of self-harm to get tattoos to cover up their scars for free! Kelly managed to turn Lovett scars into a beautiful work of art, and she’s been doing better ever since.</p> <p>It seems like other artists are getting inspired by Kelly as well. Pepper Seger went viral after he posted a picture of him covering up heavy scars on a young woman.</p> <h2>Reference Link</h2>     <p>http://www.inspiremore.com/tattoo-artist-covers-scars/</p>   <i></i>
