We have to cook, clean eat, work, all while maintaining our presence on social media. However, we just may be making our lives more difficult than they have to be. When is the last time we stopped to think of a way around a tiny problem?</p> <p>Below are some examples of how we can use everyday objects to make our routines easier. You may be surprised at how using these tips could make your tiny frustrations go away! Plus, it doesn’t hurt that these may also make your surroundings a little neater and cleaner.</p> <h2>1: Sauce cubes</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2180-1-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Seasoned cooks may be able to eyeball just how much sauce to make. Most of us, however, usually play it safe by making a little extra. After the meal, we usually end up throwing away the excess sauce. It’s either that or letting it rot in the fridge for a few days and then throwing it away.</p> <p>You can avoid this unfortunate wastage by simply putting the sauce into an ice cube tray. This way, it’s super easy to pop out a few cubes whenever you need them. Of course, you could freeze the whole sauce in one batch. The problem is that you would have to use it all at once the next time.</p> <p>With the ice cube tray method, you can take out a little sauce for your mac and cheese one night. A few nights later, you can thaw one cube and use as a dipping sauce for your pizza! The possibilities are endless.</p> <p>What’s more, the ice cube tray hacks don’t end here. You can freeze just about any leftovers that you may need in tiny portions later on. This includes cookie dough, black coffee, and even berries.</p> <h2>2: No more buying cheese slices</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2180-2-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Buying cheese slices is not that hard, but it does result in a lot of garbage. It’s also more expensive than buying a block of cheese in the long run. This little trick also comes in handy when you want very thin cheese slices for toppings or decorations.You use a potato peeler for cutting slices out of a block or wheel of cheese. You may be surprised at how efficiently and neatly this lifehack works. Enjoy the cheese with your nachos, on your bread, or atop a homemade pizza.</p> <h2>3: Getting every last drop</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2180-3-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Not everyone has pre-squeezed lemon juice on hand. There are also special lemon squeezers on the market, but what if you don’t have one of those? The answer is to microwave the lemons for a few seconds. They would become a bit softer and would thus be easier to squeeze.</p> <p>This is an awesome little tip to help along your lemonade-making. It would make taking out the seeds easier as well as make sure you get all the juice out. Plus, there’s less effort involved.</p> <h2>4: The magic ketchup number</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2180-4-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>All of us have wrestled with the ketchup bottle at some point. First, the ketchup just won’t flow, and you have to smack it repeatedly. Then, it flows all at once, covering your plate with an embarrassing amount.</p> <p>Never fear; ketchup manufacturers are very much aware of this dilemma. That’s why they have placed a special number on each bottle. Look for the number 57, turn the bottle at an angle, and hit on the number. You would then be prepared for the flow of ketchup and can pour just as much as you’d like.</p> <p>Some people prefer to buy the kind of ketchup bottle you can squeeze. This is one way out of the bottle-hitting dilemma. However, the squeezing bottle isn’t always an option. You may be faced with a glass bottle of ketchup at restaurant or at someone else’s house. With this trick up your sleeve, you can avoid awkward situations in public.</p> <h2>5: Wiping up glass</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2180-5-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>When something gets broken, you usually get sad at losing that object. However, that is quickly outweighed by the frustration of having to clean up the mess. Of course, the dustpan and brush do come in handy at times like these. You may not always have those on hand, though. Plus, brushes may leave tiny shards on the floor, endangering animals and children as well as your own feet.</p> <p>One solution to such a problem is to use a slice of bread, preferably white. The slightly sticky feature of bread along with its texture effectively mops up even minuscule pieces of glass.</p> <p>Sure, some people may see this trick as a waste of food. However, since you are utilizing the bread to protect yourself and your loved ones, it’s a small price to pay. This way, you can clean up broken glass wherever you are, be it at a picnic or a cafeteria.</p> <h2>6: Elastic bands to prevent hand burns</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2180-6-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>You wouldn’t think that elastic bands could prevent your burning your hands, would you? Well, they can!</p> <p>While cooking, many of us find the need to leave a spoon in a pot. This may also be necessary when you’re setting up a party table, or just getting ready to serve your food. However, spoons have an irritating tendency to slide right into the pot instead of staying on one side. This could make you waste some food and possibly burn your hands while trying to retrieve it.</p> <p>Since none of us have time to waste, try wrapping an elastic band around the spoon handle next time. This would provide enough friction to prevent the spoon from plopping into the pot’s contents. Spoons don’t have a flavor, but no one wants the whole thing in the food either!</p> <h2>7: Homemade loose corn</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2180-7-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Corn on the cob is a delicious side dish, but you occasionally need the loose kind. Instead of buying it separately, you can utilize the cobs you already have. Getting all the grains out may seem like a painstaking task, but there’s a way around it.</p> <p>All you need to do is a Bundt cake pan. This would have a raised hole in the middle. Balance your corncob against this raised part and use a sharp knife to slice the grains off. This provides a handy way to get the cobs clear of the grains and collect the grains in one place. You wouldn’t have to go in search of one grain flying off into the corner!</p> <h2>8: Rubber bands for stubborn jars</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2180-8-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Trying to get the lid off a new jar is a pain, to say the least. The vacuum inside the jar makes it difficult to open. Luckily, there are several ways to get the lid off, other than almost breaking your arm.</p> <p>The most tried and tested ways are using a towel or warming up the jar itself. If these don’t work out, you can try the rubber band trick. Put a thick rubber band around the jar lid, and give it a twist. This method would provide the friction you need to pop open that annoying jar or even a bottle!</p>     <h2>9: Leveling measures with masking tape</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2180-9-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Measuring spoons are a lifesaver, especially for bakers. However, leveling off different products in the spoon can cause a mess. Prevent this from happening by sticking a piece of masking tape across the top of every container you use.</p> <p>The masking tape would come in handy for scraping off the excess amount when you spoon out an ingredient. Some people also recommend using a butter knife for this. However, the masking tape could be fixed in place, and the container’s lid can be put on top of it. This makes things much easier than grabbing a knife every time.</p> <h2>10: No sliding while cutting</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2180-10-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Cutting boards are a useful tool for chopping fruits, vegetables, or meat. However, one problem with some boards is that they may move around when you’re using them. This could interfere with the ease of chopping or cutting anything on the board. Plus, you’re also risking your fingers when you cut on a ‘migratory’ board.</p> <p>The solution here is to simply put a wet paper towel under the offending board. The wetness would make it stick to the counter. A very easy trick results in much easier and safer cooking.</p> <h3>11: Enjoy a scented candle longer</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2180-11-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Scented candles can greatly add to the ambiance when you’re hosting a party or simply having a quiet night in. when you have a scent you particularly like, you would obviously want to make it last as long as possible. It’s also good to get the most use out of anything, even candles.</p> <p>Hence, stay smart with your candles by freezing them for 24 hours before you light them. This would make sure that the wax burns more slowly. As a result, the candle would last twice as long. Don’t take our word for it, though. Purchase two identical candles, and freeze one of them. Light them both and enjoy their light and scent. Then see which candle lasts the longest. Thank us later.</p> <h2>12: Snap off instead of sharpening</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2180-12-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>This is a brilliant design hack that has us all reeling! Everyone has used a paper cutter or a utility knife at some point in their lives. We’ve all noticed the little grooves down the side on the blade too. However, we may not have realized just how useful and ingenious their design plan is.</p> <p>When our utility knives get blunt, we usually end up throwing them away. Quite a waste, as it turns out. There’s a little black cup with a slot on the end of each knife. Simply pop that out, and insert the blunt bade into the slot. Then you can sharply snap off the blunt part at the groove. The result is a brand new blade, ready for work! No sharpening tools and your knife lasts several times longer.</p> <h2>13: Be safe with spaghetti</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2180-13-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>If you’re someone who loves candles or uses long safety matches, keep your spaghetti handy. Lon safety matches are a great precaution, but not everyone can buy them. They may not be available, or just be something else to clutter up your cupboards.</p> <p>A single piece of raw spaghetti works just as well for lighting up something at a distance. Simply set one end aflame with the help of a conventional match. This would help you stay safe when lighting candles, fires, or when conducting scientific experiments.</p> <h2>14: Hook the garbage down</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2180-14-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Placing a garbage bag in a dustbin makes taking out the garbage easier. However, these bags do have a tendency to split, or even fall into the bin itself. This can result in a potentially disgusting mess.</p> <p>To protect your comfort, invest in some clothing hooks. These are inexpensive plastic contraptions that can stick to any dry surface. On average, they can hold around one to three kilograms. Place these on the side of your bin with the hook side facing up. All you have to do then is secure the handle of the bag to the hooks. All safe and sound!</p> <h2>15: A surprising use for eggshells</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2180-15-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Glass bottles are very much in vogue now. Plastic may be more convenient but isn’t the healthiest option. Plus, you can use glass bottles for hot liquids as well as cold.</p> <p>The only downsides to glass bottles are the breakability and the cleaning process. You may not be able to find a proper brush for every size of glass bottle you have. So simply crush the eggshells left over from breakfast, and put them into the bottle. Close the cap, shake the whole thing. Once you rinse it all out, your bottle would hopefully be sparkling!</p> <h2>16: Saving herbs for a rainy day</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2180-16-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Don’t throw away leftover herbs. Put them in the microwave for a few seconds until they’re dry. You can then put them into jars and save them for the next meal. Alternatively, you can get out your ice cube tray and freeze the herb with some oil.</p> <h2>17: A beautiful and sneaky trick</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2180-17-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Put a piece of lace or a doily over a cake or muffin.
