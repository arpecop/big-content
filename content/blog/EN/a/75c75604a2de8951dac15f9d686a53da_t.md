Many people follow what the signs instruct them to do and some even consult their horoscope before doing anything of importance. Most of the people I know have traits that have been perfectly explained by what zodiac sign they were born under<strong>. </strong>But have you ever thought which of your body part is represented by your star? The human body comes in many shapes and sizes. And as the planets move around their path they interact with the signs. This can add importance to the part of a person’s body ruled by that sign. Read on below to see which of your body part is important according to the zodiac sign you were born under.</p> <h2>12. Aries</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2322.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>Aries is a fire sign, meaning they exude energy and like to ‘get things done’. If you know an Aries you probably have learned by now about their headstrong personality. Aries are mentally tough and like to be leaders. It is due to these qualities that their representative body part is the head. Therefore, Aries are competitive and like to think things through before attempting them. But once they decide that something is worth doing, then nobody can stand in their path! As they are ruled by the head they are self-reliant and like their independence. They often literally walk head first into any task at hand, leaning forwards for speed and focus.</p> <h2>11. Taurus</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2323.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>Taurus is represented by the bull, and rightly so. People ruled by this sign are reliable, passionate and devoted, but also stubborn and possessive. It is this possessiveness that sometimes lands them in trouble as they cannot give much freedom to the people they love. Taurus are natural guides and like to instruct people so the body part that represents them best is the neck. The neck has the ability to turn the head around anywhere and the voices emanated from the throat are enough to influence anybody, and this is the perfect description of a Taurus’ personality type. Just as the neck stands tall and proud, Taurus people have an innate sense of individuality and do not bend down to anyone. They are open to others’ idea but would analyze them and do what they think is the best, regardless of what others think. They like their stubbornness and pass it off as ‘knowing themselves well’, which indeed they do.</p> <h2>10. Gemini</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2324.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>This is the sign that is represented by two persons generally known as the twins. This depicts the fact that Geminis are famous for their double personalities. They might have a fun, outgoing persona at work, but as soon as they enter home, they become quiet and introverted. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it is just what Geminis are! The planet ruling them is Mercury, which comes as no surprise at all, as Mercury is famous for its volatile nature. As Geminis are represented by The Twins, it is no wonder that the most important body part for them is their two hands.</p> <p>Geminis are generally gentle but can also be harsh if you get on their wrong side. Thus, the hand can pat gently, as well as slap harshly. These hands also depict their giving nature, as Geminis love to share and are at their happiest when helping people. Gemini people are usually good at writing- they make exceptional calligraphers- and communication.</p> <h2>9. Cancer</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2325.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>This is the most harmonious sign of all. With gentle, caring personalities, Cancers make the best of friends. Cancer is a water sign with the moon ruling it. Imagine a peaceful, bubbling brook flowing through a forest on a calm night and you have the essence of a Cancer’s personality. Cancers are loyal, emotional, and generous, and like to relax at home with their loved ones. It is due to their soft heart that the body part representing them is the chest.</p> <p>They like to nurture people and once they have decided to like you, they would keep you in their heart forever. Cancers find it hard to trust people, but when they do, they open themselves up fully and love unconditionally. However, their emotional outlook on life makes it hard for them to adjust in the materialistic world and sometimes they end up feeling left out.</p> <h2>8. Leo</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2326.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>The lion. Leos are ruled by the Sun and is one of the fire signs.

Virgos are not influenced easily and hold on to their beliefs.</p> <p>Their high intelligence makes them a wandering personality, always looking for further challenges to enhance their intellectuality.
