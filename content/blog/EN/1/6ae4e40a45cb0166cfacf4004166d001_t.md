If you follow them correctly, there’s a huge chance that he won’t ever be able to see anyone but you. We’re not talking about putting a spell on him either, so put away your robe and witching hat!</p> <p>There are, in fact, some everyday habits women can adopt in order to become irresistible to the men in their life. Read on to find out what they are:</p> <h2>10. Spritz It Up</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1218.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>An old tactic for attraction is to spray on some delicious perfume, cologne, or scent. Ta tantalizing smell can make him remember you even when you’re not there. It may also remind him of the many wonderful times he’s had with you in the past. Don’t forget that smell is one of the greatest memory invokers known to man!</p> <p>If you use your scents right, you may not even have to remind him of your relationship. And it would take is one whiff, and he remembers everything!</p> <h2>9. Enjoy Yourself!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1219.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Negativity is unfair on your partner, especially when it’s a constant in your life. If you’re the brooding sort, try to understand his need to see you happy. Hence, make a supreme effort to enjoy life even when you don’t particularly feel like it.</p> <p>There’s nothing wrong with being good and miserable now and then, but making a habit of it is not healthy. It would also serve to make your man connect you with sadness. We can accurately guess how you feel about that!</p> <p>When he sees you enjoying your life, he would automatically become attracted to you. This would show him that you’re someone who isn’t dependent on anyone but herself for a good time. This would automatically make him want to get in on the fun!</p> <h2>8. Take Control</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1220.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>The notion of a damsel in distress is hopelessly outdated now. Be strong and independent in order to win his love and deserve it. Depending upon him for every emotional and material need would only exhaust him and his resources.</p> <p>So, for example, if you don’t know how to drive, don’t call him for a lift every time. Call an Uber, or take lessons. The confidence to take charge would likely have him hankering after you rather than the other way around!</p> <h2>7. Connect With His People</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1221.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>A man can be deeply in love with a woman but end up leaving her if she hates his friends or family. These are two very sensitive areas for any person, and men seem to be especially loyal here. We’re not saying that women are any less so, though.</p> <p>If you really want his undying love and loyalty, be sure to make a good impression on his friends and family. These are the people he knows best. If they approve of you, he would find it easier to fall in love with you and never look back! Then again, you would also have to make sure you don’t end up with a demanding mama’s boy. If this is the case, drop him like a hot potato.</p> <p>The best way to win him through family and friends is to show them respect. This applies even if you can’t love or even like them very much. Hopefully, he would see your efforts and be crazy about you for your patience and kindness.</p> <h2>6. Don’t Make an Effort</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1222.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>No, this doesn’t mean you let yourself go physically. We’ll cover the maintenance part later on. However, right now we are talking about your personality and who you are on the inside.</p>     <p>Simply put, don’t knock yourself out trying to be someone you’re not. We all strive to be better versions of ourselves, but negating ourselves entirely is not the answer. The more we’re ourselves, the easier we can be. If he has fun with the real you, that’s what you want to pursue.</p> <p>Showing a man who you are would be sure to attract the right one. Once he likes you for yourself, more than half your work is done. You can now start a relationship based on absolute truth and ease of mind.</p> <h2>5. Head Up High</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1223.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Have your standards and be vocal about them. If you want some space, ask for it. Moreover, respect yourself in your daily interactions. Watching someone get browbeaten every day by a boss or coworker is hardly an uplifting experience. You want your man to see you walking with dignity, not fear or uncertainty.</p> <p>You must also be careful to respect yourself when you’re talking. If you constantly deprecate yourself, it doesn’t make anyone feel good. If they like this weak side of you, you may want to reconsider building a relationship with them.</p> <h2>4. Soften Up</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1224.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>If you’re a tough nut, stay that way. We need tough women, but we also need a whole lot of kindness in the world. Don’t be afraid to pet a cat or feed it if it looks hungry. Many times, the man beside you would highly appreciate your thoughtfulness. Just as a note, he would probably appreciate it better if you don’t immediately put your kind act on social media to gain like.</p> <p>Pure and selfless kindness is hard to come by these days. So be that unique person of which one can be sure of kindness every time.</p> <h2>3. Voice What You Want</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1225.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>If you want to eat some junk food once in a while, feel free to say it out loud! Both of you may be on a healthy kick, but you can be the first to suggest a cheat meal. Don’t leave everything up to him to decide; otherwise, you both would feel tested, confused, and unhappy. Not a good thing for any relationship in our opinion.</p> <p>However, make sure you’re not taking the lead every time. This could lead to bossiness, and could turn off a man faster than you can say ‘make me a sandwich’.</p> <p>To cut a long story short, don’t be afraid of saying what you want to say. Too much politeness could be fatal for your relationship strength, and too little can be the same. Think of it like salt in food; just sprinkle enough to give a bit of flavor instead of overwhelming it.</p> <h2>2. Maintain Yourself</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1226.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Don’t think that just because you have a man in your life you can wander around in pajamas all day. You can be comfortable in some nice soft clothes that haven’t been slept in. The person you love the most deserves your best looks, don’t you think.</p> <p>We’re not saying you have to put your face on before breakfast. However, basic hygiene, scent, and a little work on your general grooming are much appreciated.</p> <p>The same goes for healthy eating. Packing on the pounds is just not healthy for you, even if your partner loves you just the same. However, the added weight could create serious health issues and restrict your movement. These burdens could put a serious strain on the relationship. So be sure to let him know how much you care by putting some regular work into yourself!</p> <h2>1. Open Up</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1227.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>We don’t mean you unload each and every problem on him. This would exhaust another person and even drive them towards depression. On the other hand, don’t curl up inside your shell and expect a man to fall in love with you.</p> <p>If the two of you are getting close, tell him some deep fears, goal, and important views. These would give him an idea of who you are. Thus, he would love you for you, and not for your looks or any other material aspect.</p>     <p>You may have noticed that the above tips would make you love yourself more too! This is, of course, just as important as making a man fall for you. Keep in mind that men are all different, so not every method may work on them.</p>   <i></i>
