         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 2<p>The world is getting introduced every day with new findings and inventions. We hear about new planets and stars being discovered. Someday an old treasure in a mummy tomb would dig up or a new drug to cure rare disease would be created.</p> <p>Mankind has found ways to overcome every hurdle in its way. We have found answers to the unsolved queries that linger around us but sometimes even humans come across some events that are left unexplained. Some happening around you might not have a rational answer.</p> <p>Not everyone believes in supernatural powers and ghosts, but we have piled up for you some of the baffling and mysterious events that occurred with ordinary people just like you and me. So here are 10 extremely disturbing paranormal activities that don’t have a rational explanation.</p> <h2>10. What a cute monster?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1044.jpeg"/>@minimovie.tk <p>We have all seen the movie Annabelle and met that horrific ugly doll, but a few people know that this movie is actually are real incident and an actual Annabelle doll exist. Annabelle is a Raggedy Ann doll and not that creepy as shown in the movie. It is kept boxed up in a glass cube at Ed and Loren Warren’s house. Ed and Loren Warren say that the doll is possessed by a satanic soul and can cause extreme trouble to anyone who has it. The doll has been there since 1970 and will probably live there forever.</p> <h2>9. Let’s create a ghost</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1046.jpeg"/>@Historyvs.Hollywood <p>Toronto Society for Psychical Research (TSPR) was founded in 1970. Dr. Alan Robert George Owen a mathematician from trinity college Cambridge performed the parapsychology research with his wife and few other fellows.</p> <p>In 1972, they created a fictional ghost named Philip Aylesford and settled on a background story for him. This experiment took place in Toronto, Canada and was done to determine if subjects can talk fictional ghost. It was reported that the participants felt sudden jolts, movement of the table, unexplained noises and quiet breezes. There came a point when the table even tilted at on leg.</p> <h2>8.Hums’ around the world</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1047.jpeg"/>@ Shutterstock <p>You can hear an unexplained beep sometimes. You scratch your ear and it goes away but in 2012 people around the world started hearing these weird sounds all around the globe. People made videos and posted them on social media. It all went viral. You can hear a sound of many angels’ place harps. Some people even say that it is because of High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program or more commonly known as HAARP project. The United States of America created this project.</p> <h2>7. Oh Boy!</h2>  <p>He had a huge misshapen head that was dented on one side. I did my best to draw it: pic.twitter.com/AJizlw7qXe</p> <p>— Adam Ellis (@moby_dickhead) August 7, 2017</p> <p> If you are really a fan of horror movies and paranormal activities, you should follow the artist Adam Elis on twitter. Apparently, he has been haunted by a ghost of a cute little boy named David. His first interaction with the boy was in his dream where he learned that the boy was named “Dear David”. The ghost became attached to David and now furniture at David’s House is starting to move even his cat is scared.</p> <p>To top it off David can now be sighted. This getting creepier every day.</p> <h2>6. Live Exorcism</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1048.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>In 1970, Ed Becker and his wife Marsha Becker bought a house in Chicago. This nice and cosy home was perfect for them until mysterious things started happening. It started with things moving on their own and progressed to Ed Becker having weird visions. It was too much for the family to bear so the called up some exorcists from the church.</p>     <p>Their house was exorcised in front of the national television as it was telecasted live all over the world. Ed Becker then wrote a book named “True Hauntings” and its second part “True Hauntings 2” was also written. Ed Becker penned down all the events that happened to him and his family.</p> <h2>5. Strange Calls</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1049.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If you are driving on an empty road alone at night, never give a ride to the people who ask for hitchhiking. They might be haunted ghosts. In 2015 in Utah, A mother and her baby girl fell in the river after an accident. When the rescue team arrived at the spot, they distinctively heard a shout of a woman calling for help.</p> <p>This increased their process of rescue, but it was shocking.
