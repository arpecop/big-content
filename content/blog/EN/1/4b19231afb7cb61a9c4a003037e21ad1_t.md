         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 0<p>History lessons – we remember avoiding them like the plague. Slow, dry and boring. Who could be bothered to study about old men in white wigs who all look like they’ve seen better days?</p> <p>The truth is, though, that there is more than meets the eye. Behind every President’s climb up the ladder to becoming the Head of State of one of the most powerful nations of the world, there are also incidents of awkward, unbelievable and dare we say it – risqué behavior as well!</p> <p>Do you know one of the Presidents vandalized Shakespeare’s property? Or one of them grew marijuana? How about the fact that one of them was a huge fan of skinny dipping? Excited already? Here are some very interesting facts about the U.S. Presidents your history teacher won’t tell you!</p> <h2>13. President Andrew Jackson’s foul-mouthed parrot</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1035.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>President Andrew Jackson is famous for his duels, which he always put on a brave face for. A huge advocate for ‘taking it outside’ and always down to settle things the ‘old fashioned way’, President Jackson is reported to have been in over 100 duels in his lifetime.</p> <p>Usually triggered due to something someone would have said about his wife, he once took a bullet to the chest and once to the arm, and this was shot by a senator who picked a fight with him in a bar!</p> <p>Perhaps the most interesting fact about him though is that President Jackson had taught his pet parrot how to curse. Well-versed in foul language (Do parrots count as fouls? Pun opportunity here!), the parrot had a common habit of squawking out abuses. So much so that it had to be removed from the President’s funeral because of constantly running its potty mouth.</p> <h2>12. President Martin van Buren’s birth</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1036.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>What does it take to become the President of what is perhaps the world’s most diverse, most competitive and top-tier powerful nations? Do you need the red, white and blue to run through your veins? Do you need the sight and courage of a bald eagle? Well, not so much. Known as the ‘Sly Fox’ for his political skills, ‘Little Magician’ because he only stood at 5’6” and “Old Kinderhook’ for his childhood home, this short, red-haired and mentally invincible President was actually the very first President to actually be born inside the United States!</p> <h2>11. President William Henry Harrison’s determination</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1037.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>They say sometimes holding on hurts much more than letting go, but apparently they didn’t say this in President Harrison’s time. Proving to be a tough challenge for the opposition, they were quick in labelling him as ‘someone who would sit in his log cabin all day, drinking hard cider”. Detrimental to his Presidential campaign, President Harrsion had a witty response in stirring up spiked lemonade and distributing Whiskey in bottles shaped like log cabins! However, his wit wasn’t exponential. President Harrison did go on to win the elections, but delivered the longest inauguration speech ever – a whopping 8,445 in 90 minutes. What’s bad about this, you ask? Well, he did it on a cold and wet 1841 day and fell ill afterwards. And yeah, this was the reason he died. Only 33 days into Presidency. If he were here today, we would share that song Let It Go with him. You know, the one from Frozen! Talk about co-incidence!</p> <h2>10. President John Tyler’s fans</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1038.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>We placed President Tyler right under President Harrison in our list since this man was originally the Vice President in President Harrison’s regime. Not sure of his fate in office, he somehow convinced everyone that he should be made President. This was catered to, and the 25th amendment bears witness to it, but the thing is, no one, and we mean no one, liked him. As a matter of fact, people actually hated him! His own party expelled him during his presidency, his entire cabinet resigned over his policies and he was the first President of the U.S. to face impeachment. When he passed away, the New York Times was kind enough to remember him in an obituary, but stated that he was the most unpopular man to hold office. Think that’s bad? Upon his death, Lincoln didn’t issue a morning proclamation and flags weren’t cast at half-mast! Ouch!</p> <h2>9. President Zachary Taylor’s death</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1039.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>What do you think when you see the Washington Monument? How does it make you feel? Well, that might change. You’ve been warned! Celebrating the 4th of July on the grounds where the Washington Monument would later be erected, President Taylor was having a blast as he was downing some cherries and washing them down with iced milk. Hey, the man liked his cold milk and cherries, don’t knock it till you try it. Unfortunately, this combination didn’t sit too well (Pun intended) and due to a raging bacterial infection, President Taylor passed away just a few days later. Though can never be joked about, there’s no harm in saying he at least had some fun before he left this world. As some people say, we’re here for a good time. Not for a long time!</p> <h2>8. President John Quincy Adam’s secret to health</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1040.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>President John Adams lived to see 90 years go by, and considering he was around in the 18th Century, that’s quite impressive. So much so, actually, that Gold’s Gym conducted some research into it and concluded that it was his exercise regime that kept him so fit. Though he wasn’t exactly a gym rat, President Adams was a fan of skinny dipping. After having walked three miles, President Adams would swim the width of the Potomac River each day at 5 a.m. completely nude. He wasn’t afraid to admit this, and it gained a lot of attention with time. It also gained media attention, which was sincere and rather credible, to which Anne Royale can be accredited for, as she was the first Journalist who interviewed him regarding the matter by sitting on his clothes and refusing to get up until he answered her questions. Those were the good old days and nothing is the same. Would any journalists like to interview President Trump in a similar situation? Any takers?</p>     <h2>7. President Andrew Johnson’s speech</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1041.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>According to credible historical evidence, President Johnson partied a bit too hard on the night before being sworn in. Under the influence of alcohol, President Johnson’s drinking has been titled as very heavy and very celebratory. In the morning, he was still very hung over and he asked Vice President Hamlin for some whiskey so he could gather his strength. This cured him as nicely as extinguishing an open flame with Kerosene would, and he only got even more drunk. At the ceremony, President Johnson delivered an incredibly slurred and incomprehensible speech in front of the Senate for a solid 17 minutes and if that wasn’t bad enough, while being sworn in, he placed his hands on the Bible and said something along the lines of ‘I kiss this book in the face of my nation the United States’. Labeled a disgrace and titled unfit to be the face of the ‘States by certain Senators, Mr. Johnson couldn’t care less.</p> <h2>6. President George Washington grew marijuana</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1042.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>Before assuming office, President George Washington was a keen farmer and catered to meticulous detail when it came to his work. Taking his agricultural concerns seriously, President Washington was very observant of the fact that the tobacco market’s returns were unyielding and it was very unstable. Turning his attention to other crops, President Washington then started growing hemp. Now before you get any ideas, here’s a quick fact for you. Hemp was actually used back in the day to make fabrics, canvases and rope. Though smoking the Devil’s Cabbage wasn’t something that had never happened at the time, this man wasn’t on that bandwagon – or was he? In some excerpts taken from his writings, he has been recorded to note that he was too late in separating the male from the female hemp, and this is interesting because female hemp has more THC, which is what induces the high. President Washington though, wasn’t about his life and probably just wanted to separate the males and females for making stronger fiber and replanting respectively. Probably.</p> <h2>5. President James Buchanan’s sexuality</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1043.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>Today’s society is more accepting and tolerant than before, or we at least like to think so. With many countries having legalized homosexual marriages and recognizing it for what it is, this wasn’t always the case – not even in the same country. Though we’re not accusing President Buchanan of being homosexual, we’re saying we accept it if it’s true, with no strings attached. The only bachelor to ever become the President of the United States, President Buchanan may not have been single. There has always been a lot of speculation about his sexuality and this has only been made worse due to his close relationship with Alabama Senator William Rufus King. The two lived together for over a decade despite being able to afford their own homes, and President Andrew Jackson (most epic President) called them ‘Aunt Nancy and Miss Fancy’. President Buchanan was severely heartbroken when Senator King left for France in 1844 and wrote that he now lives in solitude. Is this to be decoded or taken as it is, perhaps we’ll never know.</p> <h2>4. President Thomas Jefferson’s stand on slavery</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1044.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>Historians have a very mixed approach on clarifying President Jefferson’s stance on slavery. President Jefferson owned a large plantation and had hundreds of slaves working on them, one of whom was Sally Hemmings. A lady of mixed ethnicity, she was actually the half-sister of his late wife. When posted as the Ambassador to France, he took the then 14-year-old with him and the two were always rumored to be a couple. The two lived together until his death and it was said that he was the father of her six children, four of which lived on. Subject to much controversy, the children’s families’ DNA Tests were conducted in 1998 and it was concluded that they shared a paternal match with President Jefferson’s own direct lineage.</p> <h2>3. President Calvin Coolidge’s Kink</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1045.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>Ah, nothing quite makes your morning like a nice and quiet breakfast in bed. Some crispy toast with raspberry jelly, some orange juice, a hot coffee ready to be served, maybe a fresh flower or two to make your morning fresh? And of course, who doesn’t like Vaseline being rubbed into their head as the warm coffee washes down the buttered croissant? Well, don’t freak out. President Coolidge was a man known for steadfast demeanor and rather gathered and collected presence, and of course, the Vaseline being rubbed into his head every morning, especially as he ate. We do admit it sounds weird, but is it? How about you have the honors, try it and let us know! We’ll say it was for science!</p> <h2>2. President Franklin and Fala</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1046.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>President Franklin D. Roosevelt loved his dog, and who can blame him? Fala was an adorable Terrier who the President insisted on being the sole caretaker of. The only one to feed and care for Fala, he even made Fala an honorary U.S. Army private during W.W.II! This affair was so popular with the press and American media in general that two movies were made on Fala and MGM designated a comic strip, just for the puppy! He is also the only pet ever to immortalized in a presidential memorial alongside his owner!</p> <h2>1. President Franklin and his family</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1047.jpeg"/>Wikimedia <p>While we’re discussing President Franklin, another interesting fact about him is his family tree. For starters, his wife didn’t have to change her last name after her marriage since the two were already cousins, and she was walked down the aisle by her uncle, President Theodore ‘Teddy’ Roosevelt! What more intriguing however, is that President F. Roosevelt was related to the Presidential couples Washington, both Adams, Madison, Van Buren, both Harrisons, Taylor, Grant and Taft. He was also related to Winston Churchill!</p>     <p>So, there you have it. Some wacky yet very true facts about U.S. Presidents we’re sure you didn’t know. Which one is your favorite?
