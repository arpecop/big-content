From the looks of these, humans will never be allowed to set foot there because they are too dangerous, too protected or too mysterious. Some of these have limited access and for other access has been completely blocked off with even the authorities not daring to go back there again. Even the most seasoned voyager better stay out because life is more important than adventure.</p> <h2>5. Snake Island, Brazil</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1137.jpeg"/>via imgur <p>Ilha da Queimada Grande, or Snake Island, is an island off the coast of Brazil. It is at approximately a distance of 20 miles from the Sao Paolo shore and is home to thousands of species of venomous snakes.</p> <p>It is one of the most dangerous islands in the entire world and is closed for public visitation. The island is unique in a sense because it is also home to the globe’s most deadly species of snakes called the Golden Lancehead Viper.</p> <p>These snakes are so venomous that their poison can eat through the human skin and flesh. It is believed that more than 4000 of these Golden Lanceheads inhabit the island.</p> <h2>4. The Sentinel Islands</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1138.jpeg"/>via Wikimedia <p>The North Sentinel Island is perhaps one of the most mysterious and isolated islands which still haven’t been visited by the modern humans. We say modern because the island is very well inhabited by what is believed to be between 50 to 500 local tribesmen who have lived here for almost 60,000 years, disconnected with the rest of the world.</p> <p>Located far into the Bay of Bengal, in the Indian Ocean, this island is roughly the size of Manhattan and is home to the Sentinelese tribe. The island shot to fame in 2006, after the tribesmen killed two fishermen near the island who tried to approach it illegally. According to Survival International, the tribe should be left alone because intervention could wipe out this tribe.</p> <p>They don’t have the immunity to modern viruses and diseases and their immunity system would not be able to withstand intervention of humans.</p> <p>Attempts of communication have been rejected with force and hostility by the tribe with them throwing arrows at low flying helicopters and assuming attack maneuvers whenever someone tries to approach the island. The Indian government has declared getting within 5 kilometeres of the island illegal.</p>     <h2>3. Chernobyl</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1139.jpeg"/>via imgur <p>Chernobyl was a bustling town with over 16,000 inhabitants in northern Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic which was part of the Soviet Union (USSR). But it all changed in 1986 when disaster struck in a nuclear reactor in Chernobyl.</p> <p>At first the Russian officials tried to hide the incident and people in the area were told only to bring one suitcase as they were evacuated with the idea that they would be returning soon.</p> <p>But the radiation was wrose than they believed, almost as much as 400 atomic bombs going off at once and radioactive clouds were detected as far as Sweden and the military of Soviet Union established an Extraction Zone; 18-miles all around the power plant. The city of Chernobyl is now a ghost town and one of the most radioactive areas in the world.</p> <h2>2.
