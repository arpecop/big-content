We think that they help us lead a healthy life and prevent us from contracting illnesses. However, this may not always be the case. In fact, we may be putting ourselves in greater danger by continuing this way.</p> <p>To help you detect some habits like these, we’ve listed some of them below. Be sure to do what it takes to tweak your daily routine in order to make it really healthy. You can begin by eliminating the following practices:</p> <h2>9. Sanitizing Our Way through Life</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1020.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Sheldon Cooper sure loves his sanitizer, and so do millions of mothers all over the country. We have hand sanitizers on the table in restaurants and in every corner within hospitals. It basically gets your hands clean without much fuss. That’s got to be good, right?</p> <p>The truthful answer is…not really. Hand sanitizers may contain triclosan, which could lower our resistance to antibiotics. The same goes for antibacterial soaps that claim to wipe out most of the bacteria on our hands. Hence, you may not want to sanitize your hands without looking at the brand and ingredients of the product used.</p> <h2>8. Getting the Latest Skincare Products</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1021.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Those of us who are conscious about our complexions may get tempted by every skincare ad out there. There are admittedly a lot, so we could end up paying a pretty penny for the sake of our skin every month. However, it turns out that using your face as a guinea pig for every new offering out there is extremely problematic.</p> <p>Sure, you have to do a bit of experimentation before you hit upon a combination that suits your skin. But when you find a good beauty regimen, it’s safe to stick with it in the long run. Remember, a skincare routine could take up to two months to show results. So do wait at least that long before updating your skincare range.</p> <p>If you change products on the regular, it could cause rosacea. This means inflamed and patchy skin, like the kind we mostly see in infants. Your skin would get sensitive even if it was hardy before.</p> <h2>7. Those Comfy Flip Flops</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1022.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Everyone knows that high heels and constricting shoes aren’t good for your feet. After a night of tottering in difficult shoes, it’s a relief to slip our feet into a pair of flip-flops. However, it may not be the healthiest decision, even if your feet do feel better just after the transfer.</p> <p>Flip-flops essentially have no such thing as arch support. Look at the base of your feet. Very few people have a completely flat surface there. You have the ball of your sole, along with the arch in the middle. Planting this non-flat surface into a flat sandal or flip-flop is only going to cause pain and discomfort. Foot experts are even of the opinion that this could lead to stress fractures.</p> <p>Plus, you have to constantly hold on to your flip-flops using your toes. This can cause its own share of problems. The solution is to get some comfortable casual sandals that have supportive styles. Offerings from companies like Mephisto and OrthoHelp may help in this case.</p> <h2>6. Brushing after Meals</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1023.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>We all know the drill. We should brush our teeth before and after every single meal. This is the usual rule of thumb we follow for our oral health. However, rushing off to brush just after downing a meal is not the best idea. The food we eat has acid in it, so our teeth are quite sensitive right after eating. This is especially true if we have fruit for dessert.</p> <p>Thus, brushing the weakened enamel could our teeth to weaken much faster. This is why the experts recommend only brushing twice a day. In the morning and just before bed are probably enough for anyone. What you can do is crush in circles. This will remove bad bacteria more effectively.</p>     <h2>5. Only Cardio Exercises</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1024.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Having a proper exercise routine is highly commendable. In the rush to lose weight, though, too many people look at their cardio exercise as the main goal. However, cardio alone would not let us burn fat for long. Eventually, our body would be getting used to the exercises and hence take less benefit from them.</p> <p>Repeating the same cardio exercises over and over again can tighten up the muscles. This increases the chances of injury. The solution is to punctuate the cardio with some circuit, weight, and strength training. This would not only make exercise more interesting, but more effective too. Your muscle mass would increase, which would allow more calorie burn in your everyday routine.</p> <h2>4. Saving Up Meals</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1025.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>It is tempting to skip a meal or two in favor of eating more later on. Females may especially be drawn towards this technique. They may feel ‘allowed’ to eat more in the evening if they forgo their breakfast and lunch. However, this is quite a disturbing trend and one that should be abolished right away.</p> <p>When you’re trying to lead a truly healthy lifestyle, it’s not just about counting calories. When we skip a meal, we can get cranky, faint, and a longing for food. This may cause us to become unproductive throughout the day and end up stress eating at night. It is much better to eat portion controlled and high protein meals throughout the day.</p> <h2>3. The Bottled Selection</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1026.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Tap water actually contains a lot of benefits, including fluoride. Bottle water contains no such thing. If your tap water is properly purified, don’t go for the bottled kind. The plastic in the bottles could change its quality and taste, especially on a hot day. Instead, fill up a BPA-free or glass bottle with some good old tap water and drink up!</p> <p>If you must buy bottled water, be sure to consume it quickly. Don’t leave it around to heat up. The resulting carcinogens are just not worth it.</p> <h2>2. Disinfecting Everything</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1027.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Too many proud housekeepers think that they are looking after their family’s health when they disinfect every surface. If they use antibacterial or disinfectant products, it’s considered a high form of care. Sadly, though, this may not be the case at all. Such products are usually no better than regular cleaners.</p> <p>Plus, disinfectants may contain certain chemicals that directly cause asthma. There may also be carcinogens and hormone disruptors involved. The really disturbing part is that cleaning products don’t even need to have a full ingredient list on their labels.</p> <p>The way out here would be to find an eco-friendly brand and stick with it. You may also try using natural cleaners such as baking soda and vinegar. Frequent cleaning is best, rather than one good scrub with possibly dangerous products.</p> <h2>1. Taking All the Vitamins</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1029.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Nutritional supplements have long been a part of our everyday routines. However, nutritionists are not really in much favor of these. Nutritional problems are actually quite rare, since we eat so many fortified foods now. Usually, nutritionist supplements can be ineffective at best and dangerous at worst.</p> <p>For instance, Vitamin A can harm an unborn child. Pregnant women should be especially careful of what they put into their bodies. Even if there is a vitamin or nutrient deficiency, many doctors recommend filling the gap the natural way. This would be changing your dietary habits, not adding more pills to your roster. You may try eating more spinach and drinking more milk for a start.</p> <p>If one must have supplements within their diet, it is best to use products with the letters “USP” on their labels. This assures the consumer that the contained pill has been tested by the U.S. Pharmacopeia. It is hence probably safe to swallow. Still, it is best not to be dependent on any kind of pill at all.</p>     <p>Some of the effects of the above habits may surprise you. We do learn new things every day when we are open to new information. Now go and use this valuable knowledge to your advantage!</p>   <i></i>
