Their thick layer of fur helps them survive in the freezing weather and makes them cuter and cuddlier. They’ve been blessing the land of Russia for more than a thousand years. They also are part of Russia’s folk culture. They prey on mice and rodents keeping them away from farms and stores of food. Alla Lebedeva too, is happy to have free protection from mice thanks to these cats. These friendly creatures have good relations with other farm animals as well as the farmer’s dog, Rikki.</p> <p>Anyone who owns a cat knows that cat obsession is real. You have more pictures of cats in your camera roll than having pictures of family. All of your Snaps are of kittens lying around in your house. Or eating. Or doing the most basic things but you still awe with admiration. Alla Lebedeva has a similar obsession. She and her husband, Sergey have been raising cats for over a decade. She is obsessed with filming them as the fat kindle strays around in her farm, camouflaged in snow. She has a YouTube channel dedicated to these cats, with more than two thousand people following and looking in wonderment at the videos. I mean, what’s a better way to waste time?</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1578.jpeg"/>imgur <p>Alla’s good photography paired with her photogenic four-legged friend’ pictures are literally perfect. From being playful and friendly to rough and independent these cats have stolen hearts of thousands of people. If your web history is always full of ‘cute cat pictures’ then look up these cat videos. You won’t be able to watch without exhaling ‘look, how adorable’ at least once. And if you’re having a bad time then you definitely need to check these Russian beauties. Guaranteed to make your day. Bored in office and timed won’t pass? Cat videos is the way to make it better, just try not to ‘awww’ out loud, your boss might not appreciate it.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1580.jpeg"/>imgur <p>She’s provides them place to stay, in return. ‘They live in the henhouse… hey have three “little bedrooms” where can they sleep according to how they feel.’ She tells DesignYouTrust. Her first cat was named Babushka gave birth to five ginger kittens in 2004. This is where it all started. Now, the couple’s home is flooded with the fuzzy creatures. The 59 year old farmer calls her home Koshlandia which means ‘land of cats’.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1582.jpeg"/>imgur <p>Alla likes to take distinctive pictures of her cats. Some as characters from famous TV shows such as Game of Thrones, some wearing Russian hats.</p>     <p>Alla’s cats are divided into two groups, ones like to stay home all year long and the wild ones, which go hunting all summer. The cats move about freely and come home as they wish. They’re different from domestic kitties living in apartments. They’re not grumpy and lazy like them. Rather they’re known for being athletic and spirited. They like their independence and are wild enough to hunt.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1584.jpeg"/>imgur <p>A couple of years ago the farmer discovered that pictures of her beloved pets were used on a website. The site did not give any credit to her. Moreover, the website was about Norwegian Forest Cats. The two species are easy to confuse because they’re covered in a similar fuzz coat. Internet provides you with information and pictures of almost everything in the world. Please try to incorporate the information properly and give credit where it’s due.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1586.jpeg"/>imgur <p>Siberian Cats have a three layered fur. This helps them adapt to the harsh weather of the North. Their triple layered coat is water repellent with medium to long hair. The tail is also bushy. The animal can weigh from 10-20 pounds, even 25 in some cases. Their average life expectancy is around 15 years. They’re formally called Moscow Semi-long hair. The cat’s hind legs are slightly longer than the front legs which allows them to jump higher. They don’t have a specific pattern or color. They come in all types of patterned fur such as tabby, solid, tortoiseshell and color point.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1587.jpeg"/>imgur <p>Cats are famous for being grumpy but that is not the case with Serbian cats. These cats have full control of everyone’s hearts with their fluff and playfulness. Even if you’re a dog person these cats got you. They are famous for their dog like features and traits. For example, these cats, unlike others won’t sit dead on the floor when you throw a ball. Instead they’ll go fetch it. They will also greet people at the door and respond when called. Every cat owner wishes their cats would be like that, too.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1588.jpeg"/>imgur <p>According to some sources one of the best thing about Siberian Forest cats is that they are found to have hypoallergenic qualities. That means you can own one as a pet and cuddle it all you want. But, there is no solid research and evidence to support this. Because allergies are caused by the dead skin cells that are shed by all cats, not type of fur coats.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1589.jpeg"/>imgur <p>Imagine a thousand icy fur balls roaming around you all day, all the time. How could you ever be unhappy? You wouldn’t even need to meet people as these cat take all your loneliness away.</p>     <p>And if you don’t like cats the paw-don me (see, what we did there) but you’re an emotionless felinophobe (cat hater). There’s a special place in hell for you to melt that ice cold heart. How could you not get lost in those pair of perfectly round eyes attached to a ball of fur, covered in snow, huh?</p>   <i></i>
