Myths</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-672.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>We have been listening to a plethora of myths and stories since we were young. Even in this 21st century, there are certain kinds of myths which we still choose to believe in. There are a lot of people who tend to talk about certain things including people, animals, food, and what not, related to which we have heard a lot of myths and misunderstood perceptions. In this article, we will go into the details of a lot myths and see how they can be proved wrong! I know this is super exciting. Let’s discover the hidden realities behind them and let’s see how much they will embarrass us to believe in them at all.</p> <h2>12. Blue Whale</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-673.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It is told by many people that blue whales are large and scary monsters and we do not even doubt about the way their size can be scary for many people. However, a myth claims that a blue whale can possibly swallow a car and may won’t even find it difficult at all. Well, that isn’t true at all. Since the truth is that it can possibly swallow the largest things which is a grapefruit.</p> <h2>11. Dogs and colours</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-674.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It is said to be believed by people that dogs are colours bling and can’t see the world with all its beautiful colours. Who can possibly make a dog blind just for the sake of making up a story? I don’t know who it can be in past, but I know one thing that this isn’t true since it is a myth. The astonishing truth is that they can see the world with its colours very clearly. Yes, they can!</p> <h2>10. Ostriches can runaway always…</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-675.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>A widely known myth is the perception about ostriches that they bury their heads instantly in the sand whenever they are feeling scared, frightened, or insecure. Listen to me carefully for the first and the last time. They can run away whenever they feel danger and they will run very fast. You can’t even imagine so please stop believing in this myth or they may even catch you! Lol.</p> <h2>9. Elephants walk silently unlike you!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-676.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Whenever people are talking to someone about the way they are creating noise and it is annoying them to a great extent, so they often relate this action with the way elephant walks and makes noise consistently. That isn’t true since elephants are silent beings unlike you! They do not make any noise when they are walking or passing by. They walk with absolute silence and do not bother their mates around them.</p> <h2>8. Bulls</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-677.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It is believed by many people since a long time that bulls react angrily toward the color red and the mystery remains unknown as a lot of stories and perceptions prevail in the society and mindset of the people. This is an incorrect perception since bulls get provoked by any movement made around them or in front of their eyes. They get pushy because of the movements not because of the color red.</p>     <h2>7. Pistol and silence</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-678.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>While watching movies a lot of myths are beings believed and spread. It is said that a pistol which is accompanying a suppressor does not make any noise and can be used with silence. However, this is not right as the pistol with the suppressor may decrease the noise, but it can still be heard by the people around when the gun if fired.</p> <h2>6. Shooting and effectiveness</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-679.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>In many movies, heroes are fighting with their enemies by taking a gun and shooting at two targets which appears to be very effective and on point. This is a myth and nothing else. It is not possible for people to shoot two people and target them effectively. After all, James borne is also a human being, right? He is not a supernatural being…</p> <h2>5. Heart beat and its revival</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-680.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It is believed by watching many dramatic films that heartbeats can be revived by making use of the defibrillator and the person may still live on just for the sake of that ‘happy ending’ which the audience would love to see. However, even these films can’t reverse the reality since it is a myth and the truth is that defibrillator can’t work again after the hearty beat has stopped. Sad ending, right?</p> <h2>4. Parachute jump</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-681.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Movies take us in a fantasy that doesn’t exist in the real world. It is believed and seen on the movies that during a parachute jump two people can talk to each other very clearly however that isn’t true at all. It is so because the other person may not hear the one who is talking at all. The extreme pressure of the wind makes it impossible for someone to hear or talk properly.</p> <h2>3. Brain and myths</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-682.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It is believed that humans only make use of the ten percent of tehri brains which isn’t true at all. Brain is quite an exceptional part of a human being which works actively even when a person is sleeping and watching all those dreams. Surprising, right? Same here!</p> <h2>2. Eyesight</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-683.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It is said by many people that one should not read that much from the internet since it may deteriorate your eye sight increasingly and damage them. However, that isn’t true either. The reality is that eyes get tired after reading a lot form the internet but may work properly and get better with time if you get sufficient rest. That’s all. No big deal so read and take rest. That simple it is.</p> <h2>1. Split ends</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-684.jpeg"/>Shutterstock     <p>Please stop believing that split ends can be improved and finished by conditioners or shampoos. No, it is a myth! You may remove your split ends effectively by cutting them and trimming your hair regularly. There is no other way. Trust me!</p>   <i></i>
