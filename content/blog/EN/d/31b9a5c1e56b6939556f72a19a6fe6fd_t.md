Being in a breakup really blows! Not only does it affect your emotional stability, but there’s a lot of sense made in saying every aspect of life is hit pretty bad and that’s how it is for almost all of us. We here know it isn’t exactly the most comfortable position to be in, but we can’t pass you the tissue papers. Actually, we’ve brought some very helpful ways in which you can get over a breakup and be back up on your feet again! Read on to find out!</p> <h2>7. Maintain distance</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1402.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Even if your ex and you decide to remain friends, or at least in touch after the breakup, it’s proven to be helpful to cut off any kind of communication with them immediately after the breakup. This means no calls, messages or meetings. Compared to slowly having your communications fade, it’s better to go cold turkey and not talk at all. This is helpful in them not popping up in your mind every now and then and causing your mental state to go south. If you communicate, chances are that you’ll be reminded of certain times which might have you caught in the moment for longer than is good for you.</p> <p>For practical purposes however, especially if you lived together, have a neutral third party attend to matters which would otherwise require the two of you to meet. You’ll be sorted soon.</p> <h2>6. Get a breath of fresh air</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1403.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>All this steam you two have been blowing off is bound to make you suffocate! If suffering the after effects of a break up, head out with friends or colleagues and just try to have a good time! Consider going to your favorite coffee place or watch a movie, or maybe take the guys out bowling? It doesn’t always have to be so gloomy and dark. If going out isn’t your thing, you can just kick back and unwind at your own place. Slip into something really comfortable, throw your feet up and just chill for a bit. Take a mini-vacation, you can really use one right about now!</p> <h2>5. Terminate those triggers</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1404.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>There’s many little things that pile up, or should we say snowball, into one big force which can bring down your walls. These things help you know your liking for someone has taken a new turn and you are now in love. This could be a certain perfume, maybe a song or perhaps a television show? Maybe it’s that one restaurant you see on your way from work which reminds you of your ex. While you can’t ask the manager to fire the staff and go out of business (even if you say please), what you can do is change your route!</p> <p>This applies for everything we’ve mentioned in this list and more. If anything reminds you of them, just ignore or avoid them – and if you can’t, just put it away. For now.</p>     <h2>4. Say no to rebound relationships</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1405.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>While it may be tempting to enter into a new relationship right after your breakup, you’ve been warned – don’t fall for it! Rebound relationships are becoming increasingly common. As a matter of fact, we’ll call them notorious. This is because right after there’s a void that’s been created, it’s only human nature to fill it up quickly. Maybe you want someone to talk to, someone to go out with? That is very understandable, but take note that right after a breakup, you’re never in your right mind and you’re so weak, emotionally, that you’re willing to cry on any shoulder at all. If that person doesn’t realize this and isn’t going to exploit you for this afterwards (probably never going to happen), it’s you who’ll seek liberation when you’re recovered.</p> <p>And then you’ll have to experience two breakups at one time. Yay? Nay.</p> <h2>3. Anger management</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1406.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>What about us who have genuinely been wronged, we hear you cry. Well you see, we know that at times things aren’t working out simply because you might be continuously dealt a bad hand. It happens, and it’s only human nature to get mad at either your partner or even yourself. The key here is to calm down and not get mad. There’s no point in crying over spilt milk and hey – you should be glad you guys split up before more damage could have been done! Take deep breaths and maybe put on some light music. De-stress: it’s the best.</p> <h2>2. Better off without you</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1407.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>No matter how many fond memories you have with them. No matter how many smiles you’ve shared, there’s more or less always going to be something about them that was stopping you from doing your thing, and the sooner you realize it, the better! Remember that time you really wanted to have your hair streaked red but he didn’t let you?</p> <p>Do you remember that time you really wanted to invest in crypto-currency but she really put up a fight calling it a sham? Well, now’s your chance to do your thing!</p> <h2>1. No pain, no gain</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1409.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>No we’re not hinting at the fact that you should see The Rock’s action thriller, we’re saying that a diamond is just coal that had to deal with a lot of pressure! You may find your peace in comfort food, intoxicants, movies or taking a few days off of work, but those aren’t long term solutions, are they? Your cabinets will eventually run out of chips and the freezer will bear the bad news of no ice cream at one point or another sooner or later! What’s best is that you take this time to build a new hobby – something that’ll take your mind off of all these things that give you added tensions.</p>     <p>So sign up for that spin class you’ve wanted to since so long, and order that hobby aircraft you Google again and again. You practically know all the stats by heart by now anyways! Don’t be too hard on yourself and just take it easy. Don’t forget to breathe! We wish you all the very best in this trying and testing time and hope our methods help you. Let us know!</p>   <i></i>
