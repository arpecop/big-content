Your sleeping patterns, habits and ways can affect your relationship a lot. It tells a lot about your connection with your significant other.

The quality of sleep also affects it, so the more you have a good night sleep the more you are going to be fresh the next day.</p> <h2>5.       I think we need to talk</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1800.jpeg"/>@shutterstock <p>It is a very important sign to notice in someone you want to spend your life with. Are you comfortable around them? Do you like to talk to them? Do you like to share your stories with them? Are you being afraid of getting judged? Talking your heart out to the person you love is always a good sign. It means that they value you and your perspective. You both have an effective communication and you tend to hear each other, understand what’s wrong and what’s bugging your soulmate. And it is just not the talks. If you take big life decisions together. You discuss your deep-rooted fears and goals, you are a perfect couple.</p>     <h2>6.       Equality</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1801.jpeg"/>@shutterstock <p>Do you feel like you are the only one making the effort to make things work? There should always be an equality in the relationships. If there isn’t then you are in for a sloppy path. Making decisions together, respecting each other’s choices and not pushing hard or pressurizing in a relationship never works. Respect is the key to a successful connection.</p> <p>Try to link up with someone who has your mindset and is on the same levels as you are. Even if he is a prince charming and you are his Cinderella, he should consider you his equal, he should never treat you as your stepmother and sisters did.</p> <h2>7.       A Gem</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1802.jpeg"/>@shutterstock <p>Don’t ever talk rubbish about your partner in front of your friends and if you do that means you are not with the right person. Because if they are your happily ever after, you wouldn’t find anything bad in them enough to say in front of your friends. The couples who are proud on their partner’s achievements and praise them in front of their family and friends are most likely to keep a lasting relation. This tells that you are completed and wholesome. Your relationship doesn’t lack anywhere.</p> <h2>8.       Live, life, love</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1804.jpeg"/>@shutterstock <p>This is nothing new but if you love having fun with your partner and you both have similar interest. Your relationship will surely last forever.  It depends totally on you and your partner’s creativity. If they can change a boring family dinner into a fun night, then you have found your addiction. Sharing similar goals, similar tastes in music and lifestyle will affect the longevity of your relationship.</p> <p>The more you get cozy and comfortable around them the merrier it is. Just snuggling on the sofa with hot chocolate and your bae can make a memorable night. It is good to have someone who is fun for the rest of your life. Try to ignite the love with weekly date nights and long drives.</p> <h2>9.       I am here to help</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1806.jpeg"/>@shutterstock <p>You should always consider your partner as a helper. You can talk to them in stress and they will help you find the way out. If you have one, then you have a keeper. Don’t ever lose them. If in your crisis they stand tall without, then they surely would stay with you in the problems you might face in the future. We know it is hard to ask for help and you might feel weak and ashamed but that’s not the case if they are your partners forever.</p> <p>They will understand you completely and not judge you on petty things. It will also portray that you have given them enough respect to ask for help. It means that they will be happy that you think they have the solution to your problems.</p> <p>Even if they don’t have it, try sharing your sorrow with them, they will be obliged, and you will be free from the burden. It also gives them a feeling of trust, they will know that you trust them enough to share your secret with them and trust is the most important part of a relationship.</p> <h2>10.   I trust you babe.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1808.jpeg"/>@shutterstock <p>Last but not the least, having complete faith in your loved one is the essential part of your relationship. Having shaky trust can break perfect marriages. Trust has diverse types in a relationship such as if you can communicate easily with your partner. It can also be that you don’t have to put passwords on your phones and accounts, you shouldn’t be afraid of your partner snooping in.</p>     <p>This speaks for itself as you both are on a mutual understanding of trust and not invading each other’s privacy. It’s good when you trust them with their friends. It is wrong to force someone and box them up alone. Possessiveness can be cute, but selfishness isn’t good. Having zero trusts in a relationship would never work.</p>   <i></i>
