In a brave and bold move 17 year old, decided that there was absolutely no reason for her to hide her beautiful bald head. She decided she would flaunt her bald head and asked her mother to do a photo shoot.</p>  <p></p>   <p>Happy Senior Sunday from this little ball of sunshine!!! 💛</p> <p>Posted by Chelsea Taylor Photography on Sunday, October 15, 2017</p>  <p>Madisyn Babcock wanted to raise awareness about the problem of baldness caused by such diseases as alopecia. The brave young woman who is a native of the state of Kansas said that her she took this bold decision in order to “reclaim the beauty that society sometimes takes away from those with hair loss”.</p> <p>The resulting photos are nothing short of absolutely stunning and leaves one lost for words. The shoot was done by photographer Chelsea Taylor.</p> <p>“I was truly astonished when I saw the results,” the brave teenager told the media.</p>  <p></p>   <p>This is Madisyn Babcock. This is one of her senior portraits. She has alopecia and she decided to paint her head to…</p>     <p>Posted by Persimmon Salon on Tuesday, November 14, 2017</p>  <p>With regards to the flowers painted on her head Madisyn Babcock said that “It wasn’t about filling some kind of void or signifying that there’s something missing from those with hair loss, it was to embrace and embellish it.”</p> <p>Seventeen year old Madysin Babcock began to suffer from alopecia areata earlier this year. The disease leads to hair loss yet it does not leave any scars. At first she was badly shaken and her self confidence plummeted rapidly and her confidence took a terrible beating.</p> <p>“It’s perfectly natural to be scared and feel less confident,” Madysin went on to say, she went on to continue and said that “There’s no right or wrong way to react to losing your hair”.</p> <p>“I think going through a sad stage is needed to come out stronger.” She said about her experience with hair loss.</p> <p>After the initial mourning subsided, she began to look to the future. She was about to graduate from high school and in a time honored tradition she would also have her senior portraits done.</p> <p>“I’d been seeing other courageous girls with hair loss around the internet and I just got to thinking about how sometimes we are hidden and thought less of than girls who do have hair,” Madisyn went on to say.</p> <p>So she decided to have a photo shoot in which her bald head would feature prominently. It was a brave and bold attempt to challenge stereotypical beauty standards being promoted generally in society at large.</p> <p>“I had been thinking about what I wanted to do to my head for senior portraits for a long time,”  she goes on to tell</p> <p>“I thought it would be really cool to use this opportunity to raise awareness and reclaim the beauty [that] society sometimes takes away from those with hair loss.</p> <p>“I want those with hair loss to know that you’re beautiful, I love you and you inspire me.”</p> <p>For Madisyn Babcock her mother painting her head was something very powerful and deeply emotional. She said that for her it was symbolic of the fact that her mother had constantly stood by her every step of the way and did not once abandon or demean her daughter.</p> <p>Madisyn Babcock went on to say that “Losing your hair changes your life. It may seem small, but when it happens to you it’s a whole new perspective on life. Because of this, my biggest advice is to surround yourself [with] people who help you feel beautiful.</p> <p>“Most importantly, I want those who suffer from hair loss to know that they do have someone to talk to. I know this would have helped me immensely. My DMs are open.”</p>     <p>Her experience is deeply moving and inspiring for all people suffering from body image issues. We are all proud of her.</p>   <i></i>
