The young girl from Tehran, believed to be 19 years old, caused frenzy online when her Instagram images went viral a few weeks ago.</p> <p>The photos showed her in a rather anorexic state having sharp and pointed cheekbones with sunken cheeks and large lips, all in an alleged attempt to look like her idol Angelina Jolie. When these photos emerged a couple of weeks ago, it was reported that Sahar had undergone no less than 50 plastic surgeries and lost as much as 40 kilograms to be able to look like the Hollywood A-lister.</p> <h2>About Sahar</h2>      <p> سلام دوستان🌷 این ساعتیکه رو دستم میبیند از گالری میراکو خریدم، قیمتاشون خیلی خوبه از کیفیتشم خیلی خیلی راضیم اصلا ساعتو از دستم در نمیارم بس که دوسش دارم، پیشنهاد من به شما اینه حتما به پیجشون سر بزنید. اگه دنبال هدیه یلدا یا ولنتاین خودتون میگردید بهترین گزینست🌷👌 @Miraco_laand ☟ ☟ ☟ @Miraco_laand راستی هزینه ارسال هم ‌نمیگیرن خیلی هم به موقع ساعتو رسوندن بهم👌✔ ☟ ☟ ☟ @Miraco_laand @miraco_laand</p> <p>A post shared by  sahar tabar (@sahartabar_official) on Dec 19, 2017 at 10:56am PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Little else seems to be known about this latest social media celebrity of sorts. There have been conflicting reports with regard to her age as well, with different sources claiming her age to be 19, 22, and even 29 in some cases. It also begs the question that, if true, just how was this young girl able to afford all those surgical procedures, considering that plastic surgery is not exactly the cheapest of treatments out there.</p> <h2>Public Response</h2>      <p> تـؤ کِ مـی خواسـتئ بِرئ ، چِرا گُفتئ دوسِت دارَم..!💔</p> <p>A post shared by  sahar tabar (@sahartabar_official) on Dec 12, 2017 at 11:28am PST</p>   <p></p> <p>On the whole, the response to her viral photos has been quite negative, to say the least. Support has come from some quarters, but the majority of people have been highly critical of her supposed antics and obsession. Comparisons have been made to an extra on the set of <em>Walking Dead, </em>while some have likened her appearance to animated characters like Tim Burton’s <em>Corpse Bride </em>and <em>Yzma</em> from <em>The Emperor’s New Groove.</em></p> <p>However, the overwhelming majority of comments and opinions about her have been negative and full of criticism (including being called a “zombie”), with the occasional supportive statement in between. Also, one has to keep in mind that in this day and age of Internet and social media, fake news and fraudulent claims spread far quicker than conclusive facts. And it did not take long for people to start questioning the authenticity of claims regarding Ms. Tabar’s appearance.</p> <p>Many are convinced that the Instagram images of the Iranian are simply a combination of makeup and good photo editing skills. Others see it as simply a publicity stunt, which is not exactly a shot in the dark when you consider that Ms. Tabar has about 447,000 followers on Instagram. However, it is unclear whether her unusual photos are the result of this many followers or whether she could boast of such numbers before her images went viral.</p> <h2>Appearance Prior to Surgery</h2>      <p> به بهشت رفتن مهم نیست ! انسان بودن و به بهشت رفتن مهم است</p> <p>A post shared by  sahar tabar (@sahartabar_official) on Sep 30, 2017 at 4:16am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Before her extreme transformation, Ms. Tabar seems to have had a pretty simple and natural appearance, sporting cropped brown hair with brown eyes and normal sized lips. But now she wears greyish blue contact lenses in her eyes and after having had a nose job and liposuction, her cheeks look a lot more sunken with two piercings on them. In short, she looks rather anorexic and a freaky version of her supposed idol Angelina Jolie.</p> <p>While many have been critical of her photos and appalled that a fan could go to such lengths to emulate the look of her idol, others are not convinced at all. They consider the images to be photo-shopped and have called Ms. Tabar’s antics as nothing more than a gimmick for publicity and attention.</p> <h2>Clarification</h2>      <p> &quot;ما ز یاران چشم یاری&quot; ز آغاز بسته بودیم</p> <p>A post shared by  sahar tabar (@sahartabar_official) on Oct 22, 2017 at 10:54am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Amid all the hype, Ms. Tabar has now spoken out denying that she underwent 50 surgeries and has also refuted claims she ever wanted to look like Angelina Jolie. She put that resemblance down to mere coincidence. She did, however, admit to having had a nose job, enlarged mouth, and liposuction. Further clarification was provided by claiming that her strange and unusual appearance was due to makeup and photo editing.</p> <p>Ms. Tabar did admit to having undergone a few surgical procedures to alter her appearance, but did not put a number on those surgeries. However, she categorically rejected claims that she underwent 50 plastic surgeries in an attempt to look like Angelina Jolie. While she did confess to being a “big” fan of the <em>Lara Croft: Tomb Raider</em> actress, she claimed that her resemblance to the Hollywood A-lister was just coincidence.</p>     <h2>Criticism of Media Reporting</h2>      <p> هيچوقت باختنو نكردم باورش..!❤️</p> <p>A post shared by  sahar tabar (@sahartabar_official) on Oct 27, 2017 at 7:47am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Ms. Tabar took to Instagram to reach out to her 447,000 followers and clear the air once and for all. She talked about how international media outlets had been biased and inaccurate in reporting her story to the world. Different Iranian and international news agencies had reported on the story claiming that she would go to any lengths to be able to look like Angelina Jolie.</p> <p>As per her own words, “One would think these people probably live in the stone ages and do not know anything about how modern technology and makeup trends work. They seem utterly bewildered.” She slammed the shoddy reporting of the whole affair, from the conflicting reports about her age to the exaggerated claims about her number of plastic surgeries.</p> <h2>Instagram Statement</h2>      <p> بزرگترین خوشبختی این است ؛ که مارا بخاطر خودمان و برای آنچه واقعا هستیم دوست بدارند …</p> <p>A post shared by  sahar tabar (@sahartabar_official) on Oct 25, 2017 at 11:59am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Ms. Tabar’s full post, which was originally in Persian, went something like this, “To all my dear followers and well-wishers, I wish to set the record straight with regard to a number claims circulating about me and my appearance. First and foremost, I only underwent a small number of surgical procedures to alter my appearance and the media’s claim that I had 50 plastic surgeries is wide off the mark.”</p> <p>Her post further said, “In particular, the way foreign news and media outlets had reported the whole story was quite biased and misleading. One would think these people probably live in the stone ages and do not know anything about how modern technology and makeup trends work. They seem utterly bewildered.”</p> <h2>General View</h2>      <p> عزیزم تو الماسی هیچ کس نمیتونه بشکندت..!</p> <p>A post shared by  sahar tabar (@sahartabar_official) on Nov 9, 2017 at 2:51am PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Whether one believes in the media’s earlier claims regarding 50 plastic surgeries or gives more weight to the clarification provided by Ms. Tabar, what is certain is that her photos are not just a result of surgical procedures that she has undergone. There are very strong possibilities that her images are a depiction of her great photo editing and makeup skills.</p> <p>In fact, if Ms. Tabar’s words are to be believed, the more plausible explanation is that her images are a result of great photo-shop work and good makeup skills. Whatever the case may be, her transformation has nevertheless been startling and unusual.</p> <p>And a head-scratching moment for a lot of people who just cannot understand the need to alter a perfectly fine appearance either for the sake of publicity or out of an obsession with some showbiz star.</p> <h2>Widespread Confusion</h2>      <p> سلام ب فالورای نسبتا عزیز این عکسو ک با دقت مشاهده می فرمایید بااینکه دوست نداشتم ب اشتراک گذاشتم و این عکس ب روز و چهره من هست باید بگم من فقط ی عمل جراحی داشتم نه 50عمل و سایتا و کانالای خارجی خیلی مغرضانه راجب عکسای من صحبت کردن من فکر کردم اینا احتمالا در قرن هیجدهم دارن زندگی می کنن واز تکنولوژی و گریم اصلا ن دیدن نه شنیدن واقعا تعجب می کنن ی سری پیجای ضد شاخ راجب من و خانوادم حرفایی گفته شده نشونه حسادت و شعله ور کردن حسادت و دامن زدن ب شایعات هستن دوستان عزیز همینطور ب دیگران تهمت می زنید بیرحمانه قَضاوت می کنی شک نکن در مسیر زندگیت تو و خانوادت ب چالش قضاوت و تهمت گرفتار میشید و ب زودی اسم سحر تبر نه به این صورت ک شما فکر می کنید بلکه اسم هنری و جهانی خواهد شد بعضیها خیلی پشیمون خواهند شد از حرفای نسنجیده لطفا ب سلیقه هم احترام بزارید وحواستون ب خودتون باشع ک یادتون نره کی هستید</p> <p>A post shared by  sahar tabar (@sahartabar_official) on Nov 28, 2017 at 6:43am PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Despite the apparent clarification issued by Ms. Sahar Tabar, lots of confusion still seems to be persisting. There has been lots of criticism on her depiction of a gaunt and skinny woman, and critics have slammed her for trying cheap and dangerous methods to gain publicity and followers on social media.</p> <p>In any case, if the aim indeed was to gain some instant attention and publicity, then this ploy of hers certainly worked out quite well. She was hugely successful in making people sit up and take notice of her unusual appearance. And if her goal was to shock the world and make headlines, then that was achieved quite successfully.</p> <p>However, as she has now come out and said, her story has been misrepresented in the media with “outrageous claims” regarding her surgical procedures and weight loss. As is often the case in stories such as this, gaining attention is not that difficult compared to getting the truth about your story out.</p>     <p>Media outlets often stop at nothing to get their hands on stories that have the potential to attract more viewers to their offerings. However, this often means that fact-checking and proper verification of the story takes a back seat in this race for more viewership. If Mr. Tabar feels that her story has been misrepresented and the truth of it has been left behind, then the news and media outlets have not really bothered to address the matter.</p>   <i></i>
