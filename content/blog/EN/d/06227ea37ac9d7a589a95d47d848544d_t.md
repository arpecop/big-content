For all of those women out there who are under the ruthless regime of a large bust, this article is definitely for you. You will relate with every point and some realizations will just make you cringe from the physical agony. From the coupling of multiple sport bras to being deprived of petite or strapless bras in these hot sticky summers, the list of nagging problems go on and on. Yet, here we are to save the day yet again with some critical info that is bound to save you some of the trouble of having this large bust. With a few hacks and workarounds, you will overcome the pain in no time and love yourself to the fullest, because hey! That is what matters most at the end of the day.</p> <h2>Staircases seem like an absolute nightmare</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2234-1-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>When your chest is on the larger side, walking down the stairs can be an absolute nightmare. Not only are you extremely uncomfortable physically, but the self-consciousness you feel when people point and whisper just adds to your misery. All this hassle couples with the strain you feel on your lower back if you climb too many stairs is enough to make you reach for the elevator! However, an easier way to combat your problem might be by wearing bras that offer more support and comfort, to aid you through the day. No one should be unable to do what they want just because of their body type!</p> <h2>Button down shirts are an absolute no</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2234-2-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Button down shirts are almost impossible for busty girls to get right. Anything that fits your body well is going to be too small for your chest, making buttons pop off leaving wide unsightly gaps. If you go up a few sizes, the shirt does not fit the rest of your body well, making you look frazzles at best. This makes it incredibly hard to rock a chic professional look. However, it can also mean that you get to experiment with your style more. Invest in some blouses and a good midi skirt, and you have a look that can be dressed up or down depending on your need.</p> <h2>Being confident</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2234-3-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>We all grow up associating a certain type of body with what we consider beautiful. Because of societal pressures, all of us find ways to believe that our body is as far from what is considered beautiful as can be. While being confident in your daily life can be difficult, it sure is rewarding. You need to remind yourself always, that the body you were born with is beautiful in itself and you have no reason to be ashamed of it, or try to hide it away. If you got it, flaunt it!</p> <h2>Strapless anything is a nightmare</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2234-4-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Strapless bras will never give your girls the support and lift they need, making you go through your day feeling uncomfortable. This means that you can either rock your strapless dress with an unsightly bra or just skip the ordeal entirely. However, many other styles compliment your natural body type. Go for something that is cinched at the waist and you’ll have an hourglass figure to die for! Embrace your curves and stop being afraid of trying new things.</p> <h2>The constant staring</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2234-5-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>The constant stares people keep pinning you with make you uncomfortable in the least. You feel naked and exposed even when fully covered. While this treatment is not fair to say in the least, you have no control over how people behave. On the other hand, what you can do is rise above the hate and not let their negativity affect your vibe. Society is never happy and its beauty standards are always changing. Nothing can ever be good enough or pretty enough. So put something sexy on and let the haters hate on!</p> <h2>Good luck fitting into a cute Bralette</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2234-6-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Just like strapless bras, sporting a cute bralette is more or less out of the question. Bralettes are too delicate and dainty to offer you the support you need to carry on with your day. With so many cute bralette options on display wherever you go, it seems heartbreaking that you will probably never find one to wear throughout the day comfortably. While this may be hard to accept, several stores are coming up with alternatives for heavier women that you would do well to look into. Who knows, your bralette rocking days might be just around the corner.</p> <h2>The demon that is boob sweat</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2234-7-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Girls with smaller chests are truly blessed in the essence that they never have to worry about a nuisance known as boob sweat. When you have a larger chest, it can be a pain to be constantly worried about walking around with wet patches on your body. While you can try steering clear of plain clothes in favor of patterned one’s, baby powder is an amazing product to soak up the sweat even before it makes an untimely appearance.</p> <h2>Having to wear two sports bras</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2234-8-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Having to wear two bras while working out is a big enough hassle to make you reconsider it entirely. While it feels great to have some momentary relief from the constant back pains, the tight and uncomfortable feeling can be very constricting. What you can do to help you with your problem is to research more about brands that cater specifically to your body type. A specialized bra is what will truly give you the support you need when working out. A few misses and you’re eventually bound to find one that works perfectly for you!</p> <h2>Looking too suggestive</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2234-9-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>People constantly accuse you of trying too hard and looking too suggestive. Just because your body looks, a certain way does not mean that you are asking for it. While it is frustrating and degrading to be constantly belittled to just a bra size, you need to keep a clear head as lashing out will only increase the problem. While a good talking to, laden with thinly veiled sarcasm might work a few times, in the longer run, it is futile to fight where it isn’t necessary. Just remember that it is your body and only you get to decide how to look, and what to do with it!</p>     <h2>No cute bras to be found</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2234-10-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>It is not just bralettes and strapless dresses you can’t find to wear; it is bras everywhere. When you have a large chest, your main concern in finding a bra is one that supports your girls. Companies that offer supportive bras don’t focus on the aesthetics at all, meaning you are stuck wearing old granny bras. However, the good news is that the fashion industry is slowly getting more inclusive, meaning newer designs now come in enough sizes to cater to a large chunk of the market.</p> <h2>Guys talking to your chest instead of you</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2234-11-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>We have all had to deal with a guy constantly sneaking looks at our chest when he thinks we were not paying attention. While a few glances are anything if not human, the constant ogling makes you feel like the other person is only interested in you based on what you look like. While it might seem easier to ignore than confront, you should never stand for such belittling behavior and call him out for it immediately. If you don’t speak up, you are part of the problem rather than the solution.</p> <h2>A constantly sore back</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2234-12-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>If you have a large chest, chances are you know that back pain is your only constant companion.

If you are just stepping into the world of fitness, it might be a good idea to invest in a good coach to teach you the ropes, before you decide to fly solo.</p> <h2>The constant inquiries about your bra size</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2234-14-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Whenever someone asks you your size, you want to either roll your eyes or poke theirs out. It is not just the fact that this question is a severe intrusion into your privacy, but it also makes you feel violated. It is something personal, and no one has the right to ask you about your body. Ignore the comments the first few times around, however, if the inquiries are redundant, shut that person down as rudely as you can. They should never even think about asking anyone this again!</p> <h2>Finding the right bikini</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2234-15-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>And don’t even get us started on the pains of nailing that summer dress to go to the beach.
