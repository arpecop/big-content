Sure, your partner might be doing a certain something which you find more pleasurable than other certain some things but never once does your brain think, “I love that my vagina has such heightened sensation due to increased blood flow down there.” The brain doesn’t tend to think a lot while having sex and instead lets your emotions and feelings take over.</p> <p>This process which your body goes through from being turned ‘on’ to reaching an orgasm is called ‘sexual-response cycle’. Loosely explained, it is a simultaneous and continuous sequence of 5 events beginning from when you are sexually aroused to a blissfully exhausting out ‘come’.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-99.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>While you cannot point out exactly where on phase ends and the other begins as it is a continuous stream of heightened emotions and sensations one after another. “It’s this symphony of activity,” explains Jamil Abdur-Rahman, M.D., OBGYN and chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Vista East Medical Center in Waukegan, Illinois.</p> <h2>5. Desire aka the part when you want to get it on!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-100.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>This phase was not originally included in the sexual-response cycle put forward by Masters and Johnson who coined the term. However, modern researches and studies suggested a slightly different sexual-response cycle for women including desire as one of the phases as well.</p> <p>“The original Masters and Johnson definitions were based around a male paradigm, where ‘arousal’ was all that was needed,” explains Dr. Steve McGough, associate professor of clinical sexology at the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality, “More recent models differentiate for women by introducing the concept of desire, or the mental state that is related to attraction and [the] wish for sexual activity.”</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-3.gif"/>vh1 via giphy <p>Desire is different for different women. While some women find desire a responsive behavior meaning it is in response to a stimulating factor, “… many women do experience spontaneous desire the way it’s portrayed in the media, as couples ripping each other’s clothes off after a single sexy glance,” explains sex therapist Ian Kerner, Ph.D., author of She Comes First. Either way, it is completely a normal behavior.</p> <h2>4. Excitement aka the phase where it is so very ON!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-101.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>The story of this phase starts unraveling with increased blood flow. After around 2o to 30 seconds into action aka erotic stimulation aka hanky panky or whatever your preferred term is, your body starts to undergo the following changes:</p>  The heart starts beating faster causing a climb in heart rate and blood pressure. You might feel a bit warm around the cheeks, neck and chest and depending on your skin color you might be able to spot these areas getting slightly ‘flushed’. “Women tend to have slight swelling of the clitoris, vulva, and vagina,” says McGough, “Women often produce lubrication, but the amount varies.” All this increased blood flow brings the star of our show, the clitoris, jumping into action which becomes ‘erect’ as it fills up with blood.  <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-4.gif"/>starz via giphy  A phenomenon called ‘tenting’ happens in which your vaginal open near the cervix relaxes and opens up more than usual while the area underneath it tightens up a bit. According to Dr. Abdur-Rahman this happens because “[it] may make it easier for the vagina to receive a penis, and it creates a sort of suctioning action that helps direct sperm to the cervix”. Most women’s breasts also begin to swell during this stage, thanks to excess blood flow and can increase in size by an astounding 25%, according to Britain’s NHS. Nipples also get erect and might feel more sensitive to touch, among other things. Tell your partner to feel free to go exploring. It will only get better from here, trust us. Your muscles will slowly begin to tense as buildup to an eventual orgasm.  <h2>3. Plateau aka the phase where it is so wonderfully on you don’t want it to stop. Ever.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-102.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>This phase is marked by a “prolonged, intense sexual arousal,” says Planned Parenthood. Everything that you had been feeling earlier tends to get more intense in plateau. It could happen while you are having sex or if you are still in the foreplay stage and this is what it is doing to your body:</p>      Activity in the pleasure centers of the brain increases and there is a hike in the feel-good hormones aka dopamine and epinephrine aka adrenaline. “The more aroused women get, the more parts of the brain associated with anxiety shut down,” says Kerner and explains that this is a key part towards orgasm. Adrenaline makes sure you have enough energy for all the on-going action and with dopamine it also ensures that, “… blood flow is being directed to the areas that are most important for sexual activity, like skeletal muscles, which help with voluntary movements like thrusting,” says Abdur-Rahman.  <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-5.gif"/>wifflegif via giphy  The outer walls of vagina swell and open up as the lips get puffier. The lips also change color but you might not have noticed that since you are probably too busy with other things at that moment. This phase has the most heightened sensitivity for the clitoris and it will most likely retract under the vaginal hood to avoid being over-stimulated. According to NHS, the clitoris “pulls back against the pubic bone and seems to disappear”. Your muscles will begin to spasm as you are nearing orgasm at this point and vagina will become generously lubricated for ‘action’ to be carried on without a hitch.  <h2>2. Orgasm aka the mother of all things wonderful</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-103.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>You are finally there! The climax, or orgasm, is the shortest of the phases and can usually last between 10-25 seconds for both men and women. This phase is generally characterized by a sudden release of the tension that had been building up in the female body during the previous three phases. It is followed by involuntary muscles’ contraction and an extreme sense of pleasure.</p> <p>“Orgasm can be just the reflex contractions in the genitals, which is pleasant, or the more common state (much more pleasurable) where the genital’s reflex contractions correspond to an intense mental state where the person momentarily becomes lost in the moment,” McGough points out. “This brief loss of a sense of self is why the French slang for orgasm is ‘la petite mort’ or ‘the little death.'” Following are all the wonderful, gorgeous things happening to your body during orgasm:</p>  Breathing, blood pressure, muscle tension, blood vessel engorgement and pulse rate are at their absolute peak. There is an increased production of oxytocin which boosts the pleasure from the orgasm and also helps produce contracting spasm in the uterus and cervix. Basically, your body is trying to trap semen by doing this. The contractions also help move the sperm up inside the uterus. These contractions are not noticeable.  <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-6.gif"/>tumblr via giphy  You might notice your hands making a grasping movement or feet curling inwards, though it might not be so for everyone. The muscles throughout your body will convulse and contract hard. Especially the muscles of vagina, pelvis and anus.  <h2>1. Resolution aka where you get to cuddle or have another go</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-104.jpeg"/>via shutterstock     <p>Good job, superstar! You did it. During this stage the body returns to its normal resting state and functioning. Men usually require a ‘refractory period’ during this stage where they are physically unable to go any further. Women however, bounce back quickly and with slight stimulation might go back to orgasm once more (yay evolution and multiple orgasms!). Your body:</p>  All swelling recedes. Your vagina, which becomes bigger in size and puffier, will bounce back to its normal state within a matter of seconds. One moment, it is loose enough to fit a penis and the very next it will be tight enough to hold a tampon inside. As two OBGYNs, Dr. Rebecca Brightman and Dr. Dan Nayot, explain to Elite Daily, your vagina is almost elastic the way it does this. The breasts also return to their normal shape.  <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-7.gif"/>via giphy  Your will have a visible afterglow (thank you, oxytocin). Your heart and breathing rates will go back to their usual business-as-usual selves. Everything will get back to how it was <em>except </em>the cervix. “[The] opening of the cervix remains open. This helps semen travel up into the uterus. After 20 to 30 minutes, the opening closes,” according to Planned Parenthood.    <i></i>
