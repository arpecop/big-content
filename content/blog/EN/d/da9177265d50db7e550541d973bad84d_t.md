Locals, adventurers, mountaineers and thrill seekers have long been wanting to get a glimpse of the mythical yeti hairy like a bear and with teeth that were dog like in appearance.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image.png"/>Wikipedia <p>Scientists looked at a total of nine different samples from the ancient creature. Of all of the different samples one was different and looked like the mixture of a bear and a dog. “It demonstrates that modern science can really try and tackle some of these mysteries and unsolved questions that we have,” Dr. Charlotte Lindquist stated, she is an expert in the field and works as a researcher and academic at the University of Buffalo in New York.</p>     <p>While almost all of the samples that were looked at could clearly be distinguished as being the remains of either dogs or bears there were two that did not fit the description of any known animal. These were from the Indian Himalayas and the mountainous kingdom of Bhutan.</p> <p>Many had braved the harsh weather to traverse mountains in the search of the mythical yeti which in the popular imagination was a snowman like creature and was supposed to look almost human like in appearance. Yeti means that thing there in the Sherpa language of the local people living in the region of Tibet and Nepal the word was translated or rather mistranslated into English as the abominable snowman. Stories of the furry creature deep in the mountains managed to fire up western imagination.</p> <p>The story went that it started off with a holy man or local mystic taking up more or less permanent residence in a cave that was close to Mount Everest and had a clear view of the mighty mountain. It is now believed the Yeti was initially the Himalayan version of the fame boogeyman a mythical creature whose stories were concocted to put children to sleep at night. It was about three and a half centuries later that the myth really began to take off.</p> <p>The Yetis it was said brought the mystic food, water and any other things that might need to carry on with his religious meditation and to continue to lead a life of solitude and prayer. It was not until 1951 however that the west became fascinated with the mythical Yeti when pictures were taken of a strange creature close to Mount Everest. Subsequently many expeditions were organized to try to find the mysterious furry monster of the Himalayan Mountains. None of the expeditions however managed to find any conclusive evidence for the creature’s existence and it continued to remain a part of the popular imagination.</p> <p>This is not the very first time however that there has been scientific evidence proving that the Yeti might have been something other than the snowman of the popular imagination and this latest study only adds to the argument that the Yeti is probably a myth.</p> <p>The breakthrough scientific research shows us that the Yeti might be more bear like than we previously thought. It is suspected that the unrecognizable samples are either a cross between polar bears and brown bears or they could also be some other entirely unknown species about which we did not know about previously.</p>     <p>Many were disappointed that the samples were mostly distinctly those of bears. However it not yet a proved fact that no other creature is out there. Many are still hopeful that a new specie will be found.</p>   <i></i>
