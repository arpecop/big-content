It’s often a game of chance. Sometimes you get the right stuff and sometimes you don’t. Once you click the buy button then all you can really do is hope you get what you ordered. Internet is full of falsely advertised clothes. You might have ordered a cute chiffon dress but what you actually get is whole another horror story. These can be avoided by shopping from trusted websites but now let’s look at 10 biggest online shopping fails straight from people who trusted the wrong website.</p> <h2>10.</h2> <p>This dress was supposed to be a beautiful spaghetti strap cut out dress perfect for morning and evening wear but what came in the mail is a total opposite. This horrendous dress is not the right fitting, not the right material and not even the right color. Doesn’t even look partially similar to the dress advertised.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-594.jpeg"/>imgur/TimeWoundsAllHeels <h2>9.</h2> <p>The advertised dress looks super cute with a pink and white lacy combination. This dress would be everything only if was the one advertised on the picture. The dress that arrived to the not so happy shopper has the weirdest fitting, the cheapest materials and what not</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-595.jpeg"/>shutterstock <h2>8.</h2> <p>Ruffle dresses are nice and make you feel like a total princess. This buyer probably wanted to fell like a princess too but her expectations fall short. The dress that comes in is a proper creature to be assessed. The colour is all wrong for starters. It is miss shaped and the ruffles are all wrong. The last layer is very short. /It does fit right at all. And the list goes on and on</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-596.jpeg"/>DEVILNIGHTUK <h2>7.</h2> <p>Sheer and lacy is not something you’d want to order online. There are a number of things that could go wrong. In this dress everything went wrong. The sheer material clearly looks cheap and the lace on top is no better either. The plain white fabric is supposed to be a nice chic material that the picture shows. What you get instead is a thin, almost see through fabric</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-597.jpeg"/>dainikbhaskar.com <h2>6.</h2> <p>You order a nice crokcet top that you always wanted for your beach look. What comes in the mail doesn’t do much for you but for your cat it’s an entirely different story. The sizing on this top was soo off that the only thing it could fit was the buyer’s cat. I’m sure the cat must have enjoyed it. Not so much of a fail is it now?</p>     <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-598.jpeg"/>shared.com <h2>5.</h2> <p>When you order a nice carpet online for your living room you are expecting it to be a carpet not a napkin. This gentleman clearly look disappointed on the “slightly” misrepresented sizes. What is supposed to a big full size carpet is now smaller than the size of your hands. This just makes us realize the importance of the mentioning the product size online.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-599.jpeg"/>twitter/adamhess1 <p> </p> <h2>4.</h2> <p> </p> <p>When you order furniture online you expect it to at least resemble what you are shown. This is exactly what happened to this couple who bought garden chairs. It does resemble pretty well except for the obvious fact that these could easily be doll house chairs. We have already had the palm sized carpet and now this. All we can say is that size does matter indeed.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-600.jpeg"/>twitter/ellharfordxo <p> </p> <h2>3.</h2> <p>When you order a cute off the shoulder dress, you expect it to be off the shoulder not hanging around your neck and when it looks like a classy material you don’t expect to end up with a shiny monstrosity. This pink dress didn’t exactly live up to the expectations. It’s enough to put anyone off shopping online for clothes ever again.</p>  <p>We LOVE this super cute look in our Dulce dress! https://t.co/kEZvz5l78V #ChiChiClothing #PromDress pic.twitter.com/mUzwk00AYr</p> <p>— Chi Chi London (@chichiclothing) May 9, 2016</p> <p></p> <p> </p> <h2>2.</h2> <p> </p> <p>When you order a jumpsuit online you want a jumpsuit and when it’s supposed to be black you expect black. Not this grey “thing” that hugs all your wrong curves. Bad isn’t even a good enough word for this shopper got. And what happened to the classy fabric that Is shown in the picture?</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-601.jpeg"/>imgur <p> </p> <h2>1.</h2> <p> </p> <p>A skirt is a skirt when you wear it around your waist. It’s not a skirt when you wear it around your thigh. This just looks stupid unless this becomes an actual fashion trend. I personally don’t see frilly thighs becoming a fashion trend anytime soon.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-602.jpeg"/>imgur     <p>Next you want to shop, it might be best to do it in person. These online shopping fails are everything you don’t want to happen to you. Getting a horrible prom dress one day before prom could be a possible nightmare for someone. It’s best to buy stuff after you have tried it on and seen how it fits and if the colour looks nice on you. That way you can avoid your expectations being let down and you facing a sad situation.</p>   <i></i>
