If not the world itself, we can safely say they have an extreme influence over what the world wears. One would assume with so much power and influence comes a lot of transparency, or at least the expectation of it.</p> <p>We all want the industries that come with the kind of power and influence that can change lives, to be a bit more open about the way they operate. Especially when it comes to the industry that thrives on psychological impact of how you appear to the world around you. But naturally, where there is power, there are entirely more secrets and behind closed doors the story is a bit different.</p> <p>Things like why the sizes differ with brand names seem quite skeptical to the keen eye, so without further ado here a few of those secrets about the Fashion industry, that they Don’t want you to know.</p> <h2>10. You’ll Never Keep Up:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-640.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>Like in the famous show “America’s Next Top Model” Tyra Banks says “In the fashion industry one day you’re in and the next day you’re out”, she says this because it couldn’t be any closer to the truth. The trend changes faster than you can possibly keep up. If you think you’ve got this week’s look nailed, think again. It probably got outdated yesterday. Sorry. This is all because of a decision to introduce 52 Micro seasons was initiated by the fashion industry.</p> <p>Before this happened, we only had 2 seasons. Spring/Summer. Fall/Winter. That just isn’t the case these days. Fashion Retailers need new merchandise every week so they keep asking the designers to flood them with new merchandise each week. That pretty much means if you’re a trend follower, you’ll be spending a lot of time walking around with a lighter wallet, because if they keep you wanting more, you’re eventually going to end up spending more!</p> <h2>9. Designer gifting</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-641.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>There’s a little minor detail about the fashion industry that it doesn’t really like talking about. Designer gifting. Although it has been established that working in the fashion industry means you’ll be getting your hands on a lot of free designer things, should that be clothing or various accessories. That’s how magazine editors and writers can afford all the things they talk about in their magazines. And since its pretty much free advertising for designer labels.</p> <p>People however do seem to know about this, but there’s another little spice people don’t know about. Have you ever noticed how your favorite fashion bloggers and writers get to fly around the world? Where does all that money come from? While some may have good salaries, others are flown around by fashion labels. The blogger covers their brand for their publication in return for sponsoring the trip. While this may be considered to be “Paid For content”its not always the case. Although we don’t care much about how the bloggers and writers do things, but it would be nice to be upfront about it don’t you think?</p> <h2>8. Young models:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-642.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>Fashion models seem get younger by the year. You may think this might be discriminatory, but designers have a good reason for this, or so they like to think. Young models not only seem to have the bodies designers desire to dress, but they also work for cheap.</p> <p>Apparently younger girls seem to be okay with living in tight spaces while chasing a starlit dream, some even going as far as to work for free for a little time in the spot light. Sadly, these girls are mostly taken advantage of by the fashion industry. Many older women complain about the fashion industries bias when it comes to designing clothes. The general populous also seems to think that the fashion industry doesn’t even cater to middle aged women either.</p> <p>This is an issue that needs to be addressed and it was time the labels paid some attention where it is needed.</p> <h2>7. Spec Work for Designers</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-643.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>It takes a lot of effort to become a designer, just having a degree doesn’t always mean you’re going to get the job. Sometimes even the elite designers have trouble landing jobs as theres a scam sweeping through the fashion industry like a storm. This scam makes potential hires work free of charge before you hire them, or well, Spec work.</p> <p>In many cases labels expect new hires to design a whole line for them before the job is confirmed. Many designers are quitting pursuing this path in speculation of this mess that is being created by the fashion industry, and we don’t know how long its going to go on this way.</p>     <h2>6. Chemicals in clothing :</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-644.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>Do you remember reading the lable of the last shirt you bought? Don’t for a second believe that the materials written over the tag were the only ones used in that shirt. Did you know manufacturers use chemicals in every step of making your clothing? Some chemiccals are used to make items insect resistant or used to help the garments have a longer shelf life. Other chemicals are used to give clothes their distinct look. Even more shocking is the fact that many of these manufacturers use restricted substances. When American Apparel was in business they used 250 “controlled substances in their garments”.</p> <p>We call these materials restricted because governments all over the world legally regulate them. These chemicals can cause various diseases to the people applying them. They might not be harming you as the end result removes all harmful chemicals, but that doesn’t mean the process isn’t hurting someone else. Think about it.</p> <h2>5. Faulty Design :</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-645.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>Have you ever worn something that wore itself out after you washed it twice? Or maybe it shrunk, who knows, but you know its happened to you. That’s because its meant to happen. IT was designed that way. Back in the day labels were forced to make quality products as one would have expected to wear their bought clothes over the entire season.</p> <p>Sadly this is no longer the case, considering our fashion tastes rotate every week. Designers simply do not have the time to make quality products, leading to unfinished designs that fall apart after a few wears. But there is good news amidst all this chaos. Clothes are much cheaper to wear now than they were.</p> <h2>4. Beading = Child Labor</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-646.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>Watch out people, if you have beads or sequins on your clothing, it may be an indicator of child labor. Many times clothing manufacturers target young children as they have small hands that come handy when it comes to beadwork. More disturbing is the fact these kids are expected to work 16 hours a day in horrible working conditions. Kids as young as 8 or 9 are working to get those beads you flash around under the sunlight. Many manufacturers have reverted from this practice, but it isn’t the case world wide.</p> <h2>3. Pointy Toe Shoes</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-647.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>These are considered a fashion staple, found everywhere in every fashion enthusiast’s closet, and they don’t seem to be going anywhere. Sadly that doesn’t mean they’re good for your feet. Im sure you’re all accustom to the pain that comes along with them, but even more astonishing is the fact that they can cause metatarsalgia, a highly painful condition that causes the balls of your feet to become inflamed. That isn’t all, you can be effected with Neuroma, which is pain between the 3rd and 4th toe.</p> <p>You can stop it from hurting by switching to flats, but sometimes it goes as far as needing surgery. Ouch!</p> <h2>2. Vanity Sizing :</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-648.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>Have you ever worn a size with one brand, but a completely different size with another? Yeah this is a thing. Its called Vanity Sizing. Because the size of American shoppers has increased over the years, so has the the clothing sizing chart. Back in 1958, a size 12 was the same as someone wearing a size 6 today. This is confusing as the size 6 can fluctuate from brand to brand with the matter of inches.</p> <p>Trying jeans is even worse, you can go to a shop, ask for the same size jeans in different brands, and they will all fit differently.</p> <h2>1. The real Cost :</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-649.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>There’s a reason why most of us can get cheap clothing, and it’s all on the expense of other nations workers. It’s great that these brands are creating jobs overseas but the problem is most of the workers are underpaid. The fashion industry now accounts for 80% of Bangladesh’s foreign trade. Researchers believe this trade boom might lift the country out of poverty but for every item that’s $20 only about a dollar goes to the person who made it.</p>     <p>Another issue is the cost of living in Bangladesh compared to the amount these people make. In general these workers only make $630 a month while their living expenses are around $1400 a month. To cater to this issue many manufacturers have moved their production back in the US so if you see a shirt labled Made in US and it didn’t come cheap, just know that it covers all the costs that went into production of this outfit as it came from a place where the workers were getting a healthy stable income, thus increasing the cost of production, thus increasing the price.</p>   <i></i>
