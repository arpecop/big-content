Nice guys aren’t necessarily good men and you are better staying as far away from them as possible. They won’t just use you and manipulate you while you are with them; they will do it with such an effortless charm that you won’t even be able to tell that you are being manipulated. Nice guys are fun to hang with and may be casually date but they are definitely not ‘the one’ material. How do you tell a nice guy apart from a genuinely good man? Here’s how:</p> <h2>10. Expectations</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-725.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>A nice guy will take you out on this romantic date which may seem like something right out of a movie. You’ll love every bit of it and he will make you feel like the princess that you should have been born as. The problem is that he will expect the same from you in return. A good man, however, has a good and genuine nature. He expects nothing in return and instead showers his affections on you because he wants to. He has no ulterior motives and neither an ego to feed. His goodness comes from within.</p> <h2>9. PDA</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-726.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>A nice guy will be huge about public displays of affections. It may make you swoon and a bit glad on the inside for all those envious looks you receive from other women.</p> <p>What you don’t know is that your nice guy is equally pleased on the inside as well about those envious looks from other women. It satisfies his male ego as he flaunts what a perfect boyfriend he is. A good man, on the other hand, may or may not be into PDA. Whatever he does it’s out of love.</p> <h2>8. Kindness</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-6.gif"/>reactiongifs/giphy <p>A nice guy is kind because it pays him to be kind. He likes acting like a kind, caring significant other and laps up the praises he receives from others and your friends on being such a ‘nice guy’. He does it to make himself more appealing but a good man has no such notions in his head. He is kind because that’s who he is by nature.</p> <h2>7. Public image</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-727.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>A nice guy cares too much about what others think about him and would put on acts just to be appreciated by others. His public image as a boyfriend and as a lover is of great importance for him. A good man has no need whatsoever of public approval. As long as he is doing justice to his true self and character, he is at peace.</p>     <h2>6. Ever-changing personality</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-728.jpeg"/>via shutterstock <p>A nice guy has an ever-changing and fluid personality. He adapts the likes and dislikes of the people he’s with and the woman he is dating to make himself more appealing. A good man will stay true to his character and original personality. He does not put on a face when he meets someone new.</p> <h2>5. Rejection</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-7.gif"/>wifflegif/giphy <p>A nice guy lives in fear of rejection and takes it very negatively. Being rejected by a love interest may make him feel that has wasted his energy on someone ‘undeserving’ and sees absolutely no fault of his own. A good man will not take rejection personally and instead of harboring negative feelings about an ex, he will try to improve himself. He handles rejection with grace and although it would hurt him but he wouldn’t give into anger.</p> <h2>4. Reputation</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-8.gif"/>via tumblr <p>A nice guy cares too much about his reputation and popularity. A good man cares more about what people think of his character. Reputation is of secondary importance to him compared to his morals and upright scruples.</p> <h2>3. Forgiveness</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-9.gif"/>via tumblr <p>A nice guy will never apologize or forgive. A good man won’t be insecure and will be able to do both.</p> <h2>2. A trophy</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-10.gif"/>via tumblr <p>A nice guy will only remain in touch with people who can add face value to his life. He likes collecting friends like trophies which he then show off to others. A good man treats everyone with respect and love regardless.</p> <h2>1. Control</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-11.gif"/>via tumblr     <p>A nice guy has no control over him and drifts one relationship to the next, drawn by what people think about him. A good man has stability in life and emotions. He will be in control of his life and its decisions and will not let anyone else influence him.</p>   <i></i>
