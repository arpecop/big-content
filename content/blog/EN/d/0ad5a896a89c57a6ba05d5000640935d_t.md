We often come across individuals who seem from their nature to be much less mature than we would expect of someone of their age group e.g. people who may act like middle schoolers despite crossing into their 40s. Through regressing to an earlier time, one can feel a whole range of negative emotions, one can feel rejected, lost and hopeless. If you think that you may be one of these people, there is no need to worry as this is just a normal human tendency.</p> <p>You do not need to worry! The emotional pain that was experienced in childhood has remained in the body, as if frozen in time. In order to combat this emotional pain within us, we must confront this pain and release it. By reliving these memories, we may able to gain the emotional development that we halted as a coping mechanism.</p> <p>It is important to understand that whilst we do have some universal human qualities, everyone is different and subject to varying circumstances. Every age group has a set of needs and if these needs are not met, the person’s emotional development may halt. In our earlier years, we are especially vulnerable, and emotional pain is more likely to have a greater impact on your psyche.</p> <p>In order to help those stuck at the mental age where they felt the least love, we must understand how emotional trauma in childhood may impact an adult.</p> <h2>Age 0 to 1 years – Early Childhood</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-453.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>In the first year of life, we are incredibly dependant on our mothers. A child needs love and attention from their mother and requires their mother to help fulfil their needs. Where the mother fails to fulfil these needs, the child may become fearful of their well being and may become distrusting of the first person they put their faith in.</p> <p>As an adult, this experience early on in life may have a negative impactive on future relationships and the ability to form social connections. The adult may exhibit trust issues and be unable to put their faith in another.</p> <h2>Age 2 to 4 years – Developing Childhood</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-454.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>In the next phase of life, the child begins to develop self control and understand the workings of the world. The child’s motor skills are developing and they are beginning to learn how to walk and how to speak. If the child is not given attention and love at this age, or is expected to do things outside of the scope of their abilities, they may feel like a loser that is unable to fulfil the expectations of those around them. On the contrary, if the parents are overprotective, this may hinder the child’s ability to learn the hard lessons in life. Additionally, the child will constantly look for social approval which may lead to issues relating to a need for attention.</p> <h2>Age 4 to 6 Years – Prime Childhood</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-455.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Within the next few years, the child continues to develop physically and mentally. The child is extremely curious about the world during this period and will have seemingly infinite questions. There is a ‘why’ with everything he sees or does. During this period, the child needs to be given answers to his/her questions and needs to be supported with regards to his interests, projects and other initiatives. If the parents do not support the creative mind growing inside of the young child, a feeling of guilt may develop. This may result in a lack of focus for any amount of creative work when the child grows up. The adult may lack the motivation to set goals and to work diligently towards them. The guilt could cause the child to develop a passive or frigid nature or may result in psychopathic tendencies.</p>     <h2>Age 7 to 17 – School Going Days</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-456.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>When the child begins going to school, he/she embarks on a new journey. In this new environment, the child will begin learning new things, will be taught new values, and will make new friends. If the child’s parents doubt his/her ability to compete with his/her peers and fail to encourage the young one, the child may begin feeling inferior to others. This complex will impede the child’s ability to work efficiently and will hamper his/her self confidence.</p> <h2>Getting Out of A Similar Situation</h2> <p>If you feel you are in a situation where your emotional growth has been stunted due to experiences from your childhood, then you must attempt to help your inner child by forming a connection with this part of you. You are responsible for your own growth!</p> <h3>Step 1: Imagine Yourself in the Shoes of Your Child Self</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-457.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>You have to be creative and attempt to imagine yourself as a child. Think about your life as a child, the problems you faced at the time and how you dealt with those problems. Attempt to recall memories of your childhood and try and remember how you thought at that time.</p> <h3>Step 2: Converse with the Child Inside</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-458.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Now that you have thought about yourself as a child, try to hold a conversation with this part of you. A technique you can try is taking two different coloured pencils, one in each hand – the pencil in your left hand will represent your childhood self and the other will represent your current self. Now talk to your inner child and try and understand what plagues him/her. The method may not give light to all your questions but will allow you to recollect a forgotten way of life. As you use the method more and more frequently, you will begin to unravel more mysteries and form a bond. By giving attention to this part of you, long forgotten scars may begin to heal.</p>     <p>When conversing with your inner child, it is important to remain patient. It may take weeks or even months for your inner self to open up. The child inside has been suffering for a long time and will not so easily allow you into that vulnerable part of him. When conversing, you must remember that you are talking to a child and as such you need to understand that the other person is extremely sensitive. You must be extremely empathetic to the feelings and needs of the child. Slowly, by showing this part of yourself love, you will notice that the child is beginning to mature emotionally. The child will begin to become less insecure and will begin to open up. In your everyday life, you will feel yourself exhibiting a more positive attitude and will feel the high associated with personal growth.</p>   <i></i>
