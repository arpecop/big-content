Many like to go shopping, some workout, others drink, some smoke, while many of those who are too young, sleep. But how much is enough and where does one really draw the line? How are these supposed addictions kicked to the curb, well let’s find out?</p> <p>Let’s start with the basics of by defining what ‘Addictions’ are.</p> <p>Addictions are anything that makes someone become dependent, crave, become habitual or fixated on something. Some have addictions of shopping, some at the ends of their hair, some bite their nails and peel the skin around their nails… we’re all a little weird and have weird addictions.</p> <p>While a ‘habit’ is something that is completely different, it is usually done by choice and can be stopped, that too successfully when the individual desires.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-167.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>The thing about addictions is that it most definitely leads to problems that can be visible by the people that you interact with on a day-to-day basis.</p> <p>But here’s the thing, some addictions might be damaging to your bank account or your nail beds, others, such as substances; alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, cannabis, etc., all have a far more serious and injurious impact when it comes to your body and bank account.</p> <p>The following are the most abused substances:</p> <p>a. Alcohol</p> <p>b. Amphetamines</p> <p>c. Cannabis (Marijuana)</p> <p>d. Cocaine</p> <p>e. Hallucinogens</p> <p>f. Hallucinogens</p> <p>g. Tobacco</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-168.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>The thing I that, these are just the most harmful ones, there are far more dangerous that affect your health, wellbeing, and safety, each having a specialized treatment that psychologists, psychiatrists, and doctors work to help their patients overcome the dangerous addictions… Treatment plans range from one on one to group.</p> <p>The cause of addiction is not fully understood by those who are’ sober’, as there is a combination of emotional, mental, circumstantial and physical factors which impact. As an individual’s dependency converts to tolerance it becomes far more difficult to reverse the effects of the substance and abuse, and that is one of the reasons for relapse.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-169.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>It is very startling that there is a large number of individuals who realize that they have a serious problem with a substance. They have become so accustomed to that routine of, popping a pill or taking a shot that they are no ignorant to the fact that they do it, incorporating in their nature, or so one could say.</p> <p>Now it is highly important to know that now all addictions are the same or should be treated the same way as other treatments. The treatment plan ranges as does the contents of the treatment, no two are the same. For some, it might be the duration of a few weeks while others have gone through months, years and even decades of therapy and treatment, and should they relapse, it is a whole other plan of action of these individuals.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-170.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>Many treatment plans also help in assisting families that have been affected by substance addiction, as many are impacted emotionally, mentally and physically due to their loved one’s addiction.</p> <p>Now in our observation, we found that Alcohol addiction is the most common addiction out there.
