And just be present in the now? Luckily, there are ways for you to achieve that feeling.</p> <p>What you need to be practicing effectively is “mindfulness”. A psychological process of bringing all your attention to events and experiences occurring in one particular moment. The moment you’re living right now. Mindfulness is developed through the practice of meditation and other forms of mental training.</p> <p>Mindfulness is also a significant practice of Buddhist traditions and the term is a translation of the Pali term <em>“sati”</em>. It is used to develop self-knowledge and wisdom that ultimately leads to the illumination of the mind or freedom from suffering. Been around for thousands of years, it is practiced mainly in the Eastern parts of the globe but the West seems to be catching on as experts and athletes all over the world are looking at it as the next big thing in psychology!</p> <p>The main idea behind mindfulness is to pay attention to what is happening around you with an open mind and a compassionate attitude for anything that you are experiencing.</p> <p>These techniques might even help you battle some of the stress factors in your life. Yes, they might seem difficult at first, but if you keep at it, it will get better and you’ll soon see the benefits that it brings to your life.</p> <p>Here’s the simplest things you can start practicing in order to lead a more ‘mindful’ life.</p> <h2>7. Practice Gratitude</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-728.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>“The Blessed One said, ‘Now what is the level of a person of no integrity? A person of no integrity is ungrateful and unthankful. This ingratitude, this lack of thankfulness, is advocated by rude people. It is entirely on the level of people of no integrity. A person of integrity is grateful and thankful. This gratitude, this thankfulness, is advocated by civil people. It is entirely on the level of people of integrity.” – Katannu Sutta by Thanissaro Bhikkhu (American born Buddhist monk). </p> <p>We are always reminded, usually by our elders to be grateful for what we have. And mindfulness teaches us exactly that. It teaches us that we should be thankful for everything and everyone we have in our lives at that very moment without the feeling of wanting more or feeling like what you have isn’t enough. It also teaches us to never, ever, envy others.</p> <p>An easy way to practice gratitude is to write down three things you’re grateful for, every day as soon as you wake up. You need to be as specific as you can be, specificity is key to fostering gratitude which is necessary for integrity. What does that mean exactly? Well, for one it teaches patience, which is a very important element in Buddhism.</p> <p>This exercise only takes about 15 minutes and it’s super easy! All you have to do is remember a time that you were truly happy in life, a person that makes you happy, and an experience in your life, and just feel the flow of emotions go right through you.</p> <h2>6. Feel your feet and palms</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-730.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>This technique will help you be present in the moment, much like an anchor it will pull you deeper in the environment and help you connect with everything on a spiritual level. All you need to do is focus on the pads of your palms and feet. Draw attention to the pressure on the floor underneath your feet. Does it feel warm or cool, do you feel comfortable or uncomfortable? Become one with all those emotions and let them engulf you.</p> <p>Once you do become aware of your palms and feet, then you’re ready for the next step. Clench your hand into a fist and then release. Clench, release, and repeat. This will help your mind to focus on your body at that moment, but you can expect your mind to wander off into other deep thoughts and that’s completely normal. Just remember to bring your mind back and focus on your exercise.</p> <h2>5. Notice the environment</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-732.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>You don’t have to manipulate any of your emotions to practice mindfulness, that’s not what it is about. Manipulation plays no role in mindfulness and is highly discouraged. All you have to do is take in your surroundings and really see what’s around you. Allow your mind to wander, explore and just let go.</p> <p>Even as you’re cruising through this article, slow down and really read each word, or take a look at the number of items on your coffee table. If, there’s a bottle of water on the table, take a sip, if you see a pen, write down a positive message to yourself.</p> <p>Learn to expand your awareness beyond what you see in front of you. Focus on the sounds that you hear around you and notice the colors of the environment, feel the temperature of the room on your skin. Really take the time to be fully aware and present in the atmosphere you’re in.</p>     <h2>4. Breathe deeply</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-734.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Meditating is a popular technique which mainly focuses on deep breathing and we see why meditating comes with a number of benefits which we will discuss in a bit. Start by finding a nice, quiet place where you can relax, without any distractions. Sit in a comfortable position and breathe in for three seconds then exhale for three seconds. You’re going to want to chant a mantra to make the whole process more enjoyable and help you focus better. So, deep breaths, inhale, 3 seconds, exhale, 3 seconds. The more you practice, the more you’ll be able to increase the number of seconds of breathing.</p> <p>Now, let’s get to the benefits. We all know that meditating is used to release stress and to relax but there are also 5 science-backed reasons to meditate.</p>  It will help you understand pain. Pain is a part of life but that doesn’t mean you have to let it engulf you. Mindfulness helps you heal your relationship with your soul and restore the damage it has caused both mentally and physically. Mindfulness helps you connect better with your loved ones. Do you ever catch yourself staring into space and not catching one thing the person said? By practicing mindfulness, you will be fully present in the moment and won’t miss a thing. Stress is a major factor in a lot of illnesses and can make occurring illnesses even worse. Meditation will help you to lower and release that stress. Meditating helps you to stay focused and trains your brain to not be distracted by every little thing. Those little whispers in your head, shouldn’t be so loud. It’s time to get some rest!  <h2>3. Listen, don’t just hear</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-736.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>One of the biggest issues we have in, today’s society, is that we hear, we don’t actually listen to what the other person is saying, or what the environment is telling us. Ever heard of “read between the lines”? Listen to what people aren’t telling you by looking at their body language. Also, pay attention to the matter of how long it takes you to judge someone while having a conversation with them. So, you can ultimately stop yourself from passing judgment. You should never judge someone even if they come off as a little stand-offish. You never know what someone is going through so don’t let that interaction be the last impression you have of them.</p> <h2>2. Watch what you eat</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-738.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Practicing mindfulness means being mindful of what you eat and enjoying the full experience of what you are eating. That means paying attention to taste, texture, smell, and even temperature of your food. You’ll find that the healthier you eat, the better you will feel. The saying “you are what you eat” is definitely true. It’s better to avoid using your phone while eating, it will help you to connect with those who are in your company as well. It’s all about connecting and having a better understanding with each and everything around you. Here are six ways you can practice mindful eating.</p>  Enjoy your meal by eating slowly and really savoring the flavors of your meal. Eating fast and rapidly will ignore your body’s signals. Really listen to your body and understand what it’s trying to say. Focus on what foods agree with your digestive system and which don’t. Listen to your body’s personal hunger signals. Are you actually hungry or just filling the void with food? It’s better to eat with your loved ones at a set time rather than eating alone, at random times during the day. Practice eating food that rich in nutrients and healthy rather than eating food that just gives you comfort. So, put down those burgers and fries and opt for some delicious grilled chicken and brown rice instead. Be aware of where your food comes and how it’s prepared. Be attentive to your plate when you’re eating. Being distracted by your phone or the tv is a recipe for not listening to your bodily needs.  <h2>1. The mindful shower</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-740.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>The shower is a great place to open up your mind and let go of the stress of the day. The next time you decide to hop in the shower, embrace the touch of the water against your skin. Feel the heat from the hot water flowing down your body, and take in the aroma of the body wash. The shower is the one place we all go to gather our thoughts and work out our issues. However, instead of overthinking, just relax. If you’re not a fan of showers, a bath can work just as well. Light a few candles and drop in your favorite bath-bomb, and you’re set for a relaxing bath!</p> <p>Keeping all these things in mind it is important to understand that mindfulness exists in each one of us and just has to be practiced every day to get the full experience. Take it from the big guy himself, the Dalai Lama,</p>     <p>“Blessings don’t come from outside, but from within. Whatever blessings we receive are the result of our own efforts and positive actions”.</p>   <i></i>
