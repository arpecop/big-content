Winter is incomplete without warm clothes, soups, snow, and most importantly flu, which is generally the most hated thing about winters. It wouldn’t be wrong if I say that flu is simply winter’s partner in crime. Sniffing and sneezing at work or during a class is quite irritating, and this might compel you into thinking of ways to get rid of this irritation.</p> <p>Well, to cure flu, doctors suggest washing your hands (in order to get rid of the virus) and avoid staying in places where people are closely packed (which helps protecting you against the viral agents). But whether you take such precautions or not, you are still likely to experience a full flow of mucus through your nose. The good thing for you is that we have brought some amazing ideas for you to tackle flu efficiently and without feeling crap and of course, without excessive use of typical nasal sprays.</p> <h2>7. Pressurize and release</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1377.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>This process revolves around cleaning the flu by applying pressure on palette. This process revolves around 2 basic steps which include using your tongue and pressuring your palette. And use your finger against pressure points. Press your tongue against the roof of your mouth and release after a few seconds. After that, put you index finger and middle finger in the middle of your eyebrows on your forehead, press for a few seconds and then release. So basically it goes like, press you tongue press your finger, press your tongue press your fingers and continue this process for around 20 to 30 seconds and feel the difference.</p> <h2>6. Take control of your breath</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1378.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>It is obvious to feel suffocated when you are suffering from flu as your head throbs and you feel that you are not getting enough air because of your blocked nose. But there’s something that can help you in eliminating this feeling, which is simply holding your breath. It’s better to lie down while opting for this particular tip as you are required to tip your head back. After lying down hold or pinch your nose using your thumb and index finger and hold your breath as long as you can, which is hardly for a few seconds and leave as soon as you feel uncomfortable. In other words inhale and exhale consciously like how it’s done in yoga or meditation.</p> <h2>5. Switch on a humidifier</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1379.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>Dry indoor air makes our flu more miserable. Also, researchers suggest that dry and polluted air is extensively prone to viruses and helps them to survive for a long time. However, humidifier or a steam vaporizer makes this dry air bearable by adding suited amount of moisture to it.</p> <p>This means, humidifier is a must in winters especially if you are living in areas where the air is dry or the ratio of pollution is relatively high. Also, steam vaporizer helps in eradicating sinuses and nasal congestions directly if used under doctors’ supervision. These humidifiers may also help in reducing the survival or viruses.</p> <p>Don’t forget to clean them every few days to prevent the growth of bacteria and molds.</p>     <h2>4. Seek help from steam</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1380.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>Sinus and nasal congestion are the initial and the most common symptoms of flu. As soon as you experience any on these symptoms, use steam to get some relief. The heat or the warmth of the steam loosens mucus while letting the moisture help in relieving dry nasal passages. Boil some water in a pot, drape a towel over your head and lean over the hot water. Close your eyes and breathe deeply through your nose for at least 30 seconds.</p> <p>Moreover, you can also add up a few drops of sinus or congestion clearing essential oils such as eucalyptus or peppermint, to clear sinus significantly. Trying hot water bath may also perk you up and help in reducing congestion to some extent. Flush out your nose as often as possible</p> <h2>3. Flush out your nose as often as possible</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1381.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>Throughout the winter season add this in your nighttime routine to rinse your nose with either a nasal irrigator or saline solution. This helps in clearing out viral particles that you might have inhaled during daytime, before they take root in your system. Blowing your nose is the best way to get the excess mucus out of your sinuses and nasal passages. DO NOT inhale mucus back into your nose else this excess mucus becomes alarming after some time as it results in sinus pressure and earaches. Also, remember to blow your nose in the right way i.e. one side at a time by gently applying pressure on the other side.</p> <h2>2. Neti pot – Can be a live saver</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1382.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>Buy a Neti pot from food stores and pharmacies or else any kind of bottle or container having a thin spout can also work. Or you can simply opt for a saline squeezed bottle. This pot works in alliance with a saline solution (typically salt and sterile water), which clears the nasal passages by thinning and flushing down sinuses.</p> <p>Tilt you head on one side over a sink, insert the spout into one nostril and pour down the solution slowly. The solution will flow in one nostril and will come out of the other nostril. Once the water stops dripping, blow your nose gently and repeat the process by tilting your head on the other side too.</p> <h2>1. Drink plenty of fluids</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1383.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>The minute you experience the very first sign of a cold or flu, start drinking A LOT of water right away. Blowing your nose and excessive sweating due to fever and other reasons dehydrates your body to a large extent. And this can worsen and increase flu symptoms such as headaches and a dry, irritated throat.</p>     <p>Drink plenty of water, juices and beverages and have enough soups. But make sure, you avoid sugary sodas caffeinated drinks as they are diuretic, which cause you to urinating more and loose water. But, make sure you balance you intake of fluids. Try small sips because a gulp might cause you to throw up. However, keep an eye on your urine. Pale yellow or almost clear urine depicts that you are well hydrated, whereas, dark yellow color tells that you are dehydrated.</p>   <i></i>
