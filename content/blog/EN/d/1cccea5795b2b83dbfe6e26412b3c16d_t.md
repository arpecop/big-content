We’ve heard stories about those who tested the waters and are now at the top of their field. Going out of familiar territory may seem difficult and even impossible, but there are many good reasons for doing this.</p> <p>Of course, there are ways in which a tidy little niche could provide you all that you need. However, it is always good to keep yourself on your toes a little bit. Still not convinced? We’ll present you with a whole load of reasons on why getting out of your comfort zone is best.</p> <h2>Define the Zone, then Break It</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1536.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>In order to set yourself free of your comfort zone, you need to define it first. It is basically what makes you calm and content. While this is obviously a comforting place to be, it could be dangerous for your personal and professional development.</p> <p>For instance, your daily routine could be one thing that you’re comfortable in. It may make you happy to fall asleep watching television when you come home. However, this isn’t really the healthiest way to spend your free time. It may scare you to actually go out and attend a social gathering, but immensely beneficial for your future.</p> <h2>The Healthy Side of Stress</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1537.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>When you move outside your comfort zone, it automatically grates on your nerves a bit. This causes stress, which is normally not a good thing. However, this kind of stress is actually healthy, as it keeps you alert and adaptable.</p> <p>Think of it this way; when a butterfly pushes its way out of the cocoon, it has to go through a tough time. Still, if you cut the cocoon open, you are actually not helping it. The pressure required to squeeze out actually causes the butterfly’s wings to get the fluid they need. Without this, the wings would be wrinkled and the butterfly would eventually die.</p> <p>Just like that butterfly, we need to go through a bit of difficulty in pushing out of our cocoon. This is essential if we are to grow, get motivated, and perform our best.</p> <h2>Life is in YOUR Control</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1538.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>When you’re stuck in a rut, you’re actually letting your surroundings control you. That couch and the remote are not your tools, but you are in their power. If you are afraid of the outside world, this uncertainty would never let you rest.</p> <p>On the other hand, exploring risks and getting experience would make you more in control of yourself and your world. If something goes wrong, you would be more in a position to deal with it. The more you gain knowledge of what was previously unfamiliar, the stringer you would get in body and soul.</p> <p>Stop. While comfort has a familiar flavor, exploring the unknown tastes divine. When we look at things differently, dealing with sudden and unexpected changes becomes easier.</p> <h2>Enlightenment Follows Experience</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1539.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Keeping in line with experiencing new things, you are in a better position to analyze what life throws at you. When you get out of your comfort zone, you immediately start gaining new understanding. The world is a vast place, and there are many things to learn. You may even learn a new skill, experience new feelings, and have an energy like never before.</p> <p>Living this new life would make an enlightened person out of you. Where you were once inspired by your heroes, you could become a source of inspiration yourself. Moreover, you learn to challenge your own concepts and thinking. Thus, you are constantly growing and developing as a thinker, a creator, and a human being.</p> <h2>You’ll Get More Done</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1540.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>When you’re safely ensconced in your comfort zone, you may be achieving your goals. However, these goals would get easier and easier every day, and you won’t be accomplishing anything out of the ordinary. For example, it’s great that you are able to cook simple meals for yourself. However, you could easily get bored of it. Trying something new every now and then would actually make you more productive and well-rounded.</p> <p>When you do try out something unfamiliar, don’t be afraid of things like tight deadlines or the occasional slip-up. This is actually what would drive you towards excellence. A little push could be all you need!</p> <h2>A Fearless Lion</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1541.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Stepping outside the comfort zone might mean some scary experiences this could mean switching jobs, taking a transfer, or traveling. However, when you once take the plunge, new experiences don’t seem that scary anymore. A child is always afraid to div for the first time. That dive is essential to his learning to swim, which would then make him unafraid of diving from even a great height.</p> <p>So in case you’re wondering; it gets easier. People may get shocked at how you’re ready to take on huge challenges. They wouldn’t know that you’ve already got a strong base of pushing the limits and coming out safe.</p> <h2>Clear Thoughts, Smart Choices</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1542.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Let’s face it; a comfortable person cannot be a very good decision-maker. They usually run on autopilot, and as such don’t expect to run into a snag, when they do, they’re at a loss about which way to turn.</p> <p>On the other hand, if you’ve already left your comfort zone behind, you won’t be afraid of making a choice you have the expertise and knowledge to know that you’re making an informed decision. Plus, if anything goes wrong, you know how to handle it.</p> <p>This doesn’t mean that you make hasty decisions, though. Letting go of your comfort zone could also mean actually taking out some time to think about your decisions. This way you could think more clearly and decide upon which way to go.</p> <h2>Blooming and Blossoming</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1543.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>The fear of failure is a major culprit in holding one back. You may not socialize at a party for fear of being rejected. Similarly, you may not ask for a well-deserved promotion fearing that you may get fired. However, if you are pushing your limits, you would not hold back and compromise if you can help it.</p> <p>Leaving your comforts behind mean striding on and gaining new summits. In this manner, we also realize our potential and learn even more than we expected. At the very least, we’re certainly not going to let anyone take advantage of us.</p> <h2>Strut Like a Peacock</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1544.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Needless to say, your experience in handling new things gives you a confidence like never before. There may be some worries and nervousness to start with. Eventually, however, you would feel absolutely thrilled at the idea of a challenge. It’s like playing a sport; when you’re good at it, you learn to take risks and even break your own records.</p>     <h2>Unleashing the Artist Within</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1545.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>The creative mind can become limited due to all sorts of fears. We fear opening our hearts to other people; their reactions could make or break us. So moving out of the comfort zone is very important if you want your creativity to blossom.</p> <p>The chance to showcase some creativity might not work out well the first or second time. However, you have to keep at it in order to remain true to yourself. This would eventually open up your curiosity and creativity even further, making success an achievable goal.</p> <h2>No More Wistfulness</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1546.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Even when we’re comfortable enough, we still sigh about achieving our dreams. Well, it’s time to do away with wishing and start getting active! When you get out there, you get a novel kind of happiness from the change. This physically motivates your brain to perform at its level best.</p> <h2>You’re at Your Peak</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1547.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Moving away from the familiar would propel you towards new heights. Hence, you would be at the top of your game, at least for the time being. Here’s hoping that you get such a taste for adventure that even excellence wouldn’t be enough for you!</p> <p>When you do away with the familiar, you have to mature in order to adapt. This makes you a much better person in both your career and your personal life.</p> <p>In fact, psychological experts have found proof that a bit of anxiety is actually what helps us achieve our best. You have to be at least a little anxious before you study hard for an exam, right?</p> <h2>Broaden that Perspective</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1548.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Going out into an uncomfortable light may not be very tempting. However, when we get used to it, we notice and experience new horizons. This way, we might even change our stance on some concepts that could be set in stone otherwise.</p> <p>If it wasn’t for people stepping out of their comfort zones, the current world would be very different. We may not even have the women’s right to vote. That was certainly uncomfortable for many people back then!</p> <h2>The Comfort Widens</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1549.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Strange but true; once you forsake your comfort zone, you could actually find more comfort in more places! Simply speaking, the more your experience new stuff, the more you are relaxed about future obstacles.</p> <p>A person who’s traveled a lot would not be afraid of visiting a new country, for instance. He would know how to navigate himself and how to ask for help if need be. This way, he could be at home in France as well as in Germany.</p> <h2>A Festive Elder</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1550.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Afraid of growing old? You can slow down the process by jumping out of your comfort zone! When you limit your life, you become susceptible to premature aging. If there are ever-expanding boundaries though, you could be dubbed a sprightly young thing even when you’re 80!</p> <p>Look at it this way; you’re constantly challenging your brain and keeping it busy. This tends to ward off Alzheimer’s and generally help people stay mentally fit as they age.</p> <h2>Know Yourself More</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1551.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You would never really know yourself if you insist on dwelling in the familiar. It is when you test yourself and eventually pas with flying colors that you’d discover news aspects within. There’s nothing to gain and everything to lose by being lazy and not bothering to tap into your hidden reserves of talent and skill.</p> <h2>More Options Available</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1552.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>There are many people today who feel stuck in their career or life choices. They don’t really have to be. All it takes is a little leap of faith. This would open up new opportunities for them, and they may even develop new interests.</p> <p>When one gets out into the world, they may discover new ways to live life. This could be much more satisfactory and fulfilling than their previous tedium and monotony.</p> <h2>Make Connections to the Outside World</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1553.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Everyone has to interact with the outside world whether they like it or not. You could make it easy for yourself by grooming your confidence and abilities. What better way to do so than to step outside your little cocoon of comfort?</p> <p>When you develop new interests, hobbies, and skills, you would discover people with them too. You may then end up making a bunch of new friends and maybe even some very valuable connections.</p> <h2>Faith in Yourself</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1554.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>There’s no better way to feel comfortable in your own skin than braving the elements outside your comfort zone. Things may get difficult, but you would eventually learn to rely on yourself. And you would realize that you’re not such a bad support after all.</p> <p>When you’re too comfortable, you may not know how to deal with problems when you come across them. Once you are developed enough, though, you would know that few problems have no way out.</p>     <p>In conclusion, try pushing the limits a little when you want to achieve success. It’s all well and good to be comfortable, but stagnation is what leads to failure and ultimate regret.
