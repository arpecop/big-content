Charles Manson and his cult followers committed a series of gruesome murders. Now Twitter user are confusing him with singer Marilyn Manson.</p> <p>The group that Charles founded known as the Manson family killed a total of nine people in a period of just two months in the months of July and August, 1969. The victims were killed in cold blood at four separate locations and the murders shook and terrified people across the United States.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1213.jpeg"/>wikimedia <p>Two years later Manson and his group were convicted for the murder of nine people. In addition to this his group was convicted of conspiracy to kill a total of seven people including the very popular Hollywood actress, Sharon Tate. In addition to these seven murders Charles Manson himself was convicted for the deaths of two more people.</p> <p>Now Marilyn Manson is many things creepy, obnoxious, downright scary, attention hungry but something that he is not a cult leader and he does not kill people!</p>     <p>Over the weekend people got the two Mansons all messed up. While a large number of Twitter users suddenly became fans of the musician Charles Manson a man who does not exist. The RIP or Rest in Peace hashtag is usually reserved for people who have contributed something positive to society this time Twitter users went out pouring their heart felt sadness and outpouring of grief.</p> <p>Now of course there is no way to tell with one hundred percent certainty as to the actions of the users who wishing were wishing Rest in Peace to such a spooky and notorious serial killer. Now of course it is all very insulting and demeaning for the victims of the loved ones that the so called Manson family murdered but in this haze of sheer confusion it seems most twitter users mourning Charles Manson have probably mixed him up. Even though however a number no matter how small must be out there among the confused who are genuinely sad that serial killer has died after rotting in prison for forty six years serving out his life sentence.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1214.jpeg"/>wikimedia <p>Now so one might ask what is the link between the two Mansons Charles the mass murderer and Marilyn Manson the creepy musician who happens to churn out some rather good music? Well the answer to that is Marilyn Manson; chose his stage name by combining the name of two very different people from the iconic sixties, Marilyn Monroe the heart throb who was also the mistress of two of the Kennedy brothers President John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his younger brother Robert Kennedy, and his last name from the Charles Manson the most feared killer of the late sixties and early seventies.</p> <p>Twitter was hilarious over the weekend as people messed up two men in all sorts of strange and shocking ways. We can just hope that Twitter’s shockingly ill-informed users managed to get the two their facts straight about the two men.</p>     <p>So just to clear any confusion that anyone might still have the two men have nothing in common about them minus the fact that they share the same surname they are not the same person and in fact are not related to each other in any other way. Charles Manson the serial killer and cult leader died over the weekend at the age of 83 after spending most of his life behind bars for his gruesome crimes. The singer Marilyn Manson is still alive and kicking and at the age of 48 remains as healthy as ever and his diehard fans need not despair or mourn at his passing,</p>   <i></i>
