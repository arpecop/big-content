However, some of us are definitely smarter than others. Some people are also downright geniuses. Few of us realize, though, that there may be certain signs in our physical bodies and actions about this aspect.</p> <p>With a bit of self-study and introspection, you may very well find out that you’re destined to become a genius. Scientific studies have determined the link between some physical attributes to higher intelligence. There are also certain habits that could be a sign of advanced intelligence among humans. Read on in order to test yourself for super-genius status:</p> <h2>The Orbs Sign</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1851.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Test your intelligence by taking a look at the size of your pupils. A study conducted by the Georgia Institute of Technology found a link between intelligence and pupil size. This study consisted of hundreds of participants.</p> <p>The pupil size you need to be looking at is a resting one. It should not be in the process of dilation due to medication or anything else. Those with larger pupils were found to have a higher memory capacity and generally scored higher on intelligence tests. The pupil sizes were measured when they were carrying out the task that got their brain juices flowing.</p> <h2>The Length of Our Digits</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1853.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>In one other psychological study, it was found that the lengths of our fingers may be an indication of our intelligence. More specifically, the length of our fingers in relation to each other. The study in question looked at almost a hundred children and compared their finger lengths to their performance in certain tests.</p> <p>Admittedly, this particular study may not have been the most comprehensive one. However, it did detect a link between the lengths of the index and ring finger with their test scores. Interestingly, the results were different for male and female children.</p> <p>For boys, the shorter their index finger was, the better they performed at math. Girls, on the other hand, performed the best when their ring and index fingers were around the same length.</p> <h2>The Hairy Sign</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1855.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>You may not think it a good thing to have too much hair. Think again! In certain studies, the bodies of students were examined and a connection between hairiness and intelligence was found. This study was conducted on medical students based in America.</p> <p>In fact, the study even concluded that those who became doctors or had advanced education in any form may be prone to more hair. So it’s either intelligence or a smooth body, with some exceptions, of course.</p> <p>Within the medical students examined, the one who ranked higher in academic was also found to be hairier. Quite a strange connection, but we have to accept that there may be definite link there.</p> <h2>What the Height Determines</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1857.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>This may seem even stranger than the points above, but one’s height may also signal just how much your intellect is. More specifically, we’re talking about the height we are at when we reach the age of sixteen.</p> <p>In fact, one’s height at his age may even be a deciding factor in their social status and their income level when they get older. Studies have shown that the taller a person is, the more likely they were to earn a huge paycheck.</p> <p>Of course, this does not apply to every single successful person on the planet. Obama and Steve Jobs are certainly tall men, but there are quite a few examples of successful short people. Still, this little piece of information may come in handy for making certain investments, if nothing else!</p> <h2>Vampires and Owls</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1858.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>The old saying about being happy healthy and wise if you sleep early may not be so true after all. Of course, it may help along your productivity, but may not be a signal of your inner intelligence.</p> <p>Simply put, you just may be the genius kind of folk if you tend to wander around the house at night. Literally not being able to go to bed early may be an indicator of being a genius at heart. This was the subject of an actual study conducted on some Americans. The sleeping patterns that revolved around staying up late were of those who scored higher on the intelligence measuring tests.</p>     <p>When all is said and done, though, going to bed and getting up early is a highly commendable thing to do. It is better for your health and in the long term factor of your studies too. However, some people have been in the habit of going later to bed than others. This may be true regardless of whether it is a weekday or weekend. These would most likely be the ones who grow up to be the most intelligent adults.</p> <p>If you are a true genius, you may be unable to regulate your schedule with proper working hours. This is not so surprising since many of the geniuses whose inventions shaped the world were known for their eccentric sleeping habits. Thomas Edison, for instance, only took power naps when he felt tired. Other great minds may have suffered from insomnia for most of their lives.</p> <p>At the end of the day, however, saying up late at night is only an attraction option if it is an option. Otherwise, it’s not so glamorous to toss and turn and want to fall asleep but not being able to.</p> <h2>Being Annoying</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1859.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Geniuses are rarely popular folks among their peers. This is because they are usually thinking at a whole other level than the people around them. Perhaps the character of Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory is the best modern illustration of this factor.</p> <p>Those who have a higher level of intelligence would also be asking more questions about anything and everything. They may even question the common everyday aspects of life that others take for granted. For instance, they may ask just why we place the spoons and forks in a certain way when setting the table. Such questions may seem annoying and unnecessary at times.</p> <p>However, it is exactly through these questioning minds that some of the best inventions came to light. Bright minds don’t stop their questioning and are rarely ashamed of it. In all cases, they must not be suppressed.</p> <p>Of course, a genius may be made to feel ashamed of acting differently from everyone else. This is just one of the prices one has to pay for being extra, ultra-smart.</p> <h2>Conversing With Yourself</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1860.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Talking to oneself may be a sign of a mental disease, but it could also be a sign of high intelligence. Siblings and peers may make fun of a genius when he or she exhibits this tendency. However, all the taunting in the world can’t take away from the fact that the self-conversers are probably the smartest person in the room.</p> <p>So if you find yourself discussing something with your own mind, don’t worry too much. As long as you’re not hearing different voices replying back to you in your head, it’s a good sign. You may stumble on something mind-blowing if you continue like this.</p> <h2>Burrowing Into Books</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1861.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>A love of reading may also get one ridiculed, but ultimately mean great things are in store for you. Or, at least, stored up in your mind. Those with high IQs are usually at their happiest when browsing bookstores, in libraries, or just curled up reading in bed. They may also often find themselves with no idea of how the time went by while they were immersed in a book.</p> <p>Of course, the obsession with reading may make one anti-social. The good news, however, is that book lovers are found all over the world. Online and offline groups of those with similar tastes could change your life and introduce you to exciting new titles.</p> <h2>Personal Challenges</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1862.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Challenging yourself may be a huge part of your life. This could consist of beating your own reading or typing speed or learning new ways to solve problems. These challenges may or may not have any practical use, but they do serve to sharpen your brain.</p> <p>Hence, geniuses would love it when they are gifted with a challenging puzzle. They like to bend their minds to the most difficult task possible. The rush they get when they find the solution is probably akin to that of a rollercoaster dive. When it comes to books, they would prefer those with twists, mysteries, or puzzles. They would then try to figure out the answer before it is revealed.</p> <h2>Being Absent-Minded</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1863.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>The above habits kind of make it clear just how muddle a genius’ brain can get at times. So if you find yourself forgetting the simplest of tasks or misplacing the same thing every day, go take an IQ test. You may be pleasantly surprised by the result!</p>     <p>Of course, there are exceptions to every rule. This is all the more true when it comes to talking about something as subjective as human intelligence. It’s not just grades that determine whether one’s a genius or not. However, having some of the features and habits described above would certainly win us some serious bragging rights!</p>   <i></i>
