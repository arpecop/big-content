         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 0<p> </p> <p>Actor Kevin Spacey has been accused of sexual misconduct by actor Anthony Rapp when he was 14 years old.</p> <p>The actor took to twitter to respond to these allegations with regret as he felt that although he doesn’t remember such an incident taking place, however, if it did happen then there is certainly no excuse for it.</p> <p>Spacey tweeted that he was “beyond horrified to hear [Rapp’s] story. I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago. But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years.”</p>  <p>pic.twitter.com/X6ybi5atr5</p> <p>— Kevin Spacey (@KevinSpacey) October 30, 2017</p> <p></p> <p>Earlier, Rapp, who is a regular on the TV show Star Trek: Discovery, while giving an interview to Buzzfeed alleged that Spacey, who currently stars in Emmy-nominated political drama House of Cards, tried to seduce him after a party in 1986.</p> <p>“He picked me up like a groom picks up the bride over the threshold. But I don’t, like, squirm away initially, because I’m like, ‘What’s going on?’ And then he lays down on top of me,” said Rapp.</p> <p>The 46 year old actor continued, “I don’t know if I would have used that language. But I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually.”</p> <p>According to Rapp, he met spacey in 1986 when both actors were performing on Broadway shows. Spacey, who was 26 at the time, invited Rapp to a party at his Manhattan apartment. However, after reaching the party Rapp felt bored as there were only adults over there and went into the bedroom to watch television. He only found out the party had ended when Spacey entered the room. According to him, Spacey was clearly drunk and that is when he tried to get sexual with the 14 year old young actor.</p>     <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-administrator-downloads-31-10-2566-01-jpg.jpeg"/>Wiki <h2>Why is Rapp speaking out now?</h2> <p>In his interview the actor said that he had hoped to never see Spacey again after that encounter which happened almost three decades ago. However, it is only now that he gathered the courage to speak out.</p> <p>The actor, who started his career as a child star when he was 9 years old said that he spoke about his story now after getting encouraged by many men and women who have also spoken about their similar experiences.
