         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 2<p>We all know the facts – our skin does more than just hold us together. It waterproofs our internal organs, acts as a barrier against diseases and pollutants and keeps us insulated, especially in the summers. You’ve seen how the models in the fairness cream advertisement have bright and radiant skin, but perhaps what’s most interesting isn’t their shade, but their flawlessly healthy and confident look. A large percentage of us, probably because of those ads, end up buying hundreds of skin care products each year and waste more money than we should. Are hyperpigmentation, early aging, outbreaks or dryness scaring you? Well, fret no more because we have gathered for you a few very simple ways you can keep your skin in ship-shape just by your diet!</p> <h2>Olive oil</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-560.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>There’s no doubting the potential of the little green or sometimes black little ball. Olives are packed with anti-oxidants and according to science, can only do a body good. Olive oil, keeping up with this tradition, has proven to have anti-aging abilities. As per a recent study, olive oil is better than even sunflower or peanut oil when it comes to skincare. Full of monounsaturated fats and antioxidant polyphenols, Olive oil helps keep your skin wrinkle free and firm, because it eliminates the association of free radicals. So, the next time you’re at the supermarket and can’t decide whether your choice of oil should be olive or anything else, hold that thought!</p> <h2>Tomatoes</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-561.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>They say knowledge is knowing tomatoes are fruits, not vegetables. Wisdom is not adding them to the fruit salad! According to dermatologists, tomatoes are beneficial to add into your diet to keep your skin from looking like a tomato itself. Don’t think it’s possible? Well just Google pictures of sunburnt skin and you’ll see the point! Tomatoes are packed with the antioxidant Lycopene which helps increase the skin’s natural SPF. Getting ready for a day at the beach and want to save yourself from crusty skin? Have tomato paste with olive oil beforehand! Add it to your meals from a week or so in advance and you can enjoy healthier skin. Don’t forget your sunscreen though – tomatoes help but don’t heal!</p> <h2>Dark chocolate</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-48.png"/>Shutterstock <p>Well it’s not like chocolate could ever be evil, right? Well get ready for even better news. Dark chocolate can actually aid blood circulation as well as hydration, thanks to its rich sweet taste, which is present because of Flavanols. Also full of antioxidants, dark chocolate is very helpful in fighting cancer cells and helps fight scaliness and dryness of the skin. Just be sure to eat only in moderation though, as having too much can make you gain weight. Doctors recommend having a 1-ounce portion, which is the equivalent of about 150 calories. Already headed for the fridge aren’t you? Bite that bar in the name of science and good skin!</p> <h2>Oatmeal</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-49.png"/>Shutterstock <p>Ah, a warm bowl of oatmeal. Topped with chopped bananas and studded with berries – what a perfect start to the morning! Oatmeal is undoubtedly one of the healthiest things you could have for breakfast and perhaps the most filling too. But what’s it got for your skin? Well it has not one but two main advantages! First off, the refined simple sugars signal your body to produce Insulin, and also boosts the production of Adrenogen. Say goodbye to clogged pores, pimples and those untimely outbreaks. Oatmeal is here to save the day. And oh, save your skin too!</p> <h2>Sardines</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-50.png"/>Shutterstock <p>Sardines are little fish that you can find commonly at any superstore. Canned or fresh, Sardines are packed in good fat and Omega-3s. How is this beneficial for you? Well Omega-3 has been studied by scientists since quite some time and they found it to have anti-inflammatory properties. Inflammation is directly related to acne outbreaks, which no one wants! For clearer and spot-free skin, have some Sardines every now and then. You can thank us later!</p> <h2>Green tea</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-562.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>As if there was any doubt! Green tea has always been known to help digestion and cause even the angriest of men to soothe and calm down, but it does a body good too! Green tea helps maintain the skin’s elasticity and smoothness, thanks to being full of anti-oxidants. What’s more is that it also helps protect against the sun’s harmful U.V. rays which can not only give you a nasty tan, but also have been a leading cause of skin cancer! U.V. protection, smooth skin, elasticity and healthy complexion? We think it’s time for a tea – or should we say green tea, break!</p> <h2>Kale</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-51.png"/>Shutterstock <p>So you’ve been loading up on a tomato and olive-oil rich diet since a few weeks and are ready to hit the beach this weekend, but there’s some bad news. Some U.V. rays can still get through to your skin! But have no fear! Kale is here. Kale neutralizes the free radicals that U.V. light wavelengths can generate inside your skin, which can cause a lot of damage. Kale is probably the most under-rated vegetable ever, because apparently, not a lot of people even know about it. Here’s something to change your mind though. One cup of Kale has 134% of the daily requirement of Vitamin C and 133% of the daily requirement of Vitamin A which helps keep skin hydrated, soft and elastic. Want to make a quick trip to the supermarket now? Hold up, here are more items that should be on your list!</p>     <h2>Walnuts</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-52.png"/>Shutterstock <p>Here’s probably the first good news for any vegetarians reading this, so absorb while it lasts! Walnuts are rich in those Omega-3s we were talking about. As we mentioned, this nutrient is super important for anyone who wants to counter their eczema and dryness of the skin. Winter is right around the corner, fortunately. Walnuts should be your go-to snack!</p> <h2>Orange peels</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-563.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Cancer is definitely something worth going to great lengths to, in order to avoid. According to recent research, three types of people were researched on. Those who loved the fruit, those who enjoyed gulping some pulpy orange juice, and people who ate the peels. Surprisingly, all those who ate orange peels had a 33% decreased chance of getting squamous cell carcinoma, which translates to cancer. This holds true for all kinds of citrus, even including lemon peels. Enjoy your morning marmalade with pride!</p> <h2>Rosemary</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-53.png"/>Shutterstock <p>Rosemary is one of the four herbs that should be eaten often, if you want to save yourself from Melanoma. Rosemary, and all herbs in general, act as anti-oxidants which helps destroy those free radicals generated by U.V. rays, in turn saving you from many dangerous consequences. Melanoma is something you would definitely want to avoid!</p> <h2>Water</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-54.png"/>Shutterstock <p>We know what you’re thinking. Plain water, what a shocker. Well, the thing is, plain water helps your skin appear more plump and fuller. It saves you from your skin looking saggy and dry. So why won’t juice simply do the trick? Here’s the deal. Juice, as we know, contains a lot of sugars which can cause the skin to sag and wrinkle since the sugars inhibit protein and collagen production, in turn damaging your skin’s firmness. When was the last time you had a glass of water? Regardless. Now’s a good time too!</p> <h2>Bell peppers</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-55.png"/>Shutterstock <p>Science can be really complex at times, and you must have already noticed this. Anti-oxidants, free radicals, what is all this? Well there’s no need to revise your chemistry right now because on the other hand, science can be very simple too! How? Scientists say you should have more yellow and green vegetables. Simple as two colors. The benefit? Vegetables with yellow and green colors, especially yellow bell peppers, can actually help prevent aging of the skin and help reduce any visible flaws in the crow’s feet area. Told you the list was going to be long!</p> <h2>Coffee</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-56.png"/>Shutterstock <p>Your morning cup of Joe is apparently more than a good wake up. It’s also a great way to protect your skin against Melanoma, which is basically a kind of skin cancer. According to research, drinking about 6 cups of coffee a day are enough to slash the risks of getting Melanoma by about a whopping 33% itself! However, it goes on to say that the weekly coffee intake should not exceed 28 cups, since that can have more adverse effects than beneficial. As always, moderation is key!</p> <h2>Eggs</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-57.png"/>Shutterstock <p>Do you have an omelet for breakfast? Eggcellent We’re eggcited to tell you it has eggstraordinary benefits for your skin! Eggs offer a good dose of protein as compared to fats as per a pound-for-pound comparison. Fats, as we already know, are albeit important, sometimes rather detrimental for the skin because they promote aging and wrinkling of the skin. Eggs, on the other hand, offer a very healthily balanced portion of protein, which is good for skin, and fats, which are good only in a certain limit, so go for those eggs every day! You know what they say. If your omelet isn’t turning out perfect, scrambled eggs it is!</p> <h2>Pumpkin</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-58.png"/>Shutterstock <p>Steamed, broiled, stewed or boiled. Any way you eat that pumpkin, you’re always in for a healthy serving of beta-carotene, a vital Vitamin we haven’t yet seen any other food giving us. Beta-carotene is basically converted by the body into Vitamin A, and half a cup of cooked pumpkin is worth 400% of your daily Vitamin A needs! Your mom sounds really right now, doesn’t she? Should have started eating your pumpkin a long time ago!</p> <h2>Chickpeas</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-59.png"/>Shutterstock <p>Have you ever heard of a glycemic diet? Well a high-glycemic diet can often result in painful pimples, red spots and acne outbreaks due to a rapid increase in the blood sugar levels and consequently high Insulin levels to follow. Hormonal change is also expected to accompany this. A low-glycemic diet however, does the opposite, and there’s probably no better way of maintain a low-glycemic diet than chickpeas. High in protein and fiber, these slow down digestion favorably and lower the blood sugar response, making your skin smooth and bump free!</p>     <p>So there you go! Here are some very easy additions to your diet that ensure smooth and radiant skin. Think you’ll implement this soon? Share it with your friends and let us know of your results!</p>   <i></i>
