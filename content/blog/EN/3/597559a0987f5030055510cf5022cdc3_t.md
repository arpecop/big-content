She had previously been married for about two years between 2011 and 2013 to Hollywood film producer Trevor Engelson. The couple had been dating for seven years before taking the plunge, however things began to fall apart due to the fact that the couple found it extremely tough to maintain a healthy long distance relationship.</p> <p>Her husband was based in Los Angeles while she had to move out to Toronto for work reasons as the hit show was shot in the Canadian city. The couple divorced after having been married for about two years. The court documents revealed that the couple had cited the problem being that the couple had irreconcilable differences as the reason for parting ways.</p> <p>The couple has been dating since June last year. However the suits actress and duchess to be did not talk about the relationship in public until September, 2017 when she spoke about her relationship with Prince Harry. In November she finished shooting for the seventh season of the show suits. This is the last season in which Meghan will be seen by her fans due to the fact that she has announced that she is turning her back on her acting career. Undoubtedly her fans will miss her dearly on screen. She will now focus on philanthropic and chartable duties like other members of the Royal family. She will also accompany her husband and help him in carrying out his royal duties.</p> <p>The couple is expected to be bestowed the noble titles of Duke and Duchess of Sussex. She has also left her apartment in Toronto which she had kept since 2011 because of the shooting of suits. Now after marriage the couple is expected to move into Nottingham Cottage in Kensington Palace a far cry from the past few years she has spent living in an apartment in Toronto.</p> <p>The couple met thanks to some mutual friends. Prince Harry however had taken a fancy to the American actress long before he had actually met her. He liked her from suits and had told his friends he thought she was the ideal woman.</p> <p>Becoming Princess Meghan however is not an automatic process. For instance the wife of Prince Harry‚Äôs older brother the second in line to the throne Prince William is married to Kate Middleton. She is the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess of Wales however she is not Princess Catherine.</p>     <p>Similarly the late Lady Diana was also not Princess Diana although she often referred to as such. She was also the Princess of Wales. Meghan‚Äôs status is a princess is not yet clear but in all likelihood she will not become Princess Meghan.</p>   <i></i>
