         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 0<p>Relationships are tricky, even more so in the modern world. You have to put in your best effort, and also expect a little something in return. It’s a delicate balance of self-respect and love for the other person, among many other things. However, in this effort to have a meaningful relationship, we may come across some very ugly experiences.</p> <p>One of these quiet killers is known as the silent treatment. This may come as a surprise because it’s not physical aggression, not verbal attacks. While these two are also worrying elements in any relationship, the silent treatment isn’t any better. In fact, many experts assert that the silent treatment is actually a form of emotional abuse. We’ll break it down further below:</p> <p>From the points here, you now know that the silent treatment is actually one of the worst paths to take. when you’re in a relationship, respect the other’s self-worth in every way. The best path is hence to talk it out. if you simply don’t feel like talking, take a walk or get some space otherwise. however, emotionally hurting the other person is just going to doom your bond.</p> <h2>19. What Children Feel</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-992.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Experts have now found out that children actually prefer scolding and yellings to the silent treatment. Since kids are bundles of raw emotions, one can gauge that the silent treatment is a pretty rough choice.</p> <p>In case you needed another example, notice what the utmost punishment is in any prison drama. That’s right: isolation. If a prisoner behaves badly, he or she goes in solitary confinement. In fact, those guilty of such heinous crimes as murder and rape are put in isolation most of the time. this is because lack of human contact is right up there with the heaviest punishment one can have.</p> <h2>18. The Pressing Heartache</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-993.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You may be receiving the silent treatment, and hence rush to make your significant other happy. however, this is a really unhealthy way to reach a reconcilement. This is because the silence weighs so heavily on your heart that you can’t bear it.</p> <p>Even after the matter is patched up, the heartache doesn’t wholly go away. There’s a gap created and it causes a distance between two people. With the silent treatment, one person is being shut out without any regard or sympathy. This is highly disrespectful and unfeeling.</p> <h2>17. The Control Factor</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-994.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>It is very likely that your partner is using the silent treated to get what they want. This is a means of controlling the other person and making them do something they may not want to. Instead of talking to them about it, the silent treatment comes up.</p> <p>Of course, this means that the situation only gets worse. The person on the receiving end may break down, but the cost is huge. They would not stick around for long after that if they can help it.</p> <h2>16. Not Caring to Share</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-995.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Remaining silent when you’re angry or just sulky is a way to not share with your partner. This is a great pity because your significant other is someone you share everything with. This includes your future, your children, and your family. So why should anyone adopt the silent treatment and actively choose not to share what they found lacking in their partner?</p> <p>Basically, a proper connection is made when both parties share with each other. The silent treatment is hence a form of abuse to the relationship as well as to the other person. sharing your feelings and letting them out is what would make you feel better. Alternatively, you can also choose to overcome your feelings and not let them change your behavior.</p> <h2>15. The Blame Game</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-996.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>When one is giving the silent treatment, they are also blaming the other person for their problem. In reality, this problem belongs to them and they should be handling it. This is the path of least resistance for them. by blaming their partner, they don’t have to fix their own flaws.</p> <p>When one person pushes blame on another, the silent treatment may be a way of ignoring the problem. They may also be too immature to talk things out and are simply stewing in silent anger. This does nothing but invite even more negative energy into the relationship.</p> <p>At the end of the day, the blaming kind of silent treatment is little more than an excuse. It’s a way for people to avoid their own responsibility and ignore the mistakes they’ve made. They also don’t want to deal with any questioning or impending drama.</p> <h2>14. Hurting for the Heck of it</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-997.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Remaining stubbornly silent could also be a sign that your partner just wants to hurt your feelings. You ask them something; they pointedly ignore you. This is demeaning and directly saddens you. That’s exactly what they want.</p> <p>There could be many reasons for your partner wanting to hurt you. However, they are all extremely unhealthy reasons; basically excuses for their selfishness. These could include wanting to punish you for some assumed fault; wanting control over you, or to incite pity.</p> <h2>13. Teaching a Lesson, in a Very Wrong Way</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-998.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>One even scarier reason for the silent treatment is that the perpetrator thinks they’re right. They may even think that they’re teaching their partner a lesson. It could be the way the silent treatment seems to work in getting what they want. alternatively, it could just be one way of hurting the other person until they act in an approved manner.</p> <p>This, however, does not mean that ignoring always has a bad sentiment behind it. It could simply mean that your partner wants some space. However, they should be honest and upfront about this need instead of expecting you to read their mind.</p> <h2>12. Inducing Trauma</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-999.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>We know that traumatic incidents like accident or war cause a lot of stress. In some unfortunate cases, PTSD may also become a problem later on. It is now proven that constant silent treatment inflicts a similar sort of trauma on the victim.</p> <p>As a result of this treatment, the victim could suffer from a range of negative emotions including frustration, anger, guilt, confusion, and even depression. Isolation and nervousness are just two more feelings that we can all do without. Taken together, this is simply not a good way to live your life.</p> <p>The silent treatment actively ignores a person’s whole existence. Their feelings are not taken into account. This devalues them in their own eyes. One thus tends to suffer a lot of trauma from their loved one’s silence.</p> <h2>11. Stressed on the Inside</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1000.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>As we have already covered, the silent treatment causes a wide range of negative emotions. This can seriously stress out the victim mentality. In many cases, this treatment is a way to psychologically manipulate the other person into acting a certain way.</p>     <p>The effect of the silent treatment is similar to that of ostracism, banishment, and exile. These were the biggest punishment for a criminal in the past. It is also used in the current times for an extremely hardened criminal. A person in a relationship does not deserve that from the most important individual in their life.</p> <p>What’s more, if the silent treatment goes on for a long time, the effects could be even worse. The victim may end up feeling like they can never be in control. This leads to feelings of dependence, under-confidence, and a lack of general awareness. If anyone uses the silent treatment on children, they should be aware that these negative effects could become permanent.</p> <h2>10. The Side Effects</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1001.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Some may be surprised to know that the silent treatment could have a physical aftermath too. Our brains have a certain part that lets us feel a range of pain levels. This is the anterior cingulated cortex. When one is a victim of the silent treatment, this part is activated.</p> <p>This means that the victim of silent treatment could feel just as much as from a beating. What’s more, these feelings could lead to extremely serious problems. These include eating disorders, high blood pressure, urinary infections, heart diseases, and even cancer.</p> <h2>9. Self-Victimization</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1002.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Those who stay silent out of stubbornness often want to prove something. Most likely, they want to portray themselves as the victim. In actual fact, it is probably the other way round.</p> <p>They may also want to deny that there is something wrong. This serves to negate your own feelings if you’re on the receiving end.</p> <h2>8. Changing Behaviour</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1003.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>When someone receives the silent treatment, their first reaction is worry. They then try to make up for their assumed misbehavior by doing things outside of the norm. They may even end up compromising their own values. For instance, a career woman could give up her job if her husband constantly sulks when she’s home late.</p> <p>In such a case, the victim is blaming him or herself. They then question themselves and end up decreasing the quality of their own lives. In fact, they might even feel like their very survival is at stake. Needless to say, the feeling of being constantly threatened is not something you want in any relationship.</p> <h2>7. Destruction Abounds</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1004.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>When the silent treatment affects a relationship, it eats away like rot in a tree. The relationship might seem perfect to other people, but it is hollow on the inside. If one or both parties use it as a deadly weapon, they would rarely stay together for long. If they do, they probably won’t be happy.</p> <h2>6. Not Compromising</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1005.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>When someone chooses the silent treatment instead of communication, they are actively choosing not to compromise. This does not mean that they are sure of themselves. rather, they are so insecure that they cannot imagine giving way to the person they claim to love.</p> <p>Such people may not want to hurt you. If this is the case they would respect your wishes if you want to talk things out. However, if they ignore your attempts at reconciliation, they’re simply not worth it. In such cases, don’t return the silent treatment in kind but go about your life. it’s possible they may patch up themselves, or else let the relationship end.</p> <h2>5. Refusing to Understand</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1006.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>The one giving silent treatment is usually not interested in reaching an understanding. They might be enjoying the reactions too much, or the power they wield with their silence. If they refuse to discuss the issue at all, this is when you know things aren’t going well.</p> <p>There is a limit to the patience one practices with such individuals. There is only so much time you can give before it’s too late.</p> <h2>4. Respect Yourself</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1007.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>If you’re noticing a consistency in the silent treatments, know that you are the most important person to yourself. No one deserves to be treated like this. If you are ignored, you are still there and your choices do matter.</p> <p>The victim of the situation should respect them above all. If they are receiving this treatment on a regular basis, they should try to distract themselves. Running after the person who is hurting them would never make things better.</p> <h2>3. Keep Your Cool</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1008.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>The best way to deal with silent treatment is to relax yourself first. It doesn’t matter if you’re the one giving it or receiving it. As someone who loves someone else, you need to let go of your ego. Apologize for the sake of the bond you share, and converse like adults. At the end of the day, the relationship matters more than pride.</p> <h2>2. When is it not Silent Treatment</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1009.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>After all these points on silent treatment as emotional abuse, there should be a disclaimer. Silence is not always unproductive, nor does it have to have some agenda. It may simply be that your partner is unhappy and doesn’t know how to convey it.</p> <p>Silence may also be a way for some people to cool off or end a fight. They may be simply waiting for the other person to pick up the conversation in a nicer manner. However, we would still stress here that communication is key. If the silence periods are getting longer and more frequent, it’s a definite red flag. It may be time to force a talk even if you have to visit a counselor.</p> <h2>1. The Punishment of Silence</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1010.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com     <p>Like it or not, the silent treatment is probably a form of punishment. Just because there is no verbal or physical abuse doesn’t mean everything is hunky dory. There are several kinds of abuse, and the emotional kind can be shattering for a victim. It’s high time we took this problem seriously and see proper dialogue as the way to reconcile misunderstandings.</p>   <i></i>
