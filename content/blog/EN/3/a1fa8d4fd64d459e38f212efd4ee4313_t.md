There was a definite impact of it in our daily lives and like other areas dating scenario also got impacted in a major way.</p> <p>One may think it is less than a couple of decades back but that is ancient if we take into account the leaps and bounds with which technology is progressing. The fashion trends of 90s may resurface and get inspired again but as far as dating someone goes it is safer to just ditch the outdated trends.</p> <p>Following are few of the popular flirting fads and trends of 90s which should belong to that era only.</p> <h2>5. Writing letters to your beloved</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1065.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>Since cellphones were not that common and messaging was unheard of so the best and most personal way of telling your special someone about your feelings for them was through a letter.</p> <p>Transferring all your emotions from your heart onto the paper and then posting it with anticipation for a reply from their side.</p> <p>Nowadays if someone decided to mail their potential date a letter they might not even get a reply or worst get rejected for being lame. Why go to all this trouble now when you could instantly message them and hear from them real quick.</p> <h2>4. Learning about an individual through their friends</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1066.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>Nowadays if we are really interested in an individual and feel a need to know them better we can simply go online and see their social media. Their facebook, twitter usage will give us a pretty fair idea of their preferences and inclinations.</p> <p>This was not so simple back in the day when social media was not that popular. If a person wanted to get to know the other person better they actually approached the person’s close friends. It required tact and one needed to act quite cool and ask in an offhand way so as to appear distant and uninterested.</p> <p>One needed to skill the art of extracting information through conversation alone. If you opted for this approach in this time and age you might be seen as a creep and avoided.</p>     <h2>3. Dedicating songs to the person you liked on radio</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1067.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>Since iPods and mp3 players were not that common and tuning into radio was still mainstream, so there was this trend of requesting songs on the radio for the person you loved.</p> <p>It was an adorable way to hope that while you give your shout out to that special someone they might be tuned in as well.</p> <p>With the internet radio and instant music streaming services this is a thing of the past but if you really believe you might feel a little better about yourself by all means request away.</p> <h2>2. Arranging a mixtape for them</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1068.jpeg"/>shutterstock <p>Another endearing trend of the 90s was to know about the music your partner liked to listen and arrange all those songs on a cassette.</p> <p>This kind of a gift was something which required much thought and was considered very romantic. The songs would also be chosen based on how the person felt about their beloved and their relationship.</p> <p>The idea is still very impressive to dismiss, just take care not to go with a cassette tape. You might make them a digital playlist on Spotify instead of handing down an ancient piece of cassette tape screaming of antiquity.</p> <h2>1. Movie night meant trip down to the Blockbuster Stores</h2>      <p> They still exist! #blockbusterstore #movieday</p> <p>A post shared by Karl Pads (@_karlwithakay) on Oct 24, 2012 at 2:26pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>There was no ‘Netflix and Chill’ in the 90s and if you and your partner had a movie night the only option was to make your way to the nearest Blockbuster Stores.</p> <p>It was your only option to rent out the latest flicks or better yet take your partner with you to the store and decide there.</p>     <p>At least the experience was a whole lot exciting than just sitting in front of your T.V scrolling through the available options.</p>   <i></i>
