         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 0<p>Sometimes we are just waiting to be surprised by something amazing; everyone loves to see some unbelievable stuff now and then. Different things astonish different people, for some, it may be as small as juggling two balls for them to be impressed while for some it may take pulling a whole airplane by yourself. Here are some astonishing photos that you may have to look at twice just to be sure, I am sure you will love it.</p> <h2>26. Invisible Hockey Player</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-317.jpeg"/>Mighty Optical Illusions <p>This is one of the most bizarre pictures you will ever see. It is a picture of two players of Ice Hockey fighting against each other long the stands. The thing that is crazy about this picture is that one of the player’s head seems to be missing which is very difficult to grasp. It looks like there is an invisible layer fighting. I bet it will be hard to win against him.</p> <h2>25. The Invisible Truck</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-318.jpeg"/>Mighty Optical Illusions <p>Not every day do we get to see an invisible car out in the lawn now, do we? The truck is so shiny that it is completely being reflected. The only part you can see is the tires. The rest of the truck is being reflected with the lawn, and it looks like it is just grass and leaves.</p> <h2>24. Half Waiter Half Woman</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-320.jpeg"/>Mighty Optical Illusions <p>This picture looks as if this person has a man’s body and a woman’s legs. Upon closer inspection, we realize that it is only the mirror underneath the counter that tricks us. What a relief.</p> <h2>23. Girl Road Illusion</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-322.jpeg"/>Imgur <p>This stunning optical fantasy of a young lady on the way is making rounds on the Internet. Business Week claims that this acrylic painting is a spoof of the best-known work of Kaii Higashiyama, a noteworthy figure in present-day Japanese painting. Makoto Aida was at a misfortune what to do in the wake of moving on from a renowned artistry school in 1991 and took about a year to paint this photo.</p> <h2>22. og Face</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-324.jpeg"/>Mighty Optical Illusions <p>This is a picture of a woman holding a dog that looks like a hybrid of their face like both their faces are merged as one.</p> <h2>21. Korean Make-up Artist</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-326.jpeg"/>Designdain / Instagram <p>What an amazing makeup to fool us completely, it looks like she has both her hands on her face and still managing to take a picture which is practically impossible. In reality, she only has one hand on her face and one taking the selfie.</p> <h2>20. Hungry Tiger</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-328.jpeg"/>Mighty Optical Illusions <p>It looks like this man is going to get eaten by a giant tiger behind him but this is actually just a picture, and the man looks pretty calm enough that he is not going to get eaten so why worry then.</p> <h2>19. Fake Beard Illusion</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-330.jpeg"/>Borzoi.tumblr.com via Pinterest <p>This man looks like as he has one of the longest beards in the world but watching closely you find out that it is the woman standing in front of the man at such a perfect angle that her hair looks like his beard. Great stuff.</p> <h2>18. Lifting Car on Shoulders</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-332.jpeg"/>Taringa.net <p>Ever tried lifting a car on your shoulders? Well do not try it and probably this guy never will too if he’s smart enough. The car is in the back, and the man is just lifting nothing basically, great acting by him and awesome capture by the photographer though.</p> <h2>17. Standing on Plastic Cup</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-334.jpeg"/>Illusions Point <p>On first look, it may seem that this woman has completely shrunken down that she can easily stand on the cup or the cup may have become so big that she is standing on it. Both are apparently false as the woman is standing far behind the cup, it is all about the perspective.</p> <h2>16. Looking Forward or to the Left</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-337.jpeg"/>Kickassgreekpaddledesigns.wordpress.com <p>This one is a real tough one, one point you will say that the man is looking sideways but on the contrary, one may even argue that he is looking forward. It is all about the perspective. I will leave it to you to sort it out.</p> <h2>15. Weird Stairs</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-340.jpeg"/>Mighty Optical Illusions <p>This is one real wacky and weird type of stairs that you do not see in a common house. Strange design of the stairs or just another illusion. See for yourself.</p> <h2>14. Sea Angel</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-342.jpeg"/>AmazingPics <p>You may have certainly heard about angels, whether you believe in them or not is entirely up to you. However, one thing is for certain that you do not believe in this angel. But still it is such an amazing picture, the woman flaps her arms in the air, and it actually looks like wings made of water.</p>     <h2>13. Dice Triangle</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-344.jpeg"/>OnextraPixel <p>Another amazing example of the optical illusion, you have to keep looking at this picture, again and again, to check how the dice have been placed and still you may never find out.</p> <h2>12. Eifel Tower Face</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-346.jpeg"/>Oddee <p>Eifel tower is one of the most amazing monuments of the world; you may have seen a lot of pictures of it. But you may never have seen the Eifel Tower from this angle. The reflections and the background make it look it is a woman’s face. Remarkable illusion.</p> <h2>11. 3D Rubik’s Cube</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-348.jpeg"/>JustSomething <p>We have all heard of the Rubik’s Cube. You may not necessarily know how to solve it, but you probably would have been fooled by this 3D sketch of a Rubik’s cube on a piece of paper. From one angle it looks like there is a real Rubik’s cube rig there on the table, but as soon as you turn the page, you find out how wrong you were.</p> <h2>10. Camel Trees</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-350.jpeg"/>Funcage <p>This is a fantastic picture of two trees coming together that it feels like there is a camel standing there. It is extraordinary how much the trees resemble the shape of a camel.</p> <h2>9. Double Headed Zebra</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-352.jpeg"/>Anfal via Pinterest <p>Is this a picture of a zebra with two heads on either side of his body? Oh wait those are two Zebras. Would have been really hard to tell in the first look but watching it closely you know it is impossible for a Zebra to have two heads.</p> <h2>8. Caterpillar Birds</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-354.jpeg"/>reddit <p>Caterpillars are one of those insects that are hated but as soon as they become a butterfly everyone adores their beauty. This may look like a caterpillar from a fair distance, but it is actually a group of cute birds tightly packed together.</p> <h2>7. Skull Flower</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-356.jpeg"/>Stuffpoint <p>A skull on the flower, how often do you see something like that! This is probably the flower you would want to give someone you hate or to scare the soul out of someone. This would also be a great thing to carry on Halloween to go trick-or-treating.</p> <h2>6. Catching Person in Mouth</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-358.jpeg"/>Pinterest <p>I can bet that you never caught a person in your mouth, it is impossible of course. This is a picture of an army man trying to catch a man from a helicopter straight into his mouth. Great try, but we all know what that is.</p> <h2>5. Holding Skier with One Hand</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-359.jpeg"/>LolWot <p>Have you ever tried lifting someone straight up in the air with the strength of just one hand? This looks like similar to that, but it is a perfectly captured shot of the skiers. Skiers jump pretty high during stunts, and you may find a lot of similar pictures of skiers floating in the air. If this picture made you look twice to see what is really happening, then they succeeded in fooling you.</p> <h2>4. Half Disappearing Girl</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-360.jpeg"/>MoiIllusions <p>A girl that has no body, this would give you nightmares. But it is good to find out that it is all because of the mirror that she is holding in her hand. Reflecting the grass and making her seem half invisible.</p> <h2>3. Many Legged Bird</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-361.jpeg"/>Stuffpoint     <p>This is a picture of a mother bird, hugging all her babies to keep them warm. But at first look, this may not seem like it. It does look like this bird has many legs which are not true by any means of course.</p> <h2>2. The exorcism</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-362.jpeg"/>Imgur <h2>1. Walking on water</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-363.jpeg"/>imgur   <i></i>
