So now if you ask how many materials or items did she require? Just two. An ordinary $6 Yoga mat and duct tape.</p> <p>The process involved several steps. First step was creating the outline of the costume using duct tape, tracing the Yoga mat and to form the base of the costume. While explaining the process, she said, “’Basically I started by duct taping myself then I cut out a pattern from the duct tape form, copied it onto a Kmart yoga mat and glued it together using contact adhesive.” Although it sounds easy, it requires an amazing level of skill to able to pull these items together and give them shape.</p> <p>The pictures show that the costume is extremely detailed but similar carvings as on the Yoga mat acted portrayed the look of a metallic breast plate. ‘I then used thin craft foam to make the eagle and belt and attached it, spray painted it and then hand painted in the details,’ Rhylee said.</p>      <p> Finished Wonder Woman costume!! #wonderwoman #wonderwomancosplay #halloween #dc #dccomics #superhero #galgadot #makeup #costume #cosplay #justiceleague #jlhalloween #picoftheday #photooftheday #photography #tagsforlikes #love @justiceleague @gal_gadot</p>     <p>A post shared by Rhylee Passfield (@rermakeup) on Nov 3, 2017 at 2:44am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>“I made it curved with a heat gun and I used a fake nail to make the pattern on the breastplate.” Heat gun and nail were the only tools she used.</p> <p>‘I also used some scrap vinyl from a cheap shop for the skirt and glued it onto some boyleg underwear,’ Rhylee said.</p> <p>“I then got some shoes from an op shop and painted them.” She went all out when she even bought the shoes from the store.</p> <p>“All up the costume cost me about $30 and took about 50 hours as it was my first time making anything like it.” 50 hours of work is like working for 7 hours a for a week!</p>      <p> Hello here is my face</p> <p>A post shared by Rhylee Passfield (@rermakeup) on Jun 11, 2017 at 4:38am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>In one of her Instagram posts she says, “One of my biggest coping mechanisms for mental health is my art, which is what lead me to this, it enables me to express myself healthily and calm me down.
