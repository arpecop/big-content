And we don’t mean in the romantic sense. It leaves a lot of questions unanswered and can be terrible for those left behind. Simply put, suicide should never have to be the only option, and it rarely is. However, there definitely needs to be more awareness on the subject.</p> <p>Part of understanding suicide comes from looking at what the victim did for a living. This may seem irrelevant, but work is a major factor in anyone’s life. We are at work for quite a few hours every day. It’s something we need, and not everyone loves their job. Even if they do, some jobs are so high-pressure that they could end up affecting an individual’s state of mind. Below are some jobs that seem to have the highest chances of suicide:</p> <h2>20. The Competition in Science</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1209.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Scientists, especially natural scientists, are under great pressure within their profession. They have to be innovative all the time. Publishing their findings can be quite a hassle, not to mention the political side of it.</p> <p>There is also a lot of competition in this field. If a scientist is truly passionate, he or she wouldn’t ever stop working. No wonder the term ‘mad scientist’ can into being. The job itself is enough to drive anyone to the verge of suicide and over it.</p> <h2>19. Blue Lives at Risk</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1210.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Children idealize police officers, but it’s a very stressful job when you look at it. Catching criminals is often a very tough task, depending more on luck than anything else. There is also the danger of getting shot or seriously hurt when on duty.</p> <p>Police officers also work odd hours for long periods of time, and they experience tragedy and loss on a daily basis. It can’t be easy looking at car wrecks, fires, and hearing about murder and kidnappings every day. It may all become too much to handle in the end.</p> <h2>18. The Profits Come at a Price</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1211.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Stockbrokers are able to earn huge amounts of money at a time. This counts for a lot, but it doesn’t always compensate for the constant high pressure.</p> <p>The stock market can be very fickle and unpredictable. External influences can cause rates to skyrocket or plunge. In the case of the latter occurring, stockbrokers could incur huge losses. Worrying about this alone could put one in depression. Experiencing it could mean seeing life as worthless, and eventually ending it.</p> <h2>17. The Weight of the Law</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1212.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Lawyers could be the superheroes of the modern world if they work honestly. However, the pay associated with this work does nothing to alleviate the feelings of pressure.</p> <p>Lawyers have to constantly put everything else on hold when on a case. This could mean jeopardizing their family and social lives. Then again, they may sometimes have to defend someone who is guilty, which goes against their natural moral compass. This can be quite a frustrating and challenging task and can end in tragedy.</p> <h2>16. Farming Losses</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1213.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Farmers shouldn’t be on the list, right? They get up early, eat healthy, and should live to a ripe old age in that natural environment.</p> <p>Sadly, it is this very environment that gets to many farmers. Weather and climate are ever-changing, and farmers can lose all their hard work with one storm, infestation, or deliberate enmity. Plus, prices of produce can change at the drop of a hat. There should be no surprise then that farmers end up taking their own lives.</p> <p>There is also the disturbing fact that some farmers choose suicide even when they’re not depressed. They choose death in order to support their families, who could then collect their life insurance. This is a heartbreaking tragedy, but one that is very common, especially in developing countries.</p> <h2>15. Construction Pressure</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1214.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Construction site managers are the big boss of the construction field. However, they are also under immense pressure for everything to go just right. There are budgeting issues, tight deadlines, and lots of people to keep happy.</p> <p>All of this put together can become too much for one person to handle. Construction managers may hence see death as an easy way out.</p> <h2>14. Putting on a Brave Face</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1215.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Many of us are still mourning the suicides of our favorite celebrities. Robin Williams is perhaps the most shocking but apt example.</p> <p>As an actor, one is constantly under observation. Those who play villains could end up being hated for her performances. For the funny ones, they are expected to be cheerful and happy all the time. Both are extremes that human beings find unable to stand at times.</p> <h2>13. Needing Constant Affirmation</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1216.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Along with actors, musicians are also leading double lives. The happiness and inspiration they have to fake most often get them right where it hurts. In fact, there may be some personal trauma that got musicians into this career in the first place.</p> <p>Depressed people often crave a lot of attention. They get that as musicians, but they may soon realize that their adorers are not people they can rely on. Some may not even realize they are depressed, let alone convey it to their loved ones. Chester Bennington’s shocking suicide earlier this year is probably the most glaring example.</p> <h2>12. Creative Darkness</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1217.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>We’ve all perceived the notion of a depressed writer. Creativity basically comes at a high price. There may even be mental problems with some of the most famous writers to date. This, along with the pressure of writing all the time, may even cause hallucinations. The most well-known examples include Hemingway and his progeny.</p> <h2>11. The Surgeon’s Suffering</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1218.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Surgeons may save lives, but they also see a whole lot of death. There are long hours, mind-bending shifts, and the constant battle with death.</p>     <p>Surgeons often try to distance themselves from their patients as a means of self-preservation. However, it doesn’t always work, and the job itself leads to a high rate of depression and suicide.</p> <h2>10. Heath Care Chances</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1219.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Studies and research on jobs with high suicide rates show that some jobs just have a tendency to attract people who are depressed. Musicians and writers are two examples cited above. However, there are also some jobs that give more chances for suicide.</p> <p>For instance, those in health care know just how to gain death with the least amount of effort and pain. They would also know where and how to get access to lethal substances that other people may not. One example is that of dentists, who are unfortunately very adept when it comes to suicide.</p> <h2>9. The Caregiver’s Isolation</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1220.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>The role of the caretaker is an important one in society. However, since it is essentially a low-skilled job, it also pays less. At the same time, it requires a lot of care, odd hours, and effort. Hence, caregivers may also turn to suicide as a way out of their apparent dead end.</p> <h2>8. Selling their Soul</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1222.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>The rate of suicide among salespeople in inexplicably high. Some may theorize that meeting sales quota is an extremely tough and high-pressure task. In addition to this, it can’t be easy dealing with complaining customers all the time.</p> <p>Salespeople are also slapped with very low salaries and have to work hard for their commissions. If they end up not making enough sales, they may not be able to support themselves. Hence, they are under a lot of stress and worry most of the time. Eventually, the stress could get to them and they may decide to just bow out of life altogether.</p> <h2>7. Commercially Stressed</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1224.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Commercial services have to do with any kind of transportation that is done for profit. However, this involves a lot of responsibility, whether it is millions of dollars’ worth of cargo or human lives.</p> <p>Even a tiny mistake could result in huge and irrecoverable losses. The guilt and loss of reputation could become all too much. As a result, the rate of suicide among those providing commercial services is higher than of those in sales.</p> <h2>6. Machinery Doesn’t Pay</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1226.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Machinery operators have an even higher suicide rate. These are essentially low-paid jobs, but they involve a lot of risk. Historically, people have become dismembered when operating machinery. There is also the chance of paralysis if one is not extremely careful at all times.</p> <p>In addition to this, machine operators are usually paid no more than the basic minimum wage. This could put a whole lot of burden on them to keep working even when they are sick or on medication. Health insurance may not even be an option for them.</p> <h2>5. A Great Supply of Engineers</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1228.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Becoming an engineer requires a lot of hard work both in school and college. However, the supply of engineers is growing every year. Demand, however, is not catching up. It is a standing Internet joke that engineers simply cannot find jobs. The result of this unemployment after years of effort, though, is absolutely no laughing matter.</p> <p>There is also a high level of competition in the field of engineering. This can further lead any engineer to make compromises on the salary offered. This, in turn, leads to a financial void, which increases pressure on them. Since there are usually a lot of expectations from engineers, it’s no wonder that many fall prey to suicidal musings.</p> <h2>4. Change Becomes Too Much</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1230.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Those in the technology and trade industry seem to have it made. After all, this is the time when the tech geek comes to the fore. However, we don’t fully realize the impact of rapidly advancing technology. Many people have poured their money and brainpower into fields that simply aren’t applicable anymore. They are thus out of a job with no future prospects in their specialization.</p> <p>When a technological concept becomes invalid, many businesses shut down. This leads to huge losses for the owner and unemployment for the workers. Even if people in tech and trade have jobs, they have to work a large number of hours to get anywhere. This could lead them to compromise on other aspects of their life. Eventually, the pressure leads to depression and suicide attempts.</p> <h2>3. Trucking isn’t Easy</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1232.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>A truck driver is essentially on his/her own. Moreover, they are in charge of a huge vehicle, with the chances of a breakdown and accident always nearby. Some accidents may be fatal, which could lead the truck driver to suicide over guilt and self-reproach.</p> <p>Even if there are no accidents, the isolated feeling is enough to drive anyone crazy. However, there are still tight deadlines to meet and long, odd hours to work.</p> <h2>2. Physically Going Under</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1234.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Laborers are usually under a lot of physical stress. They are also paid very low wages, which could lead to them working even harder and making their condition worse. Plus, those in hard labor are usually not given protection or even a decent insurance coverage. This may lead to them attempting suicide out of sheer despair.</p> <h2>1. The Sorrow for Animals</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1236.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Veterinarians usually get into this field because of their love and concern for animals. However, the reality of being a vet is really not much fun. Vets may be requested to put down completely healthy animals if their owners don’t want them. Also, they have to see innocent animals in various stages of disease and/or neglect. Even if the animal really is in pain, putting it down is very painful. Death is something vets have to see and deal with almost every time they are on duty.</p> <p>There are only so many animals one can save, and the disturbing sights could become too much for an animal lover. It may be shocking for some to know that this profession is actually at the top for suicide rates in Australia.</p>     <p>There’s probably never one reason why someone chooses to commit suicide. However, when someone is depressed, those who want to help should take a look at the main influences around them. Family is a huge part of someone’s happiness, and so is a job. A little bit of effort and some counseling within some of the jobs above could hopefully lower the high rates of suicide associated with them.</p>   <i></i>
