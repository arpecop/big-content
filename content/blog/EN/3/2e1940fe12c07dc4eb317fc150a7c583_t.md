Well, this teenager has managed to build his very own mini house right in his backyard.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image.jpeg"/>abcnews <p>Ah, middle school, such a carefree and innocent time. I remember having the best time in middle school. Not having to worry about much except who I was going to go to the dance with and what was I going to wear? But, you know what never crossed my mind? Building my own house! Looking back maybe it would have been a good idea, at least I would have my own place!</p> <p>Some kids can really surprise you like Luke Thill, the 13-year-old genius from Dubuque, Iowa, who built his very own cottage in his backyard. The whole project cost him about $1,500 and I must admit I’m a bit envious of how cozy it actually looks.</p> <h2>The Dream</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1.jpeg"/> / YouTube <p>Now, in time where social media is so popping and iPad, PlayStation, and videos games are all the craze, Luke somehow decided he wanted to use his energy on something more productive and old-fashioned like building a tiny house for himself. The idea soon came to life when he decided he didn’t want to end up being bored like last summer. After some much-needed research, he planned out exactly how he was going to build his dream house and sprang into action!</p>     <h2>The Process</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-2.jpeg"/>Wwaytv3.com <p>But, it wasn’t easy, it took Luke about a year to get the money to build the house as well as the right materials. He mowed lawns, ran errands for neighbors that need help and even set up a fundraiser to speed up the process.</p> <p>I’m impressed nowadays kids barely lift a finger and here is Luke promising to take the trash out for a friend who also happens to be an electrician. The electrician made a deal with him that he would hook up his electricity if Luke would take his garbage out.</p> <p>To build the house, Luke used 75% recycled materials, most of them being from his grandmother’s house. His uncle’s friend even gifted him a door for the house!</p> <p>The house is 89-square foot, 10-feet long, and 5 and a half feet wide. There’s electricity but no water yet. That means no bathroom or running water, but there are future plans to add those features on to this totally adorable home.</p> <p>Luke told The Des Moines Register, “I liked the minimalism and I wanted to have a house without a huge mortgage.”</p> <p>He also happens to have a growing Youtube channel where he shows sever clips of the house and how it was built.</p> <p>Now, of course, his parents helped him both financially and to build the house, but they made it a point to make sure their son raised most of the money for his house. They supported his dreams as all good parents should.</p> <p>His father Greg told The Des Moines Register, “It was a chance for a kid to do something more than play video games or sports, it teaches life lessons.”</p> <h2><strong>Teenager’s Dream</strong></h2> <p>The house is a dream come true for all teenagers, kind of like a man-cave, where you can get away and just chill by yourself. The house has a tv, a microwave to heat up pizza, and even a bed! He even has flowers and a barbeque in the back for some good old grilling. Luke usually does his homework in the little cottage and sometimes even spends the night there.</p> <p>As for future plans, well he plans on building another house, but this time bigger and better than ever! He also wants kids to remember that they can do anything if they put their mind to it and to follow their dreams no matter what.</p>     <p>“I want to show kids it’s possible to build at this age.”</p>   <i></i>
