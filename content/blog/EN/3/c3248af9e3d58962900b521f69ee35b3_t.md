         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 0<p>Ever had that nagging feeling that your child is getting smarter than you and soon you’re going to have trouble in trying to keep up with their thought process? Or maybe you feel sluggish and find your brain going hazy at random intervals? We have the perfect solution for you. Logic puzzles have been linked to stimulating brain cells but have also been proven to enhance the human intellectual process significantly. Moreover, solving puzzles leads to increased commitment levels and heightened capacity of psychological endurance.</p> <p>Solving puzzles also leads to a better memory because they require you to remember and reinforce previously forged connections between information, and thus, work to boost the generation of new relationships. Both the remembrance and the formation of new links lead to a greatly enhanced mental speed of thought process. Well, thought out brain puzzles also make people think of different approaches to tackle the same problem. Thinking out of the box while looking for solutions exercises our brains into thinking efficiently when looking for solutions. Puzzles encourage a systematic approach and lead to more innovative problem-solving techniques in the future</p> <p>Puzzles have also been linked to actively contributing towards increased production of dopamine, a hormone also known as the ‘happy hormone.’ Moreover, the invigorating effects of puzzles can also help us relax psychologically by moving the brain into a meditative state. All this makes puzzles a great way to tackle stress and induce a general increase in productivity levels, along with a more tranquil and calm state of mine.</p> <h2>1. The parking spot conundrum</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-01-jpg.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>This seemingly easy puzzle was primarily meant for a first graders entrance exam in Hong Kong. While it took kids only a few minutes to solve, most adults seemed to lag behind.</p> <p>Can’t quite seem to get it? Just turn the picture around in your head and wait for the magic to happen.</p> <h2>2. The 4 digit puzzle</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-02-jpg.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>This notoriously hard puzzle takes preschoolers just a few moment to crack while programmers are left scratching their head for hours.</p> <p>The answer is deceptively simple! All you really need to do is count the number of circles on every 4 digit number. For instance, the digit 6 has one circle, and 8 has two. According to this logic, 2581 has 2 circles while 6889 has a total of 6.</p> <h2>3. The tale of the smart prince</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-03-jpg.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>A king of a wealthy land wants his beloved daughter to wed the smartest of 3 incredibly intellectual young princes. This led to the king’s wise courts men devised an intricately designed intelligence test.</p> <p>All three princes are brought together into one room and seated, facing each other. They are then proceeded to be shown two black and three white hats. The princes are then blindfolded, and a single hat is placed on each of their heads, while the remaining hats are taken away and hidden in a separate room.</p> <p>They are then told that the first prince to figure out the color of his hat without removing it or attempting to look at it will get the honor of marrying the princess. However, a wrong guess will merit certain death. The blindfolds are then taken off.</p> <p>You are one of the princes mentioned above, and you see two white hats on the other prince’s heads. A little time passes, and you realize that the other princes are either unable to figure out the color of their hat, or are unwilling to take a wild guess. What is the color of your hat?</p> <p>At a loss for words?</p> <p>The king, on account of his just character, would stray away from choosing two white hats and one black hat. This would mean that two of the princes would see one black hat and one white hat. This would mean that you would be at a significant disadvantage if you were the only prince wearing a black hat as it would mean the other princes would be able to figure out they were dressed in a white hat. This means that the only way for this test to be fair is for all three princes to wear a white hat.</p> <h2>4. The numerical pyramid</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-04-jpg.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Third graders in Singapore are rumored to be able to solve such puzzles in less than two minutes.</p> <p>The answering values of D and E are 1345 and 2440 respectively. The bottom of the numbers is connected to the top tier, but you need to figure out their connection. Add the numbers on the bottom, and you get 461, which is greater by 15 from its neighbor 446. That’s when you realize that 15 is the magic number here with 15 always being the leftover when you subtract the sum from the neighboring number.</p> <h2>5.

To find out how many caramel candies are in the box; you need to 30 — 10 = 20. For coconut candies do 25 — 10 = 15. Now you can easily figure out how many plain chocolate candies are present in the box! 50 — (20 + 15 +10) = 5</p> <h2>6.The question of the bus</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-06-jpg.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Which way is this bus facing while driving?</p> <p>Basic driving knowledge can get you far in solving this one.
