However, as time went on, ‘finding the one’ started seeming like a foolish childhood fantasy.</p> <p>On the other hand, if you start paying attention to the people around you, you realize that finding your soulmate is a very real possibility, provided you know what the giveaway traits are. Fleeting relationships might come and go, but the feeling of being with someone who you seamlessly connect with is an opportunity of a lifetime.</p> <p>Many people believe that they don’t get a say in choosing their soulmates, in fact, destiny is the driving force bringing them together. However, while destiny plays an undoubtedly large role in finding ‘The One,’ we can never be sure about who is meant to be our forever.</p> <p>Here are some signs that might help you in the process of finding your missing puzzle piece.</p> <h2>10.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1289.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Loyalty is an essential quality to look for in a soulmate. Being sure that your significant other is going to be there for you whenever you need them is paramount to the health of a relationship. It’s easy to be there for someone when everything is going well, however, sticking around when everything is going south is a trait that you need to look out for when searching for the one. If your partner doesn’t give up on you even when things aren’t looking down, the chances are that you have found yourself a keeper.</p> <h2>9.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1291.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>The support that comes from your significant other is vital in relationships. Of all the people in your life, your partner is supposed to be the one who picks you up when you’re feeling down. Not only should they be able to handle you in all situations, but they should be aware of you without you having to tell them. Of all the people you come in contact with in your daily life, your significant other’s support is what really helps you stay afloat in times of need.</p> <h2>8.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1293.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>In the initial stages of your relationship, also known as the talking phase, the both of you probably talked about things like your hobbies and interests and shared your memorable childhood experiences.</p> <p>This small talk is actually a great way to see how compatible you are with another person. While having similar experiences is not essential to finding a soulmate, it helps if you share the same likes and dislikes. Core values, coupled with a similar array of hobbies and interests makes it easier for two people to connect not only on a superficial level but also an emotional level.</p> <p>If two people share the same outlook on life, it minimizes the room for arguments and debates and means you two can get along smoothly and without conflict.</p> <h2>7.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1295.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>It is important for your soulmate to be someone who brings out the best in you. If someone inspires you to be the best that you can constantly be, the chances are that you have stumbled upon your soulmate.</p> <p>This person will never suppress you or try to make you deviate from what you want in your life, but at the same time will make sure to help you onto the path of self-improvement. Instead of trying to change you, they will act as a catalyst and help propel you into the life that you have always wanted for yourself.</p>     <h2>6.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1297.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>You can be sure of the fact that you have found someone who is potentially your soulmate if your communication with them is consistent. While all couples have their own sets of hurdles, accompanied by varying ups and downs, making sure that you communicate with each other through it all is extremely important.</p> <p>If you are with someone who listens to all that you have to say without any judgment or criticism and gives you their honest and valuable opinion, never let them go! An honest and understanding partner is the stuff dreams are made of.</p> <h2>5.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1298.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>We all have our own definition of feeling loved which might vary greatly not only across people but also across partners. However, one thing is for sure, in a relationship all one wants is to feel like their truly special and one of a kind. While your partner might associate feeling loved with something that is entirely different from your definition, they will be great at being able to hone in on your exact needs and fulfill them without making you feel clingy or needy.</p> <p>At the end of the day, they would do anything to make you feel warm and fuzzy, and that’s what makes them your perfect soulmate.</p> <h2>4.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1299.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Given that you’re in the right relationship, your partner will feel most likely never tire of your constant love and affection. Your soulmate won’t think of affection as something that needs to be portioned and given at certain times.</p> <p>Your soulmate will appreciate all that you have to give, regardless of the time and place. They will want all that you have to give, anywhere and everywhere. Not only will they be happy to give you the love and attention that you crave and deserve, but they will just as keenly be on the receiving end. If they can never have enough of you, you have got yourself a soulmate for life.</p> <h2>3.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1300.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>No matter what the circumstances, someone who is meant for you will find you irresistible. It does not matter if you have gone without a shower for days and your hair is a tangled mess, or if they caught you in the middle of a rom-com marathon with your eyeliner wreaking havoc all over your face, they would still find you to be all that is good in the world. Even when you have trouble finding beauty within yourself, your soulmate will.</p> <h2>2.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1301.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>Everywhere we turn, there are things that threaten to disturb the comfort of our lives. Ranging from people to circumstances, everything has the ability to impact us negatively. All this negativity can drain you out, making the future look dismal and bleak. However, spending time with your soulmate can change that.</p> <p>Not only will your soulmate be able to shield you from all the negative vibes the world exudes, but they will also make sure to never be someone who is exposing you to negativity. They will flood you with positivity and continue to be your safe space whenever things get hard.</p> <h2>1.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1302.jpeg"/>Tapoos <p>A relationship, especially a romantic one, is nothing without trust. If you don’t trust the person you’re with, chances are they are not someone you envision yourself to be with forever. With all the temptations that surround us on a daily basis, it can get very easy to over think yourself into fearing the worst when it comes to your significant other.</p>     <p>However, if you are with your soulmate, they will make an active effort to be someone you can trust inexplicably, effectively putting all your trust issues to rest once and for all.</p>   <i></i>
