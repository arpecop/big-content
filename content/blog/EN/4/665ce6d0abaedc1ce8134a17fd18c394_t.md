         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -3<p>Let’s face facts here – men wear jeans all the time. From that old and distressed pair you bought three years ago to that crisp new pair of 511s that you only wear at select occasions, you know you’re guilty of hoarding up. And why not be, right? If those old slacks are old enough to retire, they’ll be converted into three-quarters and then shorts, so why worry, eh?</p> <p>For any ladies reading this, here’s an apology on behalf of all us men. The thing is though, would you deny seeing your significant other in jeans more than anything else? From that dinner you guys had at your parents’ to that match you went to see. From that office picnic to the last parent-teachers’ conference your kids had, jeans were worn and eyes were rolled. Now that we’ve established the very inevitability of this tough and hardy garment, let’s get you to some facts that will help you up your denim game and let you stay stylish without breaking the bank!</p> <h2>No curves, no problem</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2286-1-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Women are often known for accentuating their curves and flaunting their style when picking out clothes. From making their waists look as narrow as possible to making their dressing as modest and elegant as possible, women really like to go all-in when it comes to dressing. Men, on the other hand, not so much. When it comes to men and denim, men look good in any fit of denim. This is not to be confused with saying every fit suits every man, but the general rule is that all men look just fine in every style of jeans off the shelves, as long as there’s enough flexibility and practicality. Gentlemen, when picking out the perfect pair of jeans, always have the day you’re going to break into them in mind!</p> <h2>The Wash</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2286-2-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Men are simple beings – we see our favorite color and we pick it off the shelves. Shampoo, toothpaste, shower gel, soap or anything else. However, it is to be noted, with severe caution that this should stop when it comes to denim. Denim, as we have agreed, is a very versatile fabric which can grace you as your bottoms in a variety of ways. Dress it up with a pair of boots and matching belt exposed with the shirt tucked in, and you’ve got yourself a nice and tidy look. This is as formal as jeans can be. Or, on the flipside, you could throw on some sandals (No socks!) and a nice T-shirt and you’ve got yourself a casual and weekending look. But wait – how can both these looks come with the same pair of jeans? The answer is – the Wash.</p> <p>When picking out the perfect pair of jeans you need to only answer the two questions necessary which unlock your jeans’ next level. The first one is, is the wash dark enough? See, you kind of always want to go for the darker wash. Unless you’ve already got an outfit in mind which only works with something lighter, you want dark. This not only makes your legs look leaner and longer, but also give you more wears since small stains won’t show all too easily on a dark wash. The second question is, does it have too much whiskering or extreme fading? We’ve all seen one of those dudes too many who radiates swag with his super faded and whiskered jeans, with the whites going all over the groin and thigh area. You want the exact opposite. Minimum of both those ‘decorations’!</p> <h2>The rise</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-old-2286-3-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>While we’re on the topic of bad examples, try to recall. Have you ever seen guys who wear their jeans too low and it always looks like they’re walking around with a full diaper? Or, conversely, have you ever seen that guy who has trouble walking because of how limited room is available the between his waist and groin of his jeans? He’s constantly twitching and stepping side to side to adjust his gait. Polar opposites as they may be, they both have one thing in common – very badly calculated rise. The rise, as you may have figured out by now, is the space between the lowest stitch in the groin area and the highest point of the waist area. This needs to be perfect.</p> <p>How?</p> <p>Simple.</p> <p>Always try on your jeans before paying up and leaving the store. Yes they may have an exchange policy but why waste time on that when you could have nailed it in the first go? Always try to go for a medium rise and always walk around the store when you’re shopping for jeans. Do a squat, raise your legs, fill up your pockets with things you usually fill them up with, and try to figure out whether on a highly active day, you wouldn’t mind if you were in these jeans. Rise problem solved!</p>     <h2>The length</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-old-2286-4-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Have you ever noticed how the right pair of jeans can make even someone who isn’t exactly very tall look like they’ve gained a few inches? Or have you ever noticed how you look much shorter and stubbier when you wear your favorite pair of baggy jeans? This is all because of the length of the jeans. When it comes to the length, you want to have only one thing on your mind – how many breaks are falling onto your shoe? Breaks are basically folds that occur because the leg opening is hitting your shoe too early causing the excess fabric to fold up, and making you looking much shorter because of the illusion of your legs being very thick and wide overall. You need to avoid this at all costs. Similarly, there’s a test for jeans that are too short as well. There will be no breaks at all and some of your ankle will be left exposed. This is not to be confused with jeans stitched short as trending, which can actually look very good. Jeans that are a size too small however, are a different story and can’t be pulled off as the trend we just illustrated because it won’t only be short legs, it’ll also be very small pockets and bad fitting.</p> <p>So what is the way of the denim?</p> <p>Simple.</p> <p>Minimum breaks.</p> <p>You want no more than one to two breaks in your jeans if you want a nice and tapered, lean look. The right length will also make your legs look longer since they will look fairly thin. Couple this with a dark wash and you have yourself two amazing ingredients already!</p> <h2>The quads</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-old-2286-5-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Have you ever seen someone struggling to slide their phone out of their pocket while sitting down? Or have you ever seen their jeans bursting at the leg seams when seated? Not only can this be painful but also be harmful to your circulation, and not to mention there’s no exchange of fresh oxygen between your skin and the outside environment since it’s so suffocated. This can lead to constant rubbing of the skin which can give you nasty rashes and even pimples if not addressed timely. However, there also exists the jeans that is just too loose on your quads and thighs altogether. Though you wouldn’t be wrong in saying loose is better than tight in this case, if your jeans are too loose, not only will you always need a belt to keep them up, but you’ll also look shorter and stubbier, as we’ve already discussed.</p> <p>So, what’s the best fit?</p> <p>You want to hold and pinch the side of your jeans’ thighs while trying them on and go for the pair if you can hold less than an inch. Too less or too close to an inch is acceptable, but that’s treading into too tight or too loose territory. You want to find a middle. If, however, your jeans fit perfectly elsewhere and are just a little above an inch in your fingers, and you really don’t want to go for another pair just because of this, have them tapered from your tailor. Just make sure they know what they’re doing</p> <h2>The ankle</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-old-2286-6-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Ever fall to the ground struggling to get your pants off your calves and ankles? Ever had a private edition Wrestlemania before bed just because those pesky ankles won’t come off? This is the best example you can get which shows you’ve picked the wrong ankle size. However, let’s say calves and ankles aren’t an issue, and you don’t even waste a second sliding your thigh out of the leg hole at the bottom? That’s reason enough to panic too. You see, your jeans not only dress your shirt up or down, but also compliment your footwear! Some gentlemen prefer tight-ankled jeans because they can tuck the leg neatly into big boots. Others like it super loose so they can chill and just walk around with a casual pair of sneakers at the feet. Both of these situations can be remedied.</p> <p>Consider this – if your ankle isn’t fitting properly, chances are, you’ve picked the wrong sized jeans to begin with. They could be too short or too long, as we’ve just seen, or they could even be too tight or too loose altogether. You would know this since there is no such thing as picking an ankle size along with the waist and length – it’s always a given! So take your pick wisely and go for something a little narrow, but not as narrow as to give your feet a chokehold whenever you try stepping out of them!</p> <h2>Try this on for size</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-old-2286-7-jpg.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>By now we’re sure you know how to nail the perfect fit and are all set to buy your next pair of jeans. We’re glad to be of service, but what if there was one bonus tip? Here’s your cookie for making it this far into reading for self-betterment. Try one smaller size the next time you go. You already know what you’re looking for in a pair of jeans now and you won’t be simply sliding out your favorite shade of blue and heading to the counter with a quick mental size check anymore.</p>     <p>You’re going to be trying it on for size and make the most of your time and money while you’re at it. However, if you’re confident these jeans fit comfortably, definitely do try one size smaller. What’s the worst that can happen? Maybe they won’t fit. But what’s the best that can happen? We know by experience, it’s time you learned too! Let us know how it goes!</p>   <i></i>
