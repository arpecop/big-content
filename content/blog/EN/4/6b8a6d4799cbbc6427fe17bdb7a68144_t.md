         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 1<p>Brushing your hair while they’re wet, washing hair every day or not using any heat protectant at all. Are you doing any of these? Or maybe doing all of these all together? You might be destroying your hair and you don’t even know about it. If you’re doing any of these mistakes mentioned below, you need to stop immediately.</p> <p><strong>Tapoos </strong>has gathered 14 of these big hair care mistakes that you repeat on a daily basis. Keep on reading to know what they are so you can stop doing them and make your hair healthy again.</p> <h2>#14 Being rough with your hair</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-911.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Wet hair mean that they’re the most vulnerable at that time. It’s a must to be super gentle when you have wet hair and when you’ve just came out of a shower. Don’t ever, we repeat, don’t ever rub towel roughly on your head just to dry your hair because that’s probably the worst thing you can go to your hair. Rubbing your hair roughly means you are making them frizzy, making split ends and your hair will be breaking a lot more than normal. What you can do is that you can gently pat and squeeze excessive water from your hair with a towel. T-shirt can be used to soak in the water as that material is a lot less abrasive than normal towels.</p> <h2>#13 Using hot tools excessively</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-912.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>We know that the only way to get those perfect mermaid hair waves is by using a curling wand. But if you’re using these hot tools a bit too much, you can say bye bye to every good hairstyle because your hair will basically be screwed. Using hair tools excessively, especially when they’re on the highest settings, can damage your hair on another level. Just try to keep the setting on a low or medium level just so it doesn’t completely ruin your hair. And when using any heat tool, make sure to take several breaks.</p> <h2>#12 Not using hair protectants</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-913.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If you’re not using a hair protectant before using any hot tool, you’re doing so wrong to your hair. It doesn’t matter if you heat style your hair once in a blue moon or do it every time you come out of the shower, using hair protectant is a must for your hair. It protects your hair to a whole new level by creating a barrier all around your hair. Because of this, the heat coming from your blow dryers, straighteners or curling iron, won’t further dehydrate your hair. If you need more benefits of doing so, you should know that heat protectants help you get the perfect healthy and silky finish. I don’t think there’s any excuse left for you to not use hair protectants.</p> <h2>#11 Incorrectly brushing hair</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-914.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>We just told you that wet hair are the most vulnerable. If you think that drying your hair the wrong way is the only way to damage them, you’re wrong. When your hair are wet or damp, they are most likely to break and split. That’s why, the way you brush after hoping out of the shower is very important. So when you want to brush your hair, firstly, don’t go for the paddle or round brush, use a comb with wide tooth to comb your hair and untangle them. There are brushes available which are mainly created for wet hair. Start from the ends and gently comb your way upwards.</p> <h2>#10 Dirty hair styling tools</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-915.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>We’re pretty sure you don’t remember the last time you cleaned your hair brush. Well, it’s time that you go and do it. Just like you can never think of using makeup brushes, that are dirty, on your face, you should also try not to use brushes that are dirty, on your hair. If you want your hair to be perfect and not get oily whenever you brush your hair, then keep them clean and don’t let any stray hair be on your brush because that’s what makes it dirty.</p> <h2>#9 Not getting a regular hair trim</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-916.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If you want healthy looking hair, go to the salon and get a regular trim after every five to seven weeks, depending on what kind of hair you have. Getting your hair trimmed this often might seem illogical when you’re trying to grow your hair a bit longer than before but you should know that this is very necessary. If you miss out on trimming, you might end up getting split ends which probably will travel to rest of your hair strands too. This can make your hair look a lot thinner than before.</p> <h2>#8 Too tight hairdo</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-917.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>When you want to keep your hair off your face, you usually tie your hair into a ponytail or a knot. But when you pull your hair back to do so, you’re not doing anything good to it. Extra tight hairstyles put over pressure on your hair strands and this leads to a high level of hair breakage.</p>     <h2>#7 Using too many hair products</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-918.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Too much of something isn’t a good thing either. If you use a little bit of hair product then it’s really good but when these products are excessively used, they will damage your hair. We know that the perfect hairstyles are made by using hair gel, hair mousse, hair oil etc. but when you use these products all together, you will end up with your hair weighing down and oily/ greasy looking hair.</p> <h2>#6 Over using dry shampoo</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-919.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Do you use dry shampoo every day? Well it’s time that you start a detox of dry shampoo. This product is actually good for your hair but only if you’re using it in a pinch. But if you’re using it a lot just to avoid hair wash, it’s horrible. It’s good that you use dry shampoo after a few washes and it’s also a way to refresh your hair. This also helps you avoid over shampooing. But you have got to make sure that you’re not relying too much on it.</p> <h2>#5 Teasing your hair</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-920.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>We all want volume in our hair but that definitely doesn’t mean that you get it by teasing your hair at your head’s crown or brushing your hair in the opposite direction. Teasing your hair means that you brush your hair in the opposite way so it gets all frizzy and well, it damages your hair on a whole new level. Instead of adopting this way to give volume to your hair, even the mousses and sprays used for giving volume to your hair are better than teasing.</p> <h2>#4 Chemically processing your hair</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-921.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Bleaching, chemically straightening or even coloring is proved to be very stressful for your hair. Well, the bonding between your hairs is broken and it gets itself fixed again just to lock in what so ever change you want. If you still want your hair to be colored or straightened, you can have a talk with your hairstylist and get a gentle way of doing so. You can even do a hair-treatment diet which will be helpful for your problems. But we all know that to fix your damaged hair, the best way is to keep it all natural.</p> <h2>#3 You heat style every other day</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-922.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Di you think you reach out for your hair dryer every single time you come out of the shower? Well if you do, try to take a break from doing so and also using any other heat tools just so your hair can relax. Instead of using a hair dryer when it’s a rainy or humid weather outside, try to soak the extra water from your hair with a towel and let it air dry. You can soon tie your hair in a bun or braid.</p> <h2>#2 Use hot tools on wet hair</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-923.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If you hear your hair sizzling like some food is being cooked in a frying pan, STOP. When you hear such a sound, this means that your hair aren’t properly dried up, or your locks are wet. This will be severely ruining your hair. Never ever use hair tools until your hair aren’t 100% dry. You have to make sure they’re dry first.</p> <h2>#1 Over washing your hair</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-924.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>We know that when we talk about summer, it means sweat and greasy hair after every 5 minutes. But that certainly doesn’t mean that you hop in shower after every 5 minutes. That will be of no benefit because you’ll sweat again very soon but it sure will be destroying your hair. Shampooing too many times means that the necessary oil will be stripped off too and that’s needed to give your hair a natural shine. Try to shampoo after 2-3 days and in between you can use dry shampoo.</p>     <p>We hope these mistakes we’ve pointed out will benefit you in the future.
