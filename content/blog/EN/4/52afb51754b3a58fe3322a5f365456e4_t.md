description: "Apart from the 7 wonders of the world, there exist a lot more things that are jaw dropping. Such is the story of Beth Moon who has recently discovered some of the ancient trees of Earth for our amusement. This article contains all of the medieval trees that exist all around the world but we have never had a chance to see them."

As one grows older and more sensible, he or she automatically feels closer to nature as nothing in the world compares to the joy and solace that is brought to one’s mind as well as his or her soul through closeness to nature.</p> <p>Nature holds such healing powers of pure extents that our mind always feels that it belongs to nature. Obviously, nature is a gift to the mankind from the one who has sent the man to earth and no one can understand the emotional and physical needs of human beings better than our creator.</p> <p>However, in the modern world there are a very few people who have enough time to look deep down into the nature to find the hidden meaning behind everything. Most of the times, it is not like that people do not like to be surrounded by nature or either they love to stick to the gadgets, it is just that they do not have much time to look and think about it. But believe me, once they ever tried to look deep down into the nature, they will never ever find something more comforting and enduring than it.</p> <p>Here, the question arises that if the world is moving so fast and the people are running short and shorter of time, then who are those who find something majestic every other day in nature and bring it before us? Well, the answer to this question can diverge from person to person, but when we asked this from a group of people, out of many answers they all gave, the most common answer of all of them was that no one can be better closer to the nature and can find something new and majestic in it every other day than a “photographer” or what we call as a “paparazzo”, “photojournalist”, “shutterbug” or sometimes as “snapper” too. For some of us, photography is passion and love. It gives the photography addicts tranquility of mind as well.</p> <p>Following the same passion which every nature photographer does, a San Francisco based photographer named Beth Moon has spent the last precious 14 years of her life in searching the world’s oldest and gigantic trees. Beth travelled all across the world and to the world’s remotest and obscurest locations in order to find such tress.</p> <p>It is safe to say that she has explored the most remarkable trees of this world. The trees captured by her are so old and beautifully mysterious that one feels that these trees might hold long buried secrets of the world. Beth has named each of her picture of these magnificently beautiful and huge trees individually too.</p> <h2>AVENUE OF THE BAOBABS</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1473.jpeg"/>themindsjournal <p>Beth Moon has published some of the most amazing photos from her 14 years journey in her incredible book named as “Ancient Trees: Portraits of Time”. Beth wrote this in her artist statement that, “Standing as the earth’s largest and oldest living monuments, I believe these symbolic trees will take on a greater significance, especially at a time when our focus is directed at finding better ways to live with the environment.”</p> <p>Beth Moon told in an interview that she fixed 3 points as judging criteria for a tree before capturing it. First was that the tree must be old. Second was that it must be huge in size. The third was that it must contain some significant history behind it. Some of these trees contain the traces of Islamic and Christian history.</p> <p>Beth further told that before venturing to a certain location, Beth does her investigation discovering the history of the spot. Investigation tools she uses include botanical books, history books, tree registers, newspaper articles, and word of mouth through friends or other travelers she encounters.</p> <h2>THE BUFFLESDRIFT BAOBAB</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1474.jpeg"/>themindsjournal <p>The famous Dr. Jane Good all, while commenting on Beth’s “Portraits of Time” photographs said that, “I want my grandchildren – and theirs – to know the wonder of such trees in life and not only from photographs of things long gone. Beth’s portraits will surely inspire many to help those working to save these magnificent trees.”</p>     <p>It is so significant that we try hard to safeguard the old trees that still stand tall and strong because these are the only living thing that are the remnants of the distant past. It is a very sad fact that many of these trees are in serious danger of devastation, including some of the oldest in existence.</p> <p>If we did not care for them anymore, I fear that we will be unable to find these trees and the history embedded in their roots forever. Actually by not caring for these trees we are doing wrong not only to them but to ourselves too. We are threatening our own existence, as well as the reminiscences of our glorious and magnificent past.</p> <h2><strong><strong>CROFT CASTLE CHESTNUT</strong></strong></h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1475.jpeg"/>themindsjournal <p>Despite their size, another thing that can help you know how old a tree is its rings. We all know that just like humans, trees are also living and as a result of the fact that they are living they also show signs of their ageing.</p> <p>Well, their ageing is not displayed in the forms of their wrinkles or joint pains obviously. But trees have growth rings located within their trunk. You must cut the tree horizontally in order to see the growth rings. The more is the number of these rings, the more is their age. But Beth did not have to cut these trees in order to see their rings, their size was huge enough.</p> <h2><strong><strong>THE BOWTHORPE OAK</strong></strong></h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1476.jpeg"/>themindsjournal <p>Looking at these mind blowing pictures, we cannot but remember Words Worth here who was the lover of natural beauty. As there’s no one but Words Worth who could do justice to the beauty of nature, he has rightly said this in his poem “The World is Too Much with Us” that:</p> <p>The world is too much with us; late and soon,</p> <p>Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;—</p> <p>Little we see in Nature that is ours;</p> <p>We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!</p> <p>This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;</p> <p>The winds that will be howling at all hours,</p> <p>And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;</p> <p>For this, for everything, we are out of tune;</p> <p>It moves us not. Great God! I’d rather be</p> <p>A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;</p> <p>So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,</p> <p>Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;</p> <p>Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;</p> <p>Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.</p> <h2><strong><strong>DESERT ROSE (WADI FA LANG)</strong></strong></h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1477.jpeg"/>themindsjournal <h2><strong><strong>THE YEWS OF WAKEHURST</strong></strong></h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1478.jpeg"/>themindsjournal <p>Seeing at these jaw dropping pictures we come to the conclusion that photography is now not just a hobby anymore. Over the course of years, photography has established itself as a very wide and a profiting profession. Now photography is a proper field of study and the photographers of modern ages now travel all across to capture the events, sights, memories, and sceneries to make it look even more beautiful and memorable.</p>     <p>Nature photography is now a very well established branch or photography and natural photographers try their best ever tricks and talents to capture world’s most beautiful sights and bring to the eyes of people like us who, otherwise, will not ever get a chance to go and see those things from our own eyes. Many of the photographers have also died in attempting an effort to capture the nature’s most dangerous and far off places in the world.</p>   <i></i>
