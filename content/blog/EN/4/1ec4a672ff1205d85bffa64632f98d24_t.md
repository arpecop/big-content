They are so nice; they would apologize to you if you ran over their cat. But, even one of the friendliest nations in the world, Canadians can deliver some pretty savage, sizzling burns to their neighbors of the U.S.A. While they would never even dream of bragging about their envious healthcare system, Robin Sparkles, gun protection laws, flawless international relations with every country in existence and their President McCutie, Justin Trudeau even they can have enough of their troublesome neighbors every now and then. So they deliver the sassiest of burns in the best way they know how!</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-24.gif"/>reddit via giphy <p>Warning: This post may want you to immigrate to Canada and crash their immigration site again and we believe that before you even think of doing that you should know that the University of Victoria offers a course called “The Science of Batman”. They have a course on Batman!!!</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-25.gif"/>via tumblr <h2>22.
