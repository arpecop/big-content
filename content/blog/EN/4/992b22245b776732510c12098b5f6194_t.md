There are several ways to improve your intimacy sessions and with simple tweaks to your diet and lifestyle you can achieve those objectives easily.</p> <p>Apart from certain exercises that enable you to last longer in bed there are even medications which help delay the climax. It could be the other way round and maybe your partner is the one who comes quickly. In that case you need to be supportive of them and move forward as a team with encouragement and open communication.</p> <p>Different methods that you could employ in order to enjoy longer intimate sessions are discussed below.</p> <h2>3. Healthier lifestyle impacts your intimacy positively</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1286.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It is quite understandable that a leaner person not only looks better but also to a large extent builds a lot of self-respect and confidence. If you are always having self-doubt and second guessing your sexual performance it is time to positively reinforce yourself.</p> <p>Try to indulge in self-talk where you address yourself taking your name and reminding yourself that you are capable of doing much better. Just make yourself comfortable with the fact that it is common for people to finish fast and that with time it will improve. This is very important because it will enable you to banish your self-doubt because half the battle is won if you overcome your nerves.</p> <p>Another reason for finishing quickly may be attributed to masturbation to a quick climax. Guys are more susceptible to this habit as compared to girls. However you could start practicing delaying the climax while indulging in masturbation.</p> <p>This will subconsciously train your body to take some time before coming and elongate your intimacy sessions. Another tip is to masturbate a couple of hours before sex as it will make it difficult to climax again so soon.</p> <p>There are also a number of exercises over the YouTube and online which you could do from the comfort of your home without requiring fancy gym equipment. Mostly focusing on the pelvic floor muscles as they are primarily responsible for ejaculation, so particularly men may seek to improve their sexual performance through them. Another common tip is to keep your breathing nice and slow during sex instead of heavy breaths.</p>     <p>Cardio exercises like running or jogging may help. This will take some time and improve with practice but slow and deep breaths have shown to delay the climax.</p> <p>One of the major lifestyle changes you need to make is cutting down on tobacco and alcohol. These have proven to lower your sex drive, cause erectile dysfunction and several other performance related problems.</p> <p>At least avoid them before sex and it would be better if you could minimize their usage entirely .</p> <h2>2. Bringing changes to your sex life</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1287.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>First of all you need to take your partner into confidence and decide how best to tackle this issue. One of the ways is to only focus on your partnerâ€™s stimulation. If your partner is well stimulated and near climax you both will climax roughly on the same time.</p> <p>It is also recommended to take things in a calm, collected manner. Sex is not about satisfying your own needs. That would be incredibly selfish on your part. It is your job to make sure your partner is also satisfied. So maybe spend more time on the foreplay.</p> <p>Trying different sexual positions and techniques is a good idea to elongate your intimacy session. It will be something exciting for the both of you and may infact help you to delay climax. You will also be more aware of those positions which make you come quickly so you could avoid them until later.</p> <p>Another technique is to take breaks in between your intimacy sessions. When one of you is near climax you could halt the sexual activity for 30 seconds and then resume. This will enable you to last long enough to climax with your partner.</p> <p>Another technique is to distract yourself with some thoughts outside of the bedroom. It could be work related or some television show you follow. Anything to take your mind away from the immediate surroundings is good enough.</p> <h2>1. Opting for medications and specialized products</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1288.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>There are thicker condoms available which are primarily designed to make one last longer in bed. Infact there are some variants which even have a numbing agent which temporarily reduce sensitivity down there enabling one to have more time between the sheets.</p> <p>There are special lubricants available which also function as desensitizing agents and may aid you to last longer. Care must be observed when using topical numbing agent as you might end up desensitizing your partner to stimulation. So it is recommended to wear a condom.</p> <p>As a last resort you could opt for prescription medicine to enhance your sexual performance. It would also address the issue of erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation.</p>     <p>At the end of the day sexual intimacy is very important to have that fulfilling experience with your partner. It is always recommended to talk about any issues and try to make it a worthwhile experience for the both of you.</p>   <i></i>
