Be it the dating sites or other social media, the preferred choice is text messages.</p> <p>Sometimes it involves the consent of both the parties involved but often times you come across a creep who just won’t quit even after being clearly told to stop. In such situations a person has a lot of different options to address the situation and also an opportunity to make the online troll pay for their unwanted online advances.</p> <p>Of course one always has the option of simply blocking them with many different apps available for that purpose.</p>     <p>However there is no fun in that. You could always have sly replies and witty ways to make things interesting. Not only will you have a good laugh about it but hopefully drive the message home in an effective manner to make the pervert stop. This woman was persistently being texted in a provocative manner and she was not at all game about it. So she dealt with him in the wittiest manner possible. The following exchange shows how you can always lure them in while playing along and then as soon as things get warmed up you show your true colors. The disappointment will leave them reeling and unable to recover.</p>     <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-115.jpeg"/>Tapoos <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-116.jpeg"/>Tapoos <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-117.jpeg"/>Tapoos <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-118.jpeg"/>Tapoos <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-119.jpeg"/>Tapoos <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-120.jpeg"/>Tapoos <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-121.jpeg"/>Tapoos   <i></i>
