Mike Hughes does not believe in science and has spent a whole lot of time building a homemade rocket at a cost of some 20 thousand dollars. He now wants to fire away.</p>      <p> Things you see in the desert. #rocketman #flatearth #flatearthresearch #amboy #wondervalley #madmikehughes @juanpollotv</p> <p>A post shared by William Hillyard (@williamhillyard) on Nov 25, 2017 at 10:20pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Like many great scientists and engineers Mike Hughes creation has also been born in a garage. The sixty one year has used his own savings to fund his dream machine. He works as a driver and gets paid a bare subsistence wage of 15 dollars an hour. The 20 thousand dollar price tag includes a motorhome which the sixty one year bought online and will be connected to the launch pad.</p>      <p> This is why we do the “overlanding”. Driving through the Mojave, we randomly came across “Mad” Mike who built his own rocket and is planning to launch himself into the sky to prove that the earth is flat! Exploration to the extreme!</p>     <p>A post shared by Bomber Products (@bomberproducts) on Nov 26, 2017 at 6:39pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Mike Hughes or Mad Mike Hughes as he prefers, has also claimed that he is the first human being in the history of planet earth to have single handedly managed to design and build a rocket from scratch and then to launch himself. He is a rocket engineer, inventor and pilot all in one.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1459.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The rocket itself was built using what parts Mr. Hughes could procure and mostly he got them from scrap parts.</p> <p>He is all set to fly on the 25th of November. He hopes to be able to fly at over 500 miles per hour over the town of Amboy, California. Thankfully in case something does go wrong the town only has four people living in it so mass casualties are not expected in case the flight does not go as planned.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1460.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Mr. Hughes admitted that the whole venture was very scary, he added though that it is worth the risk it is not like anybody is immortal anyways so why not. According to Mad Mike Hughes he likes to think of himself as something of a swashbuckling pioneer pushing the boundaries of human achievement with his dare devilish endeavors.</p> <p>His belief against science is almost like a religious conviction. He refuses to believe anything that modern day science might have to say. For instance the sixty one year old still believes that the Earth is flat. In fact Research Flat Earth is something that actually exists and wait there is more they are actually one of his main backers in his quest to launch himself in a dangerously untested and homemade rocket in which he wants to blast off and make history doing it.</p> <p>The growing anti-intellectualism that has been taking hold in the United States over the past several decades is a worrying trend. The election of Donald Trump is among other things a manifestation of the anti-science lobby which will simply not believe anything at all. This does not bode well for the United States position as a world leader in education and the leader of the knowledge economy of the 21st century.</p> <p>The continued refusal to believe science is of course not something that is restricted to the United States alone, although the United States does stand out among developed nations as the in which such people are found to be most numerous and prominent.</p> <p>People claiming that the Earth is flat for instance are a stubborn group who simply refuse to budge even in the face of mounting scientific evidence that their dearly held beliefs regarding the planet being flat are just patently false.</p>     <p>The last Grand Mufti of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for instance insisted that the Earth was flat and had to be told by a member of the royal family that it is indeed round for him to believe it. The Prince was a son of the current King Salman who had actually been to outer space and assured the Kingdom’s senior most cleric that the Earth was indeed round.</p>   <i></i>
