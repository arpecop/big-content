You never know where you might need it in handy.</p> <p>We are made a list of 12 survival hacks that will prove to be very useful. Scroll down and begin your learning.</p> <h2>Number #12</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-461.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>If you have ever tried starting a fire you would know that it is not as easy as it looks. If you ever tried doing a BBQ with friends while camping, we all face the biggest problem – starting the fire. Once the fire has started, the process is easier on from there. Just simply use an egg carton as it catches fire instantly. If you put branches into it, it will act as a cover and will not be exposed to the winds blowing around you. Even if the branches are a little damp, the carton will help it catch fire as it’s cordoned off from all sides and creates and closed space and more heat.</p> <h2>Number # 11</h2> <p><img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-462.jpeg"/></p> <p>Tapoos.com</p> <p>We might not always have drinking water available to us. And if we end up having water that is not filtered – it could lead us to get sick very quickly. It can even give us diseases that are water borne. The easiest way to filter water is to use a water bottle and a piece of our T-shirt. Make a container out of that water bottle, and put the dirty water in one container. Use another container to have place for the filtered water. Dip the cloth in both the containers, each respective end in each container. After an hour you will see that the cloth absorbs the water, filters it and starts to transfer it on the other side. In case you want to be safer than this, you can always boil the water to kill the germs further.</p> <h2>Number # 10</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-463.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>If you plastic or other things are not available, you can use a crayon instead of a candle. Candles burn way quicker than for example a crayon, so using this as a light stick of starting a fire would be a good idea. The crayon is made out of materials that catch fire instantly and if you burn it, it will keep burning for at least half an hour.</p> <h2>Number # 9</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-464.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>There are times that we end up going to places and forget to wear clothes that are warm enough. If we are stuck in a place and do not find fire or any body heat to warm ourselves up with, an easier solution is to find some grass. If we just make bunches of grass and place it inside out jackets, it will start to warm us up. One does not want to end up with hypothermia or getting sick in a critical situation like this.</p>     <h2>Number # 8</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-465.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>We have already told you how to protect yourself from water borne diseases and weather – the third thing you should be most concerned with are the insects. There are mosquitos that carry deadly infections that can easily be transferred to us. Flies can contaminate our food and other type of insects can crawl into our water. So the best way to save yourself from insects is to burn a bunch of herbs. Herbs like mint or thyme can be used to burn – the smell it produces acts like a repellant for these insects. This will not just keep the insects away it will also repel the animals in the forests.</p> <h2>Number # 7</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-466.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Bu in case any insect ends up making it to its destination and biting us – there is always a solution. If an insect bites us, it becomes instantly itchy. To get rid of this itch, just apply toothpaste on the bite and will give you the relief that you are looking for. Toothpastes have menthol in them that act as a cooling agent.</p> <h2>Number # 6</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-467.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>If you are walking or running in the forest, there is a possibility that you will end up hurting yourself. You might get a scratch from the branches on the trees or scrapes from tree barks. These cuts are perfect places for infections to live, and you want to protect yourself from that. If you cover the cuts with a little bit of Chap Stick you will prevent yourself from leaving yourself vulnerable. If the weather around you is cold, you can use this to moisturize your face and save yourself from dehydrating.</p> <h2>Number # 5</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-468.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>If you end up getting seriously injured and the bleeding does not stop, the fastest way to stop it is with a tampon. Cloth and other things are not sterile and can lead to your wound getting infected. Tampons are sterile and tampons are very effective when it comes to stopping heaving bleeding also.</p> <h2>Number # 4</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-469.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>As disgusting as it sounds, condoms can act as great reservoirs to keep water if you don’t have anything else. They are flexible and clean, you can very easily store water in it. Just attach a small tube to the mouth of the condom so it stays stable and doesn’t spill the water. Just put that condom in a cloth sack and it will turn into something like a medieval water bottle. It will also protect your water from a hot temperature.</p> <h2>Number # 3</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-470.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>If you are in an area where it rains a lot and all the braches and twigs around you are damp, just use a pick to light fire. The plastic that makes up a pick is filled with flammable material. Just use a knife and scrape some off on small braches of wood. It will catch fire instantly and help you start a fire even if your wood is not dry.</p> <h2>Number # 2</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-471.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Just take a water bottle, a needle and a leaf – and make your own compass. Compass is the first thing you need when you get lost and you have no landmarks to guide you. Take the pin and rub it on your jeans to create friction before you place it on the leaf. And just place the leaf and needle on the water, the side which you rubbed on your jeans will automatically start pointing towards north.</p> <h2>Number # 1</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-472.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com     <p>If you are not a fan of watching documentaries on Nat Geo – you will not know anything about snakes. Not all snakes are venomous but most of them bite if they feel threatened. If a snake bites you and you are scared to know if it is venomous or not, the simple way to find out is by the pattern of his bite. If the front two teeth have a clear and visible mark then it’s most likely venomous. If the bite looks has two rows of teeth then you are safe.</p>   <i></i>
