The doctor was quite naturally left distraught and disgusted by the earth shattering revelations from the mother of eight.</p> <p>Bulacio was finally arrested from the house of a relative in January of last year. He was staying at a house of one of his relatives in the town of Loreto, Santiago del Estero, Argentina. The rapist father was taken into custody after being on the run for more than six weeks.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1482.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>DNA tests proved beyond any shadow of a doubt that he was indeed the father of all eight of his own daughter’s children.</p>     <p>What happened to the old man’s wife? Well no one really know for certain and there have been contradictory and conflicting reports on the mother. One report cited by an Argentinian media outlet has claimed that the man threw his wife out of the house. She had then left leaving her daughter behind to be ravaged by her father while she is said to have taken three of the couple’ s children to safety.</p> <p>As per local Argentine media the mother died and the couple’s three other children were not returned to their father and instead were taken in by relatives.</p> <p>As disgusting as the incident is it is not the only one of its kind to have come to the surface in recent years. The most famous such case has been that of Austrian rapist who kept his daughter a prisoner in the basement of his house in Austria while he continued to live a normal life with his wife in the house upstairs. The soundproof basement became a dungeon where the disgusting and vile old man managed to father seven children over a period of twenty four years.</p> <p>That case only came to light when one of the children he fathered a girl who 19 back in 2008 became ill and needed to go to the hospital. In the hospital she revealed to the doctors the fact that she had never been outside of the basement of that house in which she was born and the relationship of rape and torture that the old man perpetrated on her mother. The world was shocked to learn that human beings are able to mete out such pure evil to their own children. J</p> <p>osef Fritzl the perverted old sicko has been in prison since 2009. However there is a chance that he might get parole after serving out 15 years of his life sentence. He is also said to believe that he will one day walk free even though his crimes are so abominable. All normal people sincerely pray and hope that such a monster is never allowed to walk free ever again.</p>     <p>In the case of Bulacio we still do not have a verdict as of yet. However his crimes are on the list of most unforgiveable atrocities ever committed by any human being. He should at the very least never be allowed to see the light of day. The death penalty is not allowed in Latin America or even that would not have been enough to punish him for such gruesome crimes against his own flesh and blood.</p>   <i></i>
