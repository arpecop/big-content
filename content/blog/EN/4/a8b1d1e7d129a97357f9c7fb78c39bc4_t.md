Little did the joy last when the unfortunate parents came across the news that their newly-born child was suffering with Down’s syndrome. Not only this, but Murray was affected with Hirschsprung’s disease by birth and had only one heart ventricle in place of two. He was also infected with kidney disorders and fungal diseases.</p>  <p></p>  <p>Posted by ColtonStrong on Thursday, March 9, 2017</p>  <h2>He chose to fight</h2> <p>Despite of all the complexities mentioned above, the brave boy chose to battle for his life. And this made him a hero around the world. He was having all the medical treatment with a smile on his innocent face, which makes his story so stimulating and him an inspiration for all of us. He also had an open-heart surgery in such a young age but it could not contribute much in improving his condition.</p> <p>In his mother’s words, “Then he continued to defy the odds for so long. We are so so very proud of him. His strength was amazing.”</p>  <p></p>   <p>Smiley picture from December!

He was also featured in the video of National Down’s Syndrome Society that was meant for the Down’s syndrome Awareness Month, celebrated in the New York City. He also became a part of the video ‘Meet Colton’, shared by Riley Children’s Hospital. His fans remained in touch with him through a facebook page named as “Colton Warrior”, operated by her mother, Kim Murray.</p>      <p></p>  <p>Posted by ColtonStrong on Wednesday, December 14, 2016</p>  <h2>His Death</h2> <p>On the 16th of December 2017, the tough-minded little soul was finally called upon in the Heavens and got relieved from the painful life of this world. Colton received an emergency breathing tube in the last moments of his life to assist him in staying alive for a little longer. But he passed away in the lap of his incredible mother while battling with many congenital diseases at Riley Children’s Hospital, where he spent most of his life in.</p> <p>It was described by his mother on the Facebook post in these words, “Thank you all so so much for praying for our little boy. Last Christmas morning when he crashed, I asked for a miracle, and I got one”.</p> <p>Colton’s mother also wrote about the reaction of Colton’s elder brother who was shocked and deeply saddened by his death, “I know some of you are worried about big brother Hayden. We didn’t know if he would understand, but as we continue discussing it, he is comprehending well. Telling him was so hard because his eyes filled with tears as he’d ask “why.” Many times, we find him saying that he wishes Colton could be here for Christmas. …and “all the Christmases.” Us too buddy, us too. As for gifts that have been sent to Colton, we are planning on unwrapping them on Christmas day so we can visualize what it’d be like if he were still here to play with the items that were specifically picked out just for him.”</p>  <p></p>  <p>Posted by ColtonStrong on Sunday, December 11, 2016</p>  <h2>Reaction by the World</h2> <p>The social media was flooded with posts of love and consolation for the family on this tragic occasion. The Down’s Syndrome Community also expressed their feelings on the death of their member. It was promoted on twitter by the hashtag ‘#ColtonStrong’ and kept on trending for many days.</p> <p>On Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning, a gathering has been called at the Maryland Community Church for remembering Colton and praying for his soul.</p> <p>His mother expressed her feelings for the worldwide support in the following post, “I can’t even begin to express how heartbroken we are. Many of you have realized that I’ve been avoiding all messages for the time being. I plan on getting to them as I’m feeling better. Although avoiding communication with others right now, I have opened up social media from time to time simply because I’m astounded by the outpouring of love &amp; support. I know Colton was an absolutely amazing boy, but I hadn’t truly realized just how many others saw it too. Thank you for loving our son.” Kim Murray added that his page on Facebook continue to remember him as a warrior.</p> <p>Murray’s family requested his followers to donate generously for the Riley’s Children Foundation to become a ‘hope of life’ for other children like Murray, instead of showering Murray’s grave and their house with flowers.</p>     <p>There are so many hidden lessons for us in the story of this courageous boy. He showed us how to live a life to its best even if it is only of 23 months. Colton exemplifies hope, unconquerable spirit and undefeated strength. He demonstrated the actual way of fighting till the last breathe.</p>   <i></i>
