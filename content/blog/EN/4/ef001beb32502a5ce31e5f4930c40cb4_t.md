         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -7<p>The list of child stars who grew up into gorgeous people is endless. There are even average looking kids who turned pretty (Kylie J.‚Äôs cash injections cough cough). But some of them age terribly unwell and their lousy looks are attributed more commonly top drug abuse rooting from withdrawal depression. But regardless, puberty, plastic surgery and some cases of letting themselves go leads to them being unrecognizable.</p> <p>Perhaps, aging holds itself in the essence of time where kids we seemingly saw just yesterday in their nubile innocence are nor adults chasing the dream of continued successful careers. While it is true that Hollywood‚Äôs bread and butter is focused on Scarlett Johansson-esque pretty women and beefy, strong men, child actors do represent an important contribution to its grossing. Scripts normally include a child actor at the very least to balance out the roles and volatility of the storyline. Immensely important in their induction, and often acting in high grossing and iconic hits, these children would have their few years of fame before disappearing into the throes of an average life (blekh).</p> <p>Some decide to step away from acting straight after while others pursue the forlorn career of acting. It truly depends on how well they were in the public spotlight after their career and how well they looked after themselves after the loss of fame. Building on the aforementioned facts, we have today compiled a list of 15 former child actors who are placidly unrecognizable today. Hands down transformation (non)goals.</p> <h2>Steven Anthony Lawrence</h2>      <p> #fbf my glorious days as a kiddo #heytherekiddo</p> <p>A post shared by Steven Anthony Lawrence (@itsmepopsbeans) on May 13, 2016 at 11:31pm PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> Photoshoot the other day, darn I look good!üòÉ</p> <p>A post shared by Steven Anthony Lawrence (@stevenanthonylawrence) on Jun 30, 2015 at 5:52am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>The first name on the list is a former loved character that most older teens now can probably remember. Steven Anthony Lawrence played Beans in the Disney Channel show Even Stevens and played an esoteric character that was only liked by a particular type of special audience. With a unique bacon obsession that hits home hard for many of us, old boy Steve had us with his commitment to ducs dedicated acting. But his luck didn‚Äôt last long as his looks were unique and ensured a typecast where he found difficulty getting used to Hollywood‚Äôs diverse roles and as a result didn‚Äôt get a chance to progress to other roles. In the December of ‚Äò15, Steve was spotted as a Santa‚Äôs helper in the Sun Valley Shopping Centre in Concord, California; and looked miles away from his former self. With a receding hairline and aging looks he looked in a terrible state despite not even being 30 at the times. The ensuing selfies sent him in a viral spiral but only spread the believe he ended up looking more like Wallace Shawn than the former Bean character he played.</p> <h2>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen</h2>      <p> @ashleyolsen_ üòò</p> <p>A post shared by Mary Kate Olsen (@marykateolsen__) on Mar 9, 2013 at 3:35pm PST</p>   <p></p>      <p> TB</p> <p>A post shared by Mary Kate Olsen (@marykateolsen__) on Jul 2, 2016 at 3:53pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>The star twins acted as early as being tad small babies in the hit show Full house and acted in it through their pre adolescence. So it would not be wrong to say that they were born into stardom straight off the bat. With a successful franchise of tv shows, books and movies, the Olsen twins were the talk of the town and then suddenly they disappeared from the spotlight. Today they seem to be living life to the fullest as they get used to their recent plastic surgeries. No more are they the wide eyed girls who stole our heart and are in fact very different from each other as they manage their makeup brand.</p> <h2>Aaron Carter</h2>      <p> Have you gotten your tickets/VIP yet? #ACWWT #AaronCarter #AaronCarterIsBack #AaronCarterNewLP #Boston #music</p> <p>A post shared by Amanda Castiglione (@aefolger) on Aug 30, 2014 at 4:02pm PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> Stay grizzly</p> <p>A post shared by Aaron Carter (@aaroncarter) on Sep 3, 2017 at 8:23pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Everyone who followed the Backstreet Boys in the late 90‚Äôs and early 2000‚Äôs would know that Aaron Carter was a teenage girl heart throb. His brother Nick was always the pretty guy in the bunch who garnered the heartthrobs but Aaron was a hit in the scene as he appeased to the younger girl fanbase. Even though he piggybacked off of Nick‚Äôs success, Aaron was a hit ad every young girl‚Äôs cup was runneth over. But after his spotlight died, Aaron did not have a peaceful life as he grew all up and is hardly recognizable. With a body that‚Äôs almost all inked over, he resembles more of a skinhead than a former heartthrob and has indulged in many of lifes vices.</p> <h2>Allyson Stoner</h2>      <p> #tomwelling #aboutomwelling #tomwellingmyinspiration #cheaperbythedozen #moviestomwelling #allysonstoner</p> <p>A post shared by tomwellingmyinspiration (@tomwellingmyinspiration) on Apr 12, 2017 at 10:27pm PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> Fully clothed and completely unstoppable because my power runs deeper. ‚úäüèΩ üì∏ @jeskowithit ‚Ä¢ The human body is outrageously beautiful, the figures and curves and edges entrancing. Nakedness and sexuality are natural and wonderful. But relying on the objectification of my body to gain popularity is not the path I feel is my best contribution to moving the needle forward for women in society. Simultaneously, I won't condemn anyone else for their choices and preferences, nor am I ashamed or against sharing those elements of myself artistically and personally. I can only do my best to represent the kind of norm I want to see in the world for future generations. And to me, we already have a surplus of ass cheeks on Instagram. We might as well get some vaginas with high IQs and global vision in there, too. 2017, y'all. Tag your people.</p> <p>A post shared by Alyson Stoner (@alysonstoner) on Sep 19, 2017 at 8:59pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>A childhood sweetheart, Allyson Stoner was iconic in her role on the Suite Life of Zack and Cody and Cheaper by the Dozen. She was further known by her famed work as a child dancer and starred in celebrated songs such as Missy Elliot‚Äôs hits ‚ÄúWork it‚Äù and ‚ÄúGossip Folks‚Äù. While she started out as a tomboy, her figure is more feminine centric now and she boasts an almost unrecognizable petite yet sturdy figure that is pivotal to dancers. She‚Äôs an amazing dancer now and has life all figured it seems but that only compounds her transformation to this stage.</p> <h2>Josh Peck</h2>      <p> I'm not into labels but I am into Bagels. New vlog is live!!! Link in BIO! Like and tag a friend to be next weeks shoutout!! #tbt</p> <p>A post shared by Josh Peck (@shuapeck) on Sep 7, 2017 at 6:45pm PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> Have some damn fun this weekend, will ya?!</p> <p>A post shared by Josh Peck (@shuapeck) on Mar 3, 2017 at 4:11pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Everyone remembers Josh as the stocky character by his name in Drake and Josh where he played 4 seasons till the shows end in 2007. He was always the overweight, low self esteemed and unpopular character to start with but by the shows end, his real body and in show character, both had changed substantially. While he claims that he supports all body types and doesn‚Äôt encourage anything other than motivation and self-belief, his body transformation was goals due to the weight loss and physique he had carved. He now voices Casey Jones in Nickelodeon‚Äôs TMNT but remains one of the most drastic transformation icons to date.</p> <h2>Jonathan Lipnicki</h2>      <p> #TBT @nickjonas and I at his broadway performance of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun.&quot; This pic was taken like three days ago obvi.</p> <p>A post shared by Jonathan Lipnicki (@jonathanlipnicki) on Aug 17, 2017 at 11:08am PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> Really proud of my boy @paulveee for making his dreams come true. He wrote a short, made it, wrote a feature based off of that, and got that feature made. Guess what?, it turned out well and I got to be a part of it. Proud friend, collaborator and roommate!</p> <p>A post shared by Jonathan Lipnicki (@jonathanlipnicki) on Sep 8, 2017 at 2:12am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Jonathan Lipnicki was as the paltry age of just 6 when we starred alongside Tom Cruise and Renee Zellweger in the critically acclaimed film Jerry Maguire where he was in instant hit as a chubby faced cute kid who stole everyone‚Äôs heart. He followed up with successful performances in Stuart Little and several TV shows. Now at the ripe age of 23, Jonathan boasts a ripped physique and looks nothing like his former flabby cheeked self. Actively engrossed in charity and philanthropy work now, Jonathan is right up there as one of the most transforming child celebs there are.</p> <h2>Miko Hughes</h2>      <p> cuteüòç #aaron #aaronbailey #mikohughes #„Éï„É´„Éè„Ç¶„Çπ</p> <p>A post shared by Full House forever üáØüáµ (@buuu.fullhouse.jp) on Oct 24, 2016 at 6:45pm PDT</p>   <p></p>           <p> This pretty much sums up our friendship #poorciara</p> <p>A post shared by Miko Hughes (@woeismiko) on Oct 24, 2015 at 6:22pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>`</p> <p>When only 3, Miko Hughes established himself as a talented kid with his acting in the movie Pet Cemetery based on the adaptation of Stephen King‚Äôs novel. Under the name Gage Creed he delivered a solid performance worthy of mention and seemed such a cute kid and creepy poltergeist at the same time. However, now an adult, the same cute kid now features as a DJ under the moniker DJ Cubed and looks nothing like the homicidal kid of old and all the creepy vibes go straight out the window.</p> <h2>Blake and Dylan Tuomy-Wilhoit</h2>      <p> Compilation of low quality #Snapchat selfies? Dont mind if I do üòâ Give Love, be Love, share Love. I don't care what anyone says- Love is home, Love is purpose, Love is safety, Love is abundance, Love is the answer. Unfortunately, Fear dominates our world today, we can see it in the news, hear it from friends, feel it from loved ones‚Ä¶ Truth is, there is ALWAYS equal parts love to fear.. Humans just arent good at Love yet. We are new to Love being a primary mode of existence- We grew from Fear, and have absolutely Mastered it. Through time, we have conquered cultures, controlled nations, domesticated animals, 'broke' horses‚Ä¶ We are so good at Fear that we default to it. It is easy to break a horse, we have the system down, the method. Well there is a method to Love too. Dont break the horse- earn it's trust, cultivate safety, nurture it's weaknesses, and build Love- It may take more time and effort, but one day that horse will trust you, that horse will respect you, and that horse will Love you‚Ä¶ Now go ride off into the sunset.. And stuffüòú Who will take the hardest job and be a part of the pioneers of today to lay out the method for Love for everyone after them? I pledge to be one of those people. One Love ‚úå</p> <p>A post shared by Dylan Clark Tuomy-Wilhoit (@dcchillinn) on Aug 10, 2017 at 7:44pm PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> Because I never smile in selfies. #justsmile</p> <p>A post shared by Blake Tuomy-Wilhoit (@zerowbe) on Sep 26, 2017 at 1:40pm PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> The Katsopolis family ‚ù§Ô∏è @johnstamos @loriloughlin @zerowbe @dcchillinn</p> <p>A post shared by üíïüíïFull House Fan Foreverüíïüíï (@afullhouseoflove) on Dec 1, 2016 at 10:25am PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Who doesn‚Äôt remember the other pair of iconic twins, Blake and Dylan , who also played the sons to Uncle Jesse and Aunt Becky on the popular show Full House. To start off with, the brothers are 24 now (makes you feel older, doesn‚Äôt it?) and both dropped out of the acting career right after Full House. Dylan Later became a foley sound artist for the critically acclaimed Game of Thrones. Blake however became even more of a chick magnet with his job as a firefighter. They both are set to appear in the new show Fuller House and you will just get to see how much the twins have changed and if they still connect with you.</p> <h2>Jerry O‚Äô Connell</h2>      <p> Wurk. #Carter</p> <p>A post shared by Jerry O'Connell (@mrjerryoc) on Sep 15, 2017 at 11:49am PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> Guys, North Bay ON is really funny. #Carter</p> <p>A post shared by Jerry O'Connell (@mrjerryoc) on Sep 4, 2017 at 4:40pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>This child celeb was a misfit, obese kit from Stand by me and oh boy did Jerry grow into a hunk. He was already on the journey away from adolescent baby rolls by the time he was casted in My Secret Identity and a few acting roles (and scandalous affairs) later, he settled down with Rebecca Romjin. But it didn‚Äôt stop there; Jerry got on the cover of American Fitness in 2006 and evolved from a kid who ate all the time, to someone who could not even relate to Vern anymore. Bummer, isn‚Äôt it?</p> <h2>Larisa Oleynik</h2>      <p> ÎÇ¥Í∞Ä ÎÑê ÏÇ¨ÎûëÌï† Ïàò ÏóÜÎäî 10Í∞ÄÏßÄ Ïù¥Ïú† #ÎÇ¥Í∞ÄÎÑêÏÇ¨ÎûëÌï†ÏàòÏóÜÎäî10Í∞ÄÏßÄÏù¥Ïú† #canttakemyeyesoffyou #10thingsihateaboutyou #movie #like #ÏôìÏ±† #juliastiles #heathledger #josephgordonlevitt #larisaoleynik . . . .

She was what people considered a teen idol, having made appearances at big hits like 10 Things I Hate About You. Well, you won‚Äôt recognize the formed teen idol now that she has chopped off her hair in favor of an exciting pixie cut!</p> <h2>Jason Zimbler</h2>      <p> Happy 40th birthday to child actor Jason Zimbler , best known for his role as Ferguson Darling, Clarissa's troublesome little brother on the Nickelodeon sitcom Clarissa Explains It All. Who remembers that episode where he he told Clarissa that he was going to go see &quot;Cowboys and Aliens&quot;? I noticed that back in 2011 (around the time the movie came out) on the &quot;90s Are All That&quot; program block and thought that was some eerie shit. Anyways, many wishes to this guy. #jasonzimbler #funnyactors #clarissaexplainsitall</p> <p>A post shared by (pronounced as &quot;dye ren&quot;) (@dyron_rises) on Jul 27, 2017 at 5:58pm PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p> #MitchellKriegman (creator) and #JasonZimbler (Ferguson!) discuss #ClarissaExplainsItAll at @videologybarandcinema!</p> <p>A post shared by Tara (@taragi) on Nov 13, 2015 at 5:05pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Jason Zimbler is best known for his portrayal of Ferguson in ‚ÄúClarissa Explains It All‚Äù. His red hair were probably his most discernible feature, which is why once they were gone, he was barely recognizable. Let‚Äôs just say that it comes as no surprise when you realize that Jason has been out of acting work ever since he lost his hair. Stark transformation indeed.</p> <p>¬†</p> <h2>Anna Chlumsky</h2>      <p> üë´üå≥üö≤üêù</p> <p>A post shared by Andy Brown (@abeezer9) on Oct 4, 2017 at 8:12am PDT</p>   <p></p>      <p>A post shared by Anna Chlumsky (@annachlumskyoficial) on Dec 9, 2013 at 6:33pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>The wee lass that stole many hearts when as she starred opposite Macaulay Culkin in My Girl where she was just 11 but had the impact of an adult star. However, she disappeared from the movie scene to pursue her education at the University of Chicago and made her very successful comeback years later in the HBO show Veep. She is now a gorgeous brunette and nailing life as a once-upon a time child prodigy.</p> <h2>Haley Joel Osment</h2>      <p> Getting used to the cantina on #Oasis ‚Äì only a few more days to vote for #AmazonPilots !

With his stint as the main character in the Sixth Sense (which was an undeniable cult classic), he shot to stardom that was unparalleled and had all the makings of a great actor. But fast forward a few years and this dude is stalling at video game voiceovers and what not. And with that hair-do, who blames him?</p>   <i></i>
