We all love our pets and as the video shows the cat eagerly awaited the arrival of its owner. It shows that even though cats get bad publicity for being more selfish creatures than dogs they are not altogether devoid of emotion and love for their owners. Even though cats do not really love us the way that dogs love us. This cat has just melted our hearts with the deep affection that the cat has shown for its owner.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1652.jpeg"/>Wikipedia <p>It only adds to the evidence that cats do indeed love their owners. Even though they may be biologically wired to be less loving than dogs it just goes to show that they are not the cold, calculating and selfish creatures that they are often made out to be. Cats are capable of loving their owners and should be loved just like we love our other pets such as dogs.</p> <p>Thus if you are a dog person just because you think cats are cold and heartless creatures rest assured they do love you but just not as much as a dog would.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1653.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>Science has also proven that cats do love their owners. However their love is only a fraction of the love shown by man’s best friend.</p> <p>Last year a scientific study into the matter was conducted and it was discovered that when a dog plays with its owner the level of love of oxytocin in the blood goes up by a staggering 57.2 percent. In cats you might ask? It is only a miserly 12 percent. For many the fact that cats love their owners at all is surprise.</p>          <p> #catsanddogs #kittenlove</p> <p>A post shared by Mira Ekholm-Martikainen (@kiikoistenloytoelainpalvelu) on Nov 29, 2017 at 3:21am PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Cats have been known to be attached to the houses they live and their environment rather than the owner. This study shows that while they are definitely less loving than man’s best friend they are not entirely cold and have at least some love for the hand that feeds them.</p> <p>“I was really surprised to discover that dogs produced such high levels of oxytocin… the dog level of 57.2 per cent is a very powerful response. It shows these dogs really care about their owners. It was also a nice surprise to discover that cats produce any at all. At least some of the time, cats seem to bond with their owners,” one of those involved with the study went on to say.</p> <p>Humans and dogs both produce oxytocin known as the love chemical for a comparison of how much our dogs really love us that 57.2 percent is staggering. When we meet someone we love like our children or our partners in life the level of oxytocin in the blood shoots up by 50 percent at times even more than that. Thus dogs love us the way we love our closest human relations such as our spouses, children or parents.</p> <p>Cats might be less loving because they are ruthless creatures. In fact cats and dogs have competed for survival and cats have a role to play in the extinction of dozens of dog species. There is no real scientific evidence that anything like this has ever happened the other way around and dogs have never been responsible for the extinction of a cat specie.</p>     <p>Dogs are the descendants of wolves and have been around for at least 40 million years. They might seem to be more violent creatures than cats however they are not very good hunters in comparison. The introduction of cats on the scene was a disaster for dogs and their species were simply decimated.</p>   <i></i>
