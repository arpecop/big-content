         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 1<p> </p> <p>The adulthood is the time when you experience a whole new world. The sweetness in the friends around you converts into flirting. Nowadays, when you are chatting with someone online, there are occasions when you would face situations where someone is trying to flirt with you. At the end it is always a verbal battle to find out who is going to outclass the other. If you are the one flirting, you would aim to be as unanswerable as possible. But if you are the one at the receiving end, you need to come up with something that gives you an edge over the other.</p> <p>How many times do girls face creeps trying to slide into their messages? And how many times do they manage to scare the guy away? As it turns out, some of these conversations have a great amount of humor in them. We have combined some hilarious scenarios in which you can witness a duel between flirty guys and conservative girls. Here are a few of them!</p> <h3>14. Weighing the clouds:</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2156.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>This guy tries to be super-cheesy by comparing this female to a cloud. She in turn comes up with a brilliant response. Not only is it extremely witty, it is statistically correct, too. Talk about ruining the moment. If you don’t want to be a party pooper, avoid this kind of mischief! And also, boys, for the love of everything nice, work on your pick-up line game!</p> <h3>13. The depressed one:</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2157.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Ever came across (usually they are the ones who come across you) someone who tries to win over your sympathy by telling their own heartbreak stories? This is a classic example. The guy tries to invoke the girl’s emotional side by rhetorically asking her what could be worse than a broken heart.</p> <p>The response is just hilarious. She does have a point though; if you ever stepped on a dog’s tail, people would (correctly) mistake you for a spawn of Satan. However, all of us should acknowledge the fact that dogs are pure and made out of all the good in this world. Therefore, stepping on one’s tail would definitely be bad, and worse would be not trying to explain that it was an accident. This response must definitely have had the guy shocked.</p> <h3>12. Telling her about your shopping:</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2158.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>While all of us find this particular case especially funny, we must admit that it is a tragedy that should befall no one. Asking your friend whether they like a car of a certain color, and then associating that color with the comparatively tiny gift they bought them is just downright cruel. We personally believe this one is straight out of Satan’s book.</p> <p>Pretty solid and pretty cruel, to be frank. It brings your emotions to the sky, shortly before making them plunge to a sudden death.</p> <h3>11. The marital problems:</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2159.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>If you are married, you have high chances of having a flirty wife. More often than not, your wife will be ready to flirt with you. Buy her a necklace, and she starts flirting; go on a long drive with her, and she starts flirting; buy her a movie, she cannot flirt, how? Here’s how.</p> <p>The taunt is absolutely on point, though. Women do take ages to get ready. It is a universally proven fact and anyone who denies it must well be living under a rock. We wonder who slept on the couch that night.</p> <h3>10. Changing the direction:</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2160.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>All of a sudden, your cheesy friend texts you to have a good long conversion regarding the status of relationship that both you have in between. Neutralizing this mental torture is not too difficult either.</p> <p>On the other hand, there are some people who just cannot have serious conversations, especially in pressurizing situations such as this one. They usually take the help of their closest and equally evil best friend in order to manufacture the perfect response. This example is also a classic one of a person going absolutely blank in such a confrontation.</p> <h3>9. The unimportant importance:</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2161.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Texting someone and telling them about how important they are to you, this makes them feel special. But what if you bamboozle them subsequently? Here is an example of doing what I’m saying:</p> <p>Also, the person typing the messages here is apparently a firm believer of the fact that you don’t need to know trivial details about someone to fall in love with them. Oh you know details such as their name, etc. Or, it could be a guy who uses the same line on so many girls that he’s starting to forget their names.</p> <p>It certainly can’t be that. Can it? What are the odds?</p> <h3>8. Sweethurt:</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2162.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Complimenting your crush on her sweetness and simultaneously letting her know that she broke your heart. These two ingredients are enough to make the best flirty text of all time.</p>     <p>It is good to remind your crush of what she did to you from time to time. This guy certainly thought so.</p> <h3>7. A simple “NO”:</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2163.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>You are enjoying your time, and your ex texts you to talk to her or meet her somewhere. Ignoring her text will neither satisfy your ego, nor will it stop her from texting you. A “no” is perfect answer. It will increase your self-esteem and will let her know that you are not interested.</p> <p>A simple ‘no’ works so many times. You can use it in so many situations. And, the results of it are brilliant. You’d be surprised. For one, it comes out so cold that it leaves the other person frozen, disabling them from even thinking of a response. It surely is the way to go in this kind of a case.</p> <h3>6. A hopeless romatic:</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2164.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>This here is a perfect example of a hopeless romantic. The guy tries to sweet talk her into a lovey-dovey conversation but she keeps emphasizing the importance of cookies in her life. The guy and his romantic tricks and tweaks don’t mean anything to her. What do hold value in her life, however, are cookies. And who doesn’t love cookies?!</p> <p>Apparently, cookies beat petty things like love and romance any day. Any doubts about that?</p> <h3>5. The bizarre proposal:</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2165.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Do you love someone and want to propose her? Yes, from an anonymous number. Let her know your intentions when she asks you.</p> <p>Not only is it brutally honest, it is also a surefire way of getting blocked. Honesty is not always the best policy, hence proved.</p> <h3>4. A pair of socks:</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2166.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Let your crush know that what she means to you in a light way. You can do this by comparing her with things that are hard to find. For instance, how difficult is it to match a pair of socks? It is one of the most difficult tasks in life.</p> <p>Sometimes, people don’t even bother. They simply wear different socks and head out to work, school, or university. It is really a tedious task, and one that never seems to end.</p> <h3>3. Playing unorthodox</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2167.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Here comes one of the most orthodox ways of telling her that she stole your heart. Tell her that you suspect her or caught her red handed while stealing your heart.</p> <p>This one is kind of confusing, too. It could be that the guy thought that out of curiosity as to what the he has said, the lady might reply. Thankfully those messages haven’t been delivered yet, because we have a feeling that the response would be quite harsh.</p> <h3>2. The straightforward rejection</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2168.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Is he continuously irritating you and repeating the same old messages over and over again. You can reply him by telling him to stop flirting with you.</p> <p>This one does seem out of ‘The Fault in Our Stars.’ It somehow seemed cute and romantic in the book but just sounds downright pathetic in real life. To all men, please refrain from this one. It’s stupid and over used; almost beaten to death.</p> <h3>1. Giving them what they want.</h3> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2169.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>What’s better than making a pervert embarrassed? A pervert messages you and tells you to undress; a straight rejection cannot make him feel embarrassed. A slight innovation would do the trick.</p> <p>If a guy asks for a picture without clothes, you are tied up. You have to do as he says. This is exactly what the lady here did. For some reason, we have a feeling he won’t be content.</p> <p>The flirting is so common nowadays that the individuals should know methods to tackle and nullify the flirty messages that they receive. The flirty messages are usually offensive but one must not feel embarrassed by what they face. Make others embarrassed of what they did. The abovementioned points are hilarious but provide a sound base for learning the techniques of handling the inappropriateness of situations.</p> <p>Sometime humor serves as the best response to the most critical conditions that emerge out of nowhere. The best that we can do is to feel comfortable, be positive, find funny side of things and negotiating the uncomfortable states.</p> <p>Note: The above posted screenshots are fake and for learning purpose.
