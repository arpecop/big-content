Good luck!</p> <h2>Riddle 1: Two Pills</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-604.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>A serial killer kidnaps his victims and makes them take one of 2 pills. One pill is fatally poisonous and the other pill is harmless. Whichever pill the victim chose, the serial killer would choose the other. The victim chooses his pill, swallows it with water, and dies. This happens each time, without fail. How did the serial killer always get the harmless pill?</p>     <h2>Riddle 2: Murder on a Deserted Island</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-605.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>5 people were on their way to a paragliding event together. They planned to return in an hour’s time. But they lost their way and somehow ended up in a deserted island, where no man had ever set foot in before. Their car breaks down there and they realize that they could very well be stuck in the island for a few days. They decide to split up in search of help and food. A few hours later, they all return to the original spot except for Bob. Henry decides to investigate and gathers alibis from the others.</p> <p>Henry says, “I stayed in the same spot. I was gathering oranges for food.” Nelson says, “I was near the river. I was catching fish for food.” John says, “I was in the woods. I was gathering wood for the bonfire.” And, lastly, Martin says, “I was at a dead end, phoning my dad for help.” Out of the four of them, who is lying?</p> <h2>Riddle 3: Who killed little Ben?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-607.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>A family of three live in a mansion. One Sunday afternoon, the husband and wife leave their son Ben at home and go out for lunch. When they return in the evening, to their horror, they find their son lying dead in the middle of the living room. The only other people in the mansion at the time were the maid, the babysitter and the cook. The police interrogate them.</p> <p>The maid says that she was cleaning the bathroom. The babysitter says that she was ironing Ben’s uniform for school the following day. The cook says that he had dropped raw eggs by mistake and was cleaning the floor with a broom. Who is lying? Who killed little Ben?</p> <h2>Answers</h2> <p>Answer for Riddle 1: Both the pills were harmless. The real poison was in the water that the victim drank.</p> <p>Answer for Riddle 2: It’s Martin and Nelson. Nelson couldn’t have possibly fished because he did not have a fishing rod with him. They had been heading to a paragliding event, not a fishing event. Nelson lied about phoning his father as he could not have gotten any network in the deserted island to make the call.</p>     <p>Answer for Riddle 3: It’s the cook. Raw eggs are wet and must be cleaned with a mop, not a broom. He must have boiled the eggs instead and taken them to Ben. And when he killed him, he must have dropped the eggs by mistake. He lied about the eggs being raw when they fell but could not lie about using the broom.</p>   <i></i>
