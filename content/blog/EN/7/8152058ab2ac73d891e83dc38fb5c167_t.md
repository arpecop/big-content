Castine #coraliejouhier #letricycle #howtobeparisian #vegetarian #urbanbushbabes</p> <p>A post shared by  Girl Game Changer‚Ñ¢ (@girlgamechanger) on Sep 13, 2017 at 8:58am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>The world is hurtling forward at an immense pace. We‚Äôve got diversity, opportunity, and creativity all bursting to be shown to appreciating minds. Unfortunately, some people are still trying to limit the definitions of beauty. They may even go so far as to bully women who don‚Äôt conform to this physical and shallow standard.</p> <p>However, we have some amazing women who came out on top in spite of what everyone said about their looks. Read on for the stories of some of them. We hope to be reading a lot more about such individuals in the future:</p> <h2>10. Ilka Br√ºhl</h2>      <p> I'm not that kind of person who is so excited about New Year's Eve. I think we should be thankful for our life every day and you can make resolutions whenever you want. But on the other hand I think it is a good reminder. 2016 was very positive because I finally have cats again. But it was a very crazy year and and not everything was good. So I'm really looking forward to 2017. Now it's time to thank you for your wonderful support. This year I shared some facts with you and you really helped me with your support. I'm always speechless when a stranger makes some time for me to comment something lovely. Talking of this I note every nice comment in a little notebook to look back at some days when I'm down. I wish you only the best for 2017! üëçüéÜüéä #bestnine2016</p> <p>A post shared by  Ilka Br√ºhl (@ilkamiilka) on Dec 31, 2016 at 12:13am PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Ilka Br√ºhl has been living with ectodermal dysplasia since the day she was born. This is a very rare condition which is actually comprised of several different disorders. The most noticeable symptoms of ED are cracked skin, disfigured fingers and toes, and uneven skin tone. In addition to this, many ED patients also need wigs to cover their irregular or nonexistent hair growth. There are several other physical symptoms, many of which Bruhl is suffering from.</p> <p>However, this woman did not let her condition sap her self confidence. In fact, she freely shares her pictures on Instagram and is on a mission to make every woman feel beautiful. We can‚Äôt help but commend her for this brave and selfless spirit.</p> <h2>9. Sophia Hadjipanteli</h2>      <p>A post shared by Sophia Hadjipanteli (@sophiahadjipanteli) on Dec 14, 2017 at 12:05pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Sophia Hadjipanteli is a model who hails from Cyprus. She has one very striking facial feature which makes her different from the traditional mold. While many women would spend a lot of time and money plucking their eyebrows, she carries her unibrow with pride.</p> <p>In fact, her eyebrows seem to be untouched for the most part. We‚Äôre sure many women would want to be as brave as her. Let‚Äôs face it, eyebrow plucking, threading, or even waxing is quite painful. It‚Äôs quite refreshing to see a woman go against the usual standard of beauty and become a model in spite of them.</p> <p>Her confidence has really worked out for her, as she is in high demand within her chosen field. Fashion designers regularly seek her out for her unique looks and confidence.</p> <h2>8. Swantje Paulina</h2>      <p> ‚ú®</p> <p>A post shared by  üåô Swantje Paulina (@swalina) on Nov 20, 2017 at 11:31am PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Girls who are prone to freckle may usually be found running away from the sun. They may also be seen trying out several creams and remedies which promise to make freckles fade away. If all else fails. They look for a foundation makeup with excellent coverage to hide their golden-brown spots.</p> <p>However Swantje Paulina would never fall prey to such societal burdens. She is immensely happy with what nature has provided her. Her over 200,000 followers are likely to agree. Of course, she must hear her share of taunts and questions. However, with women like her, we are hopefully coming to a point where uniqueness is to be valued, not questioned.</p> <h2>7. Dru Presta</h2>      <p> You are more powerful than you know . And they fear the day you discover it. üåπ @barcroft_tv is giving me a voice, to finally share what it's truly like living my life as a little person. My series will soon give you a glimpse of what my daily struggles are and how I CONQUER them. @angelrod_films Much love to you and your eye for natural beauty üôèüèæ‚ô•Ô∏è</p> <p>A post shared by  Dru Presta (@g0lden.bebe) on Jul 25, 2017 at 12:38pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>When we think of the usual shape and size of female models, we think of skinny, tall, willowy body structures. Dru Presta is working successfully to break these conventions, and we must say we‚Äôre impressed.</p> <p>The American model is only 21 years old, and she is unlikely to get any taller than her three feet and four inches. She has faced an immense amount of bullying in her past, which is unfortunately common for anyone who looks different. However, she has obviously defied all odds and went on to realize her dream. Hopefully, her bullies have learnt a lesson and become wiser, better people now.</p> <p>With the success of Dru Presta comes the success of anyone, especially female, who doesn‚Äôt conform to useless beauty limits. If we keep looking at one aspect or definition of beauty, we would miss courageous and beautiful stars like her.</p>     <h2>6. Mikayla Holmgren</h2>      <p> @missmnusa Getting to compete alongside Mikayla will forever be one of my most cherished moments. She continues to inspire me, and I am sincerely grateful to be part of an organization that so eloquently provides a voice to incredible women like her üíï@mikholmgren_inspiring_others #missmnusa missusa</p> <p>A post shared by  Mikayla Holmgren (@mikholmgren_inspiring_others) on Dec 11, 2017 at 4:29pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>When someone is born with Down syndrome, they may find it difficult to adapt to everyday society. However, Mikayla has proven her doubters wrong when she competed in the Miss Minnesota USA pageant. She not only did a great job, but she managed to bag two awards.</p> <p>With Mikayla‚Äôs success, a lot of people should question why they held themselves back. She has surely done what a lot of other folks wouldn‚Äôt have the guts to do, and all while dealing with her own condition. Her achievements would hopefully spur on other people with the same syndrome as well as their loved ones. With her success, she has also proven that Down syndrome should not be an impediment to accomplishing one‚Äôs dreams.</p> <h2>5. Em</h2>      <p> LAUGH!üòÜüòÇü§£ Humanity has unquestionably one really effective weapon -LAUGHTER, against the assault of laughter, nothing can stand. -Mark Twain @juliashoots This was amazing! You know I love you right!ü§ó #vitiligonation #vitiligopride #vitiligolove #vitiligoislife #vitiligoisbeautiful #vitiligomodel #vitiligoworld #vitiligobeauty #vitiligopower #vitiligoqueen #vitiligo #vitiligoem</p> <p>A post shared by  Em (@tru_origin) on Oct 24, 2017 at 11:23am PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>At the moment, Em does not feel quite ready enough to reveal her real name. As she is living with vitiligo in a world with impossible standards of beauty, we can‚Äôt quite blame her. However, she is no less brave than the other entries here, since she freely shares her pictures on Instagram. She also speaks out against the weird and often confusing rules that seem to govern female beauty in the modern world.</p> <p>Her Instagram account is hence full of lessons on how unconventional looks are still beautiful. Her laughing poses are an especial joy to view, and very uplifting for all who follow her.</p> <h2>4. Tabria Majors</h2>      <p> Guys ask me all the time what my type is, so if you really wanna know listen to the new episode of @thethickpodcast (link in bio) ü§ì</p> <p>A post shared by  Tabria Majors (@tabriamajors) on Feb 21, 2017 at 7:32am PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Tabria Majors is a majorly inspiring woman, especially for those of us who are abundantly blessed with curves. She is a model by profession and is on a mission to prove that girls with dimensions like hers are no less than Victoria‚Äôs Secret models.</p> <p>Her Instagram account is a testament to how this gorgeous lady is comfortable in her own skin. Not only does she enjoy posing for all kinds of pictures, but she also shares her sense of humor with the world. This is achieved through her witty podcasts that she makes with her close friend. Most of their discussions revolve around just how difficult it can be to be confident and true to oneself within society. They‚Äôre not wrong, but they are definitely moving towards changing all the rules.</p> <h2>3. Lotte Zuidema</h2>      <p> üåªüåª . Sunny picture on this snowy day! ‚ùÑÔ∏è Let‚Äôs go to Hamburg! On stay for a week! Can‚Äôt wait to be there! ‚ô•Ô∏è #mdmanagement #hamburg</p> <p>A post shared by  Lotte Zuidema (@lottezuidema) on Dec 8, 2017 at 5:26am PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Lotte Zuidema hails from the Netherlands. She sports an appearance which is pretty non-conventional. However, she has become a successful model despite her struggles, and is not sight after for her individualistic looks. This just goes to show what can happen when you are confident in your own beauty.</p> <p>In fact, Zuidema is well-loved by several famous and accomplished photographer. Their cameras apparently adore the charisma and beauty that radiate from her face in a most unique fashion. She is also a student of fashion and design in her own right.</p> <h2>2. Aleece Wilson</h2>      <p> TRUST IN HUMAN NATURE IS ACCEPTANCE OF THE GOOD AND BAD OF IT, AND IT IS HARD TO TRUST THOSE WHO DO NOT ADMIT THEIR OWN WEAKNESS Aleece Wilson #trust #humans #acceptance #nature #good #bad #weakness #aleecewilson #nielsholswen</p> <p>A post shared by  Niels Holswen (@nielsholswen) on Nov 30, 2017 at 12:25pm PST</p>   <p></p> <p>Aleece Wilson may have had moments where she doubted herself, but those are hopefully a thing of the past. Indeed, she doesn‚Äôt have any reason to think that she is anything less than strikingly beautiful. She is also someone who has a face full of freckles and now carries them with confidence and pride.</p> <p>Her modeling career is quite enviable, to say the least. She has walked for huge names, including Marc Jacobs, Alexander Wang, Kanye West and Rihanna. She manages to stand out at every show she does, and is living the life many a more conventional model would envy.</p> <h2>1. Coralie Jouhier</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-20-12-3503-1-jpg.jpeg"/>Instagram.com <p>Coralie Jouhier is definitely changing the game for models everywhere. Not only does she have a certain Creolian beauty, but her hair is the talk of the town wherever she goes! Her curls seem to be unmanageable, but she has used it in the most natural and beautiful way possible.</p> <p>She is still in the first stages of her modeling career, and strives to use only natural products in her hair. She has been no stranger to struggle, but her confidence in her skin color and wonderful hair makes the world appreciate her gifts as well.</p>     <p>If someone doesn‚Äôt find the above women beautiful, we sure feel sorry for them. Progress means nothing if we cannot love the uniqueness of another. There is no doubt that these women are an inspirational symbol to every female across the globe. We wish them the very best in their journey.</p>   <i></i>
