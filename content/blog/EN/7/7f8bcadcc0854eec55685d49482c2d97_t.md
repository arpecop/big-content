         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 0<p> </p> <p>As the World has progressed, so has the evolution of the roles humans have been accustomed tofollowing in and out of their households. The most common one being that of a woman and her responsibility to taking care of her house and her family, but evolution has been at work and so have the women. What time does this leave for them to take care of their house and their family? What time do they have for themselves? Is their only purpose to live and serve? Well Leslie Means has the perfect response to that.</p> <h2>Is hiring a Housekeeper a necessity or just plain laziness?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-8.gif"/>continuumissues <h2>How did it start?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-194.jpeg"/>twitter <p>Leslie Means, the mother of three and the co-founder of ‘Her view from home’ recently published several posts that have been shared MORE THAN 24000 TIMES. No doubt by all the ladies nodding their head in affirmation. The news itself wasn’t what had the tongues wagging but the perfectly told, structured and logical reason Leslie provided behind it. It could have been stemmed from plain old frustration or someone else’s comment that might have led Leslie to sigh and write these posts.</p> <p>What Leslie had to say about this:</p> <p>Leslie started by posting a picture of her living room and her caption starting with:</p> <h2>‘Today I paid a stranger to clean my home.’</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-195.jpeg"/>herviewfromhome.com <p>Her post went on to state how hiring a housekeeper wasn’t her way of displaying the wealth they don’t even have, far from it as she states even in their mid-forties she and her husband were still stuck paying for the loans they took in college! How stressful is that? She also stated they had to tighten their budget to accommodate paying a housekeeper. We feel for you Leslie, but you showed everyone it was worth it and for that we applaud you. Shut down the haters before they even rise.</p> <h2>Her reason behind it:</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-196.jpeg"/>herviewfromhome.com <p>Leslie said: ‘Because at night I was too tired to do it. And on the weekend I want to spend more time with the people I love rather than my broom.’</p>     <p>Who wants to spend time with their broom anyway? Imagine coming home from a stressful day at work, knowing there is more to do than ever at home as well. Where does your safe space go? Where does having a break go? Imagine living without any peace of mind, stress clogging all your pores. Where does one get the time of going out with your husband to a dinner or watching television with you children who could really use your love and attention? Where will one get the time for helping those said children to do their homework and making sure they are paying attention in school? Let’s be real, no one wants to come home after a long day of work to cook AND clean. The stress can make you look drained, the eye bags, the weight increase or weight loss, the blood pressure and the migraines. Basically the emotional and physical down fall of your health.</p> <p>Isn’t it important to spend more time with your children especially when they are at an age they especially need the love and guidance of their mother to nurture them into slowly becoming a perfectly functioning adult? If a mother whose trying to earn to raise them in a financially stable environment as well as hiring a housekeeper so that her precious time that could be spent with her children isn’t diverted by other things such as cleaning and doing the laundry, is it really her being lazy? Or her being thoughtful about the little beings she gave birth too and is supposed to prioritize? This is the main topic that needs to be evaluated.</p> <p>Not only are Leslie’s reasons endearing but smart as well. Every woman has a different way of establishing peace and order in their house. Peace for themselves, peace for their husband, and peace for their children. The order of the house making sure that the peace stays well established. If it’s a woman’s job to do all of that no one has a right to judge as to how she goes about it. Leslie’s way to go about it is perfect for a woman who works by the day and wants to spend time with her family by night and on the weekends. This way she doesn’t have to neglect her children and her husband in the favor of her mundane chores. We all know the former is more important than the latter.</p> <h2>Why does it make so much sense?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-9.gif"/>laughinggif.com <p>Leslie isn’t the only business woman who has to juggle being a wife and mother at the same time. There are many other women who needed this validation and this sense of logic to embrace their life and being to know it was alright to need help.</p>     <p>It is simple. The reason Leslie’s post went viral and received so much agreement and support because she did what most women don’t do because of their ‘sacrificing the self’ ways. She ventured into the world of bluntness and let everyone know that even though her children might look at her as some kind of super hero she wasn’t going to keep up a façade for the sake of a façade. Her practical way of handling her house, work and family is something other women who are facing the same crises can learn from. Women who are afraid of showing they do get tired. Women who are apprehensive of making the wrong choices, this post was meant for these women to realize admitting they can’t do everything at once does not mean they are weak or lazy individuals, it makes them as human as any man or child.</p>   <i></i>
