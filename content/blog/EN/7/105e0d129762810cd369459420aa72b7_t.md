However, the way some animals get trapped and die (or survive) is truly amazing. Some animals and life forms are actually much hardier than we thought.</p> <p>Having animals trapped in ice is more than a wondrous sight. It is also a way for scientists to make some very valuable discoveries. These could very well serve to lead us towards inventions for bettering our lives. Read on below for a more detailed look at some of these icy creatures!</p> <h2>6. The Yuka Mammoth</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1559.jpeg"/>wikipedia <p>Mammoths are probably among the most well-known of extinct mammals. These are much like hairy elephants, beloved to most of us through the animated movie Ice Age. However, few of us may know that the most famous frozen animal is the Yuka Mammoth. In fact, it is also the most valuable of them all.</p> <p>This mammoth was estimated to be more than a whopping 39000 years old! The best part? Its brain is almost intact, which cannot really be said of other mammoth remains. Hence, scientists got to study all the blood vessels and cells in detail.</p> <p>Interestingly, the mammoth’s brain was found to be very similar to that of the elephant we know today. With this sort of information as well as the mammoth DNA, we may just be able to get these majestic animals back in our lives.</p> <h2>5. The Tumat Puppy</h2>  <p>Ancient puppy's brain is 'well preserved'… as dog bares its teeth after 12,400 yearshttps://t.co/jjDlNzk32g pic.twitter.com/O86yqHHGpe</p> <p>— The Siberian Times (@siberian_times) March 16, 2016</p> <p></p> <p>Russia is well-known for its horrific winters. The snow seems to be perpetual there and has been the downfall of many an army. Hence, it’s not surprising that one incident of an animal frozen in ice was found in the village of Tumat. This is located in the Sakha Republic within Russia and is known to be covered with permafrost.</p> <p>This discovery is actually quite recent. In 2015, an extremely rare frozen specimen was found. This was a dog belonging to a long-extinct species. It had been extinct for around twelve thousand years! Yes, that’s how long the dog was frozen, and the state of its body proved it. Plus, this dog was probably young enough to be called a puppy.</p> <p>The real rarity of this discovery lay in the fact that the puppy had an almost perfectly preserved brain. Around seventy to eighty percent of the body was absolutely preserved. It was hence a very easy task for scientists to study this interesting specimen. There is even some hope that with this DNA, the species may be brought back to life.</p> <p>Experts concluded that the Tumat Puppy was related to the Tumat Dog. The latter had been discovered around the same region some years earlier. Both discoveries are very precious in their own way because they are believed to come from an ancient settlement in that area.</p> <p>Hence, studying the dogs’ bodies would give us an indication of the life of these people. More specifically, we can learn what kind of food they ate.</p> <h2>4. Cave Lions</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1560.jpeg"/>yournewswire/TimesofSiberia <p>This discovery was based in another area that is covered with permafrost. Namely, the Yakutia Republic of Siberia. In this region, someone discovered not one, but two Eurasian cave lion cubs. They were probably twins, and sadly very young at the time of their deaths. However, they may not have died from freezing.</p> <p>It is more likely that they died when their den collapsed due to some pressure. Again, this may or may not be due to the weight of a heavy snowfall or the spread of ice. Whichever the case, these two brothers have been preserved as perfectly as can be expected. One of them was crushed; but all in all, their state was impressive considering they were more than 20,000 years old.</p> <p>The Eurasian lions were a powerful and magnificent species. They were among the largest lion ever known to walk the earth. Their shoulder height could even go up to four feet. At this size, they probably fed off horses, wooly mammoths, reindeer, and other large animals. Unfortunately, they went extinct a long time ago due to low food supplies. This could be attributed both to human hunting and the changing climate.</p>     <p>On a happier note, the cave lion cubs are now preserved in permafrost and added to a museum as an exhibit. If they are studied long enough, we may find a way to bring their species back into existence.</p> <h2>3. Fighting Moose</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1561.jpeg"/>independent.co.uk <p>It’s very rare that animals get frozen while actually interacting with each other. However, in the fall, the male moose are more aggressive than usual. It is hence not so much of a surprise that two such animals were found frozen in the act of fighting. They were discovered by some hikers in Alaska in 2016.</p> <p>The two moose were probably so busy I fighting over their territory that they didn’t notice the ice taking over them. It’s either this, or they fell into some ice cold water. Unfortunately, both seemed to have drowned in the water before having it freeze over them. Not quite so lucky for them, but an amazing sight for us! They are now preserved because of their rarity.</p> <h2>2. Foxes</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1562.jpeg"/>AP:ASSOCIATED PRESS <p>The animals may be known for their cunning quickness, but are not so quick when it comes to ice. Foxes are among the most common animals found trapped in ice in the colder regions of the world. Some speculate that this is due to their punching instinct, by which they inadvertently dive into cold water. In the act of fishing, they may then get frozen along with their would-be prey.</p> <p>Most often, foxes are found frozen in places where there has been an unexpected cold wave or snowfall. The most popular example of a frozen fox is probably in Germany. A hunter in Germany only this year found a fox frozen in the Danube River.</p> <p>He proceeded to carve it out of the river and put it right in front of his hotel. The display thereby served as a warning to all who wandered into the cold. We sure get the hint, and we hope everyone else does too. No swimming in winter, that’s for sure.</p> <h2>1. Tardigrade</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1563.jpeg"/>Wikipedia <p>This last entry is perhaps the most different of them all. It wasn’t surprised by ice, nor was it frozen for thousands of years. However, the scientific importance of frozen tardigrade is perhaps greater than all the other discoveries put together.</p> <p>Tardigrade are a kind of seas creatures also known as ‘water bears’. They are very unlike bears in size, though, as they can only grow around one millimeter in size. It can, however, survive in the most extreme of conditions. It does this by shutting down or slowing down its bodily processes when threatened by outside temperature. This allows it to be one of the hardiest creatures on the planet.</p> <p>The tardigrade has helped scientists and researchers to break all records for freezing and preserving living organisms. In 1983, some of these tiny things were taken from Antarctican moss plants and stored in a laboratory. The storage temperature was around twenty degrees below freezing point. This means that the temperature would have been cold enough to kill any other living organism.</p> <p>When thawed a whole thirty years later, the tardigrade showed absolutely no signs of trouble. It actually came back to life, even the egg! In fact, the living animal went on to lay fourteen eggs which all hatched with no problem or abnormalities.</p> <p>With this discovery, scientists are much closer to understanding how we can control the cold. By learning the effect cold can have on living tissue, we may be able to withstand extreme climates in the near future.</p>     <p>There is probably nothing more beautiful or more dangerous than ice. The ways these animals are trapped give us an amazing insight into how ice can preserve things through eons and centuries. If ice continues giving us this sort of precious DNA, extinction as a process could become a thing of the past.</p>   <i></i>
