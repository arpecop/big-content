Even though he asked politely not to put everyone including himself in danger with such reckless behavior he refused to stop. Eventually a gas station took fire extinguisher and took out the potentially dangerous cigarette and in doing so became a hero and managed to single handedly avert a major tragedy,</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1273.jpeg"/>twistedsifter <p>Well let’s face it smoking in a gas station is not just stupid it is downright illegal and nobody in their right mind should take a smoke break in a gas station, it is just common sense but as Voltaire said it more than two hundred years ago common sense is not so common and this man has proven the Frenchman right with his bizarre and extremely dangerous antics.</p> <p>We should all be clear on this that there are laws in place to prevent such rash behavior such as in Virginia</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1275.jpeg"/>gfycat <p><em>46.2-819.4. Smoking in proximity to gas pumps; penalty.</em></p> <p><em>“Any person who smokes or uses an open flame within 20 feet of a pump used to fuel motor vehicles or a fueling tanker being used to deliver gasoline to a gasoline station is guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor if smoking or the use of an open flame is prohibited by a sign at the pump. Any person who causes a fire or explosion as a result of a violation of this section is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.”</em></p>     <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1277.jpeg"/>static.nova <p>Gas stations going up in flames due to a cigarette itself is not technically a realistic prospect because the cigarette burn in such a way so as to minimize any chance of the gasoline catching fire or its vapors in the air all burning up and leading to an explosion. Lighters of course are another thing all together and the danger from an explosion being caused due to a lighter are far greater. If the cigarette comes into direct contact with the gasoline.</p> <p>Stricter laws need to be introduced in order to deal with such reckless behavior. The driver in this case for instance will be going home scot free as the incident occurred in India which does not have any strictly enforced laws in order to deter people from such outrageous behavior.</p> <p>Even right here in the United States such actions are not unknown and despite the fact that the practice of lighting up at the gas station is illegal people still do it. In Stuttgart, Arkansas one such incident did occur when a car and the pump caught fire. The cause is believed to have been related to the cigarette either the lighting up or the burning cigarette itself.</p> <p>The two men who were filling up their car suddenly panicked and not knowing what to do in such a situation they decided to pull the pump out. The fuel was still flowing and it made the situation even worse and the fire spread. Thankfully the entire gas station did not go up in flames and the situation was brought under control in a timely and responsible manner.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1279.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It was yet another dangers posed by lighting up at the pump, doing which we not only put ourselves in danger but also innocent by standers lives are jeopardized by such reckless and illegal behavior.</p>     <p>While the real danger to people is from the open flame authorities and lawmakers have wisely decided to not take a chance with the lives of people who have to fuel up their gas guzzling vehicles on a regular basis, and have thus banned both smoking and the act of lighting up just to make sure.</p>   <i></i>
