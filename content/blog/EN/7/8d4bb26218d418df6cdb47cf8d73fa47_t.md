There was just something about them that was intriguing, but many fashionistas stayed away from them at all costs.</p> <p>They were definitely marketed toward more mature style lovers and just the sight of them caused some people to feel a bit intimated.

When 90’s ended many people thought that it was the last time they ever see off the fitted necklaces. But chokers had other things in mind and they were just way too cute to stay in the distant past. Suddenly they were front and center in every single fashion magazine.</p>     <p>They were spotted on every Hollywood actress neck and everyone realized that they are officially backed in more strong forms.</p>   <i></i>
