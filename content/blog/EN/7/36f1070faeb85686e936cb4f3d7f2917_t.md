If you noticed a little girl in the picture first, then it turns out that you are made up of the following.</p> <p>You’re a charming fellow. You lure people into your charm and engage in deep and meaningful conversations. Your speech is loud and clear and has the ability to make everyone stop and only listen to your voice. You know how to go about things and can do whatever you put your mind to.</p> <p>People give you a lot of attention, to others’ envy. You’re also very creative. You don’t really feel pressure and are not bothered about what others have to say. That’s the way to go!</p> <p>Additionally, you’re also a very mysterious person!</p> <p>What you seem to others, you are really not. Your real self is a much different person and is only displayed to those close to you. You keep your progress and achievements a secret and never let out your thoughts to any random person. Also, your tastes and choices are based on your own beliefs, which not many people know about. Also, your mystery and your charm combine when it comes to people.</p> <p>You have the ability to evoke a sense of curiosity in the people around you and never let yourself open too quickly when in love. Instead, you play it slow and open yourself up bit by bit. To sum it up, you are a mysteriously charming person!</p> <h2>The skull!</h2>      <p> artist #karlkwasny</p> <p>A post shared by bizarreArt (@bizarreart1) on Oct 23, 2016 at 6:18pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Whoops! Seeing a skull first would mean you’re an aggressively hardcore person … but it doesn’t!</p> <p>Seeing the skull depicts something completely different about you. As surprised as we are, noticing the skull first indicates that you are a person with a soft corner in their heart. You’re open to suggestions and advice, and you listen to foreign opinions no matter how much you might disagree with them. It’s surely a great character trait to have.</p> <p>It also shows that you are an understanding person. You easily understand the emotions and feelings of your fellow human beings and are ready to sympathize with them. Being unbiased, you are also a fast learner who adapts quickly to the situation around them. Moreover, you are a sensible person who always takes calculated decisions and treats everyone with kindness.</p> <p>Because of those qualities, you have a huge amount of respect in people’s hearts and they follow you wholeheartedly. Oh, and we almost forgot: you’re charming, too!</p> <h2>The scenery.</h2>      <p> artist #karlkwasny</p>     <p>A post shared by bizarreArt (@bizarreart1) on Oct 23, 2016 at 6:18pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>Noticing the scenery first and foremost also reveals some interesting facts about you.</p> <p>For instance, it shows that you’re a passionate individual. You follow your dreams and try to achieve the goals you have set for yourself. Also, you enjoy your hobbies and embrace them without any second thoughts. Consideration comes naturally to you and you have an amazing habit of helping the people who need it. This is a beautiful character trait as it shows that you have no ego and are always ready to be of help. This is something that is missing in so many people in today’s day and age.</p> <p>You also set the mood around you, with your radiant energy and liveliness. Your vibes are contagious and because of that, you are able to change the tone and mood of everyone around you. Another thing that comes with this is the ability to stand up for the truth. If you noticed the scenery first, it means that you are mentally strong and are not afraid to take a step you think is right. People place their trust in you as they know that you will not wrong them, and this is one of the reasons you have gained a lot of respect in everyone’s hearts.</p> <p>You do whatever you set your mind to and that is why you are a very responsible person. You can always be counted on to do a good job, no matter what it is.</p> <h2>What just happened?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2227-3-jpg.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>Confused? Can’t understand what just happened?</p> <p>That’s okay. Firstly, the way you perceive things can tell a lot about your personality. When looking at a picture, the first thing that you notice can tell a lot about your personality. Confusing, isn’t it? Think of it this way.</p> <p>Your actions and perceptions reflect your thoughts and beliefs. A firm belief on things would make you show a different perceptive, and vice versa. The thing is that everything is linked to our brains, somehow. Every negative or positive thought in our mind brings about some kind of hormonal change. This is actually the driving force behind our ability to see things and how we see them.</p> <p>Clear now?</p> <h2>Can’t relate to anything?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2227-4-jpg.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>That’s fine, too!</p> <p>These psychology tests aren’t always accurate. However, they do reveal something interesting.</p> <p>If you can’t relate to anything above, then that’s okay, too. As you know, not all of us have figured ourselves out, yet. We still haven’t encountered events in our life that would change life itself. And even if we have, it is okay to not be able to relate to this. Everyone is a different person and has a different bunch of traits and habits. That is what makes each one of us so unique.</p> <p>If you cannot yet relate to it, ask your friend to take the test and then, exchange views and answers with each other. Maybe he or she would be able to tell you about yourself in a much more detailed manner.</p> <h2>What’s the point, then?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2227-5-jpg.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>There is a point! If anything, you can learn about yourself.</p> <p>Even if you haven’t been able to relate to these results yet, you can surely look at them and try to predict your beliefs in the future. We as a species develop every day. Changes occur in our minds and bodies which we are not even aware of. Our subconscious develops and leads us to make many decisions in our daily lives. For that reason, you can really use the results of this quiz as a marker for the future.</p> <p>It also teaches you a bit about different perspectives and how to recognize them. Once you do recognize them, you will also learn how to analyze them, which can always be a good thing!</p> <h2>Face yourself …</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2227-6-jpg.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>Know more about yourself from taking such tests. They will make you understand yourself more.</p> <p>They will also help you to recognize your fears. Once you do that, you will be able to encounter them and eventually, overcome them. Regardless of you finding yourself relating or not, if you think there is a change that needs to take place in your personality or your life, go for it. Use this test positively in order to help yourself improve your life and be of benefit to others around you.</p> <h2>The good!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2227-7-jpg.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>The best part about this quiz is that its results are all really positive.</p> <p>No matter what you see first, the girl, skull, or the scenery, you are given positive feedback about your perception. This proves that there is positivity present in everything. One just has to look for it.</p> <p>Moreover, you can also recommend this to the people around you. For instance, your friends and family could try it. It is really simple and barely takes a minute. One of the other good parts is that it tells you a lot about yourself in a very short amount of time. Who’d have thought pictures could be so expressive?</p> <h2>The verdict.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2227-8-jpg.jpeg"/>shutterstock.com <p>The last thing we’d like to say about this psychological test is that it is amazing.</p> <p>Also, it is one of the few tests which only show positive results. There was no negativity in the revelations and displayed that everyone, no matter how they perceive things, has a good side to them. So, this is your opportunity to take whatever good you can from these results, and apply it on yourself. It will surely shape you up into a better human being.</p> <p>To be more vigilant and aware of yourself and the people around you in the future, take more such tests and try to learn something about human nature from them. It will make you a more mature and understanding person. It will also guide you on how to think positively and how to handle circumstances that seem out of control. It will be a learning experience and will give you an insight into psychology and how the human mind works.</p> <p>This is also a better way to assess yourself, as it costs absolutely nothing. On the other hand, if you would go to a psychologist, that would take time and money. We do not disagree with it, it is just that having a shorter and quicker assessment is much better.</p>     <p>Hopefully, this quiz changed your outlook a little bit and helped you progress mentally and emotionally. Now you finally know how different kinds of people think, and most importantly, how YOU think. This can also lead you to change your thinking and improve for the better. If there’s anything you needed, it was a personality assessment. And now that you’ve got exactly that, well, it is time to work on it.</p>   <i></i>
