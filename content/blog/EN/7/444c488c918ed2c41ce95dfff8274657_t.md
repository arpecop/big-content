Hearing a diagnosis is nothing short of feeling like you are hearing a death sentence. However, that does not necessarily have to be true. By learning the basics about major cancers, you can spot signs that can lead you to an early diagnosis, upping your chances of full recovery.</p> <p>Most probably, you are familiar with cervical and ovarian cancer; however, there is another cancer of the female reproductive system that does not get its due attention – vaginal cancer. Why aren’t people talking about it as much? Well, vaginal cancer affects a relatively lower percentage of the female population than other cancers. According to the stats produced by the American Cancer Society, only one in every 1,100 women is affected by vaginal cancer. Moreover, out of these 1,100 women, only 15 percent are less than 40 years old. A majority of vaginal cancer cases are reported in women over the age of 70. However, low rates of occurrence are no reason to educate people about the signs of a disease.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1667.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>In spite of contrary belief, vaginal and cervical cancer are not the same. In cervical cancer, the cervix, a tube that connects the uterus with the vagina gets affected. When cancer cells threaten to infiltrate the actual vaginal canal that is called vaginal cancer. If a woman has cancer cells present in both her cervix and vagina, it will be dubbed as cervical cancer.</p> <p>On the subject of occurrence, doctors don’t really know what causes vaginal cancer. However, causes of vaginal cancer have been linked to HPV and intense exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) while in utero. DES is the name given to a synthetic form of the hormone estrogen that was prescribed to women during the period of 1940 to 1971 to lessen the complications brought on by pregnancy.</p> <p>However, the million dollar question remains – how do you significantly lower your chances of being affected by this disease? Here are a few tips and signs, straight from oncologists and ob-gyns, to keep you safe and free from risk.</p> <h2>There are several types of vaginal cancer</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1668.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <h2>Regular pap smears can save your life</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1669.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>On account of the low occurrence rate, diseases as severe as vaginal cancer should not be on your worry list. However, that in no way implies that you neglect getting checked for it and wait for signs to show themselves. Getting regular pelvic checkups from your ob-gyn is an absolute necessity. Not only can it help detect the signs of cancer early, but it can also save you from a lot of other stealthy diseases and keep your vagina healthy. If your doctor detects any signs of cells that can be potentially cancerous, they will employ the use of a colonoscopy to get a closer look at the suspicious cells inhabiting your vagina. If they remain dubious about the cells, a biopsy can be done to determine if you really do have vaginal cancer. Early stages of this disease can easily be picked up in a basic gynaecological exam. An early diagnosis ups your odds of beating this otherwise deadly disease very significantly.</p> <p>Experts worldwide suggest that for optimum vaginal health, pap smears should be conducted between the ages of 21 and 65 for every three years.</p> <p> </p> <h2>Treatment is relatively easy</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1670.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>In the unfortunate instance that your doctor spots the signs of cancer in your vagina, do not despair. If the signs are spotted at the precancerous stage, your gynaecologist may refer you to an oncologist for a second opinion or might handle your case themselves. Provided that the cancer has not developed yet, treatments include laser surgery or relying on topical medicine to destroy the abnormal tissue. However, if it has developed into full-fledged cancer, common treatments for vaginal cancer include radiation therapy, surgery or chemotherapy, all depending on how far the disease has progressed. Make a note to discuss the route of treatment you take thoroughly with your doctor as some treatments can impact fertility.</p>     <h2>Survival rates differ widely</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1671.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>As in other forms of cancer, the chances of survival and a full recovery depend greatly on the stage your cancer is when it is diagnosed. In the precancerous stages, most patients make a full recovery while on Stage I, the five-year survival rate ranks at around 84 percent. The survival rate falls as the stages increase and at Stage II, it is 75 percent while on Stages III and IV it is a meagre 57 percent. However, survival rates also differ greatly from person to person, and your personal doctor is the only one who can give you an accurate representation of your prognosis and the stats it represents.</p> <p>Most women remain unaware of the signs of impending vaginal cancer. Making sense of common everyday signs and relating them to a bigger problem is the difference between an early diagnosis and a crucially late one. Here are a few signs that cumulatively or alone, should raise the cause for alarm in every woman out there and force her to see a specialist without any delay.</p> <h2>Abnormal Vaginal Bleeding</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1672.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>A vast majority of women that are diagnosed with vaginal, or any other form of reproductive cancer, experience some irregular bleeding making it one of the best giveaways of a lingering disease. If your vagina bleeds at random but regular intervals, it might be a sign of an underlying problem.</p> <p>While other diseases like a severe hormonal imbalance or an infection in the pelvic organs might be causing this untimely bleeding, there is a strong chance that it can be linked to cancer. As the cancer begins spreading throughout your vagina, it creates new pathways via abnormal capillaries that rupture easily and cause bleeding. Such bleeding happens whenever undue pressure is applied in the vaginal area, for instance during a pelvic exam or during intercourse.</p> <h2>Pelvic Pain</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1673.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Pelvic pain is increasingly common amongst women, especially as part of the cramps and aches that accompany a normal menstrual cycle. This makes it harder to link it to any form of cancer. However, if the pain lasts for long bouts of type, occur relatively frequently and not only during your menstrual cycle then it might be a sign of vaginal cancer. If you feel a sudden pain in your pelvic region, go to the doctor immediately to rule out the very possibility of cancer.</p> <h2>Discomfort while Urinating</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1674.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Vaginal cancer can also lead to severe discomfort while urinating. In fact, this is one of the leading symptoms that indicate the presence of this deadly disease. This pain can be anything from a feeling of burning to a feeling of stinging or tightening. All these symptoms show that the cancer has, in fact, spread to the nearby tissue. However, urinary problems can also be linked to other diseases like a UTI or a yeast infection. Therefore, make sure to visit an expert from jumping to any rash conclusions about your health.</p> <h2>Loss of Bladder Control</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1675.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Another symptom that can link urine to cancer is having to take frequent urine breaks. If you keep going to the bathroom even when you have not significantly upped your fluid intake or are experiencing loss of bladder control you might need to head to a doctor. Bladder control is a leading issue in women suffering from vaginal and cervical cancer. It means that the cancer has now spread past the reproductive organs and into the urinary tract. Another common sign is finding blood in your urine.</p> <h2>A Heavier and Longer Menstrual Cycle</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1676.jpeg"/>Shutterstock     <p>Another indication of vaginal cancer is a change in your menstrual cycle, making it heavier and longer than what is normal for your body. For most women, the blood flow is considered heavy if you need to change your sanitary napkin or tampon more often than once every two hours. Any change in your monthly cycle should be noted and talked about thoroughly with your doctor. After all, an early diagnosis might be what saves your life.</p>   <i></i>
