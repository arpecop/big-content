         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -19<p>Charles Robert Darwin was a geologist, biologist and a naturalist. He is mostly known for his works on topics of evolution. He claimed that human beings have evolved from common ancestors. He talked about natural and artificial selection and the mechanism of evolution.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-313.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>He wrote a lot of literature on the topic of evolution and in his book called ‘The Descent of Man’ he wrote about how there were a few body parts that were utterly useless and we didn’t need them.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-314.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>He claimed how some parts of our bodies are so useless that they are just littering the way we look and function. Now that is such an interesting thing to think about –we have made a list of things he thought we shouldn’t have and how we don’t need them. Imagine not having their body parts – how would you feel about it?</p> <h2>1. Body hair</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-315.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>Our body functions in a way that it stops our sweat from coming in the way of our sight. The same way men seem to have more hair on their body than women do. The facial hair serve the purpose of attracting the opposite gender. There is some amount of sexual attracting with men that have beards. As far as other sort of hair is concerned, they are utterly useless.</p> <h2>2. Paranasal sinuses</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-316.jpeg"/>Shutter stock <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-317.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock  <p>The purpose of a sinuses is to make our head light in some ways but honestly other than that – there is no point of it. They are filled with mucus and cause so much trouble to a person, especially in allergy seasons. What for?</p> <h2>3. Extrinsic ear muscles</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-318.jpeg"/>Creative Commons <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-319.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock  <p>We have seen a lot of animals can move their ears on their own. That is the purpose of extrinsic ear muscles and humans also have them. That is why some of our friends seem to entertain us by moving their ears – but it has no use in real life.</p> <h2>4. Wisdom teeth</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-320.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-321.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>Initially humans had to chew on all sorts of plants because they needed a certain calorie count to survive. But in today’s time only five percent of the population have a proper set of full teeth – but they are as useless as it gets. Everyone goes through a painful process to extract them as they always cause problems or we don’t have enough space in our jaw for these teeth.</p> <h2>5. Neck rib</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-322.jpeg"/>Creative commons <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-323.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>These are not as common as body hair or wisdom teeth, but at least one percent of the population has these extra set of ribs. They got left over by reptiles somewhere or the other, they don’t serve any purpose but might lead to causing pain and nerve issues.</p>     <h2>6. Palmaris muscle</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-324.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-325.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock  <p>These muscles are found between the elbows to the wrist area. They are not found in about eleven percent of the humans and are important if you like mountain climbing or practice martial arts. But other than that majority of the race seems to be without it.</p> <h2>7. Male nipples</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-326.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>The reason that men and women both have nipples is because they are developed in the early stages of fetal growth and at that stage the baby has no gender. But as the gender develops, men do not have the ability to lactate any prolactin and cannot produce milk. So at the end of the day, they end up with nipples that serve no purpose.</p> <h2>8. Arrector pili muscles</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-327.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-328.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>You must have seen a cat raise and puff up its skin when it is faced with threat or to make another animal back off. Humans tend to do the same thing, but not in such a circumstance. We experience them in the form of goose bumps but clearly we do not have enough fur on us to show anything off. Defeats its purpose, really!</p> <h2>9. Appendix</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-329.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>This particular muscle is present so a human being can digest more cellulose. But considering that we do not live in a time where we have to survive off plants and we have ample of protein available to us – this tube that connects the large intestine is useless.</p> <h2>10. Thirteenth rib</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-330.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>If we see gorillas and chimpanzees and compare them to human beings – we will find out that they have extra ribs. A normal human being has about twelve ribs but some adults end up having an extra rib. There is no point of that extra rib except making you feel a little special for being different.</p> <h2>11. Toes</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-331.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>There has been research that human beings at one point in time used to balance themselves more from the middle of their feet. But as time passed, the balancing moved towards one side – the one where out toe is. Research claims that the center of our balance is constantly moving towards the inside. Meaning that in we might not need to balance on our toes in the future. How creepy is that?</p> <h2>12. Coccyx</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-332.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>This is also knowns as your tail bone, where your spine ends. It’s so tiny because we no longer need a tail – but if you see mammals, they use tails for balance and communication.</p> <h2>13. Third eye-lid</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-333.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>Ancient birds and mammals used to have a membrane that would protect their eye from things and sweep it clean. Humans now only have a tiny part of it left and it is found in the corner of our eye.</p> <h2>14. Darwin’s Point</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-334.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>There is a tiny piece of skin found on the top of our ear, that’s all we have left of a large ear. It helped human beings catch sounds from further away better. Not much left of it now!</p> <h2>15. Subclavius muscle</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-335.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock     <p>This muscle is present between our shoulders and moves over the collarbone and our first rib. This muscle would be extremely useful if humans were not walking on their feet but their all fours. Some people don’t have this muscle, some even have two or even one.</p>   <i></i>
