         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 1<p>Getting yourself off an addiction is really something to be happy for. Fighting with your inner-self is an uphill battle. Some people might deem it as an easy task, piece of cake. But when you’re not in someone’s boots, you cannot think of the intensity and forming prejudices would be a little not-a-good-thing-to-do. You can disagree with me but that’s how it goes.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-473.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Addiction can form because of over-usage of anything. By hearing this word ‘addiction’, people would think of it as a taboo which really isn’t the case. Addiction can be of drinking coffee, collecting specific things, being a die-hard fan of anything or anyone. This all relates to addiction. The extreme level of usage which can be of anything is what addiction means. Hope it cleared the stereotypes to some extent.</p> <p>Alcohol is widely used in every corner of the globe. It’s quite common in western nations. Because of its wide usage, people in western regions are more prone to developing addiction of alcohol. Alcohol can be quite lethal as per health issues. This issue is quite resurfacing in shape of drunk driving and extreme violence sometimes. It can also take shape of unnatural behavior and being not in senses. But these all behaviors are linked and entangled with high dosage of Alcohol which is of course addiction. It does have benefits as well but that is linked to occasional drinking or usage in small amounts. Some term as a ‘spiritual disease’, I mean utilization of alcohol. They say that by using alcohol, we render ourselves to the inner demons swirling beneath us.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-474.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Refraining yourself from alcoholism carries a plethora of health benefits and you’ll be really surprised to hear them. You might be thinking about the statements which I wrote in the upper paragraphs stating that, ‘small amounts of alcohol can be beneficial’. That actually meant medicines which are composed of alcohol, although small amounts but they consist of it so I hope it clears the contradiction.</p> <p>Now why don’t we talk about some of the benefits? Let’s move on folks.</p> <h2>Physical Health</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-475.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The foremost improvement is that of physical skeletal. Bedrock to our lives is our physical being. If you’re mentally stable and you’re physically bed-ridden, what use of mental health then? You can’t contribute 100% of your stable mental conditioning then. So as we’re aiming towards a better future without alcohol, some of the improvements include greater energy and improved digestion. Then weight loss with less fatigue included, which means you can contribute your energies more in a positive way for longer periods. Clearer skin is also an improvement and with that the risk of having headaches depreciates more and more.</p> <h2>Mental Health</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-476.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>After physical improvements, in hierarchy comes the mental health. The way you think, your critical analysis abilities all are due to mental health. The better your brain works, together with a good physical and mental health you’ll be contributing far enough in making your world a better place to live in. The draconian mental illness have overshadowed the world of today.</p> <p>Multiple cases of suicides, depressions, anxieties and vast amounts of odd mental illnesses have resurfaced just because of invalid consumption of drugs and alcohol mostly. Now refraining you from this menace can cause opposite effects to graver diseases. It entails higher levels of improved memory and mental transparency in understanding things. Things which were once opaque to you would be transparent and easy to understand. Lower risk of developing depression, lower stress levels, increase in your self-esteem and greater productivity in work-life. These all can be attained just because of leaving alcohol and opting a better life for yourself and your surroundings.</p> <h2>Sleeping Pattern</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-477.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Risk of insomnia and irregular sleeping pattern can be quite depleted just because of reducing or eliminating alcohol usage. Nowadays, people face agonizing sleeping pattern which isn’t really a sleeping pattern. I’d prefer to say it’s been awake all night pattern. What’s use of that money and longer periods of work in the office for extra monetary incentives when you can’t get a deep sleep on the weekends or holidays.</p> <p>Deleting the alcohol from the life folder can eventually result in deep sleep with higher energy levels when you wake up. You can easily fall asleep as well. So why to sacrifice your bedtime with worktime as well when you can get both of them the right way.</p> <h2>Attitude</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-478.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>People and society defines what you’re and if you fail in keeping these two terms important, you eventually get a distorted self-esteem which can eventually lead to every-bad-feeling-there-is. So why don’t you go out, meet people with a good attitude and carry a personality which would be long-lasting and attractive. Well yes you can, it just needs some will-power. Will-power is the catalyst to it. You’re the one who is gonna mend ways for a better atmosphere and a blissful future. Feel empathetic towards others and in return you’ll get the same. Stop drinking and start rising!</p> <h2>Saving some bucks</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-479.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Alcohol sure is quite expensive ya know. There are various brands which offer quality drinks according to them. With stellar bottles and packing, you just can’t resist yourself from buying it and that’s what brilliant marketing is. Make the outer shine regardless of what’s inside and you’ll get the masses straight to you. This principle works everywhere in the market dimensions. It all about targeting the right customers. So instead of running after those fancy bottles, do know with this money you can have a nice dinner or picnic with your family. When you can satiate your near and dear ones with the same amount as of the Whiskey Bottle, why go for the latter eh?</p> <h2>Routine</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-480.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Drinking does disturb your life pattern. Your routine which can possibly include a healthy lifestyle and social activities turns into drinking, drinking and drinking. You go to a bar, you drink so much you just pass out.
