I find those flaws make people unique and who they truly are. But, there are some people out there who just love to put everyone down and bully them any chance they get. What’s worst is that most of the bullying happens online and it’s not as easy just turning your laptop off or blocking the hater. Words hurt and can affect our confidence but if these bullies think they can go around and crush people’s spirits, they have another thing coming!</p> <h2>Haters be gone.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image.gif"/>Giphy.com <p>Jacquelin Adan is no stranger to being bullied. Struggling with her weight all her life really took a toll on her self-esteem. She got to her lowest point in life when she weighed more than 500 pounds! But, she finally decided that enough is enough and completely changed her lifestyle. A healthier diet and plenty of exercise did the body some good. And she looks amazing!</p> <h2>Health is wealth.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1.gif"/>Giphy.com <p>The blonde bombshell managed to lose up to 350 pounds and we couldn’t be happier for her. Losing weight at such a rapid speed comes with one downfall. Your skin doesn’t get enough time to shrink down to your new body size and starts to become very loose instead. And, that’s what our girl Jacquelin went through, the more weight she lost, the looser her skin became!</p> <p>The first thing that went through her head is, what are people going to say when they see her loose skin and what if they stare? But, you know what who cares! Jacquelin decided she wasn’t going to let the irrelevant comments of some strangers get in the way of her living her life.</p>     <h2>Strut your stuff.</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-2.gif"/>Giphy.com <p>She put on her bathing suit and headed straight to the hotel pool, where she did encounter some bullies. A couple would not stop staring at her legs and started laughing, and pointing. Jacquelin later posted a totally adorable pic of her in her bathing suit with a caption saying,</p>      <p> When we were on vacation in Mexico a few weeks ago, it was the first time I had worn a bathing suit in a long time, and it had been even longer since I wore a bathing suit without a cover up. I was nervous to take my cover up off and to walk into the pool or walk on the beach. I still felt like that same 500 pound girl…then it happened. A couple sitting by the pool started laughing and pointing at me and making fun of me as soon as I took my cover up off. So what did I do? I took a deep breath, smiled and walked into the pool. That was a huge moment for me. I had changed. I was not the same girl anymore. Yes I still have a lot of loose skin, I may still feel insecure at times, and yes I may still get made fun of. To be honest, yes it bothered me. But I was not going to let people like that affect me anymore! I am not going to let what other people think of me stop me from living my life. They do not know me. They do not know how I have worked my ass off to lose 350 pounds. They do not know how I am recovering from major surgeries. They have no right to sit and point and laugh at me. That's why I smiled. It does not matter what others say or if they try to doubt you or try to bring you down. What matters is how you react to it. How you feel about yourself. Loving yourself just the way you are is hard. Others might not like that. That's ok. I hope you love yourself. Love your body. I hope you keep doing you and just keep smiling! . . . . . #jacquelineadan #jacquelinesjourney #effyourbeautystandards #selfloveclub #selflove #lovemybody #lovemyshape #loveyourself #teamself #extremeweightloss #weightloss #weightlossjourney #weightlosstransformation #weightlossmotivation #beforeandafter #beforeandafterweightloss #wlstories #onaquest #bodybuildingcom #bodypositive #bodyconfidence #bodyposi #transformationfitnation #motivationmonday #mondaymotivation #fitfam #fitspo #bodytransformation #igtransformations #transformationjourney</p> <p>A post shared by Jacqueline⬇️300lbDiet&amp;Exercise (@jacquelineadan44) on Sep 18, 2017 at 5:37pm PDT</p>   <p></p> <p>“It does not matter what others say. That’s ok. Love your body.”</p> <p>Her post quickly gained popularity with more than 30,000 likes and tons of supporting comments in such a short period of time. It’s so great to see strangers coming together to stand up against bullying and body shaming. That will teach the haters to keep it zipped!</p> <p>“When we were on vacation in Mexico a few weeks ago, it was the first time I had worn a bathing suit in a long time, and it had been even longer since I wore a bathing suit without a cover-up.”</p> <p>“I was nervous to take my cover-up off and to walk into the pool or walk on the beach.
