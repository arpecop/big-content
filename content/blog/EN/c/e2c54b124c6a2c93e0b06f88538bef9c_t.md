         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> -1<p>Over the years you must have seen all kinds of things in the sky being caught on camera. From UFOs to mysterious cloud formations, you’ve seen it all. There were always mixed opinions regarding these sightings. People claimed that most of the time there was no sufficient proof of these events, and some even declared that the evidence seemed doctored.</p> <p>The sky can be a very unpredictable piece of nature. It leaves even the ablest of scientists surprised. This article, however, talks about the fairly new happenings that have been witnessed in the sky by the general public. They are quite different from the ordinary stuff and will definitely get you thinking. We personally thought they were quite bedazzling. So, without further ado, let’s see what you make of them!</p> <h2>#1: An angelic sun</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-106.jpeg"/>Imgur <p>This crazy phenomenon was witnessed in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy – the insane disaster that formed on the 22nd of October, 2012. Up until recently, this was one of the rarest and most sought-after mysteries. Not even the best of scientists could come up with a solution.</p> <p>However, a reddit.com user whipped up a really interesting and profound explanation for this incident. He explained that the two bright spots on either side of the sun are called “Sundogs.” There are a few arcs above the sun along with an upside down rainbow. Those are called the “Supralateral” and “Circumzenithal” arcs, and the arc beside those is called the “Heliac” arc.</p> <p>The mystery behind this sight was so huge that even the head of meteoroid environment office at NASA claimed he had never seen anything quite like it. He also said that it was most likely to be an extremely rare event that would happen just once in a decade.</p> <p>Even though it is confirmed that this fascinating event took place as a result of Hurricane Sandy, the real science behind it remains unexplained, to this day.</p> <h2>#2: A sky full of lighters!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-107.jpeg"/>maxsciences.com <p>Norway has been known for its Northern Light phenomena ever since they were first witnessed. This, however, has hardly anything to do with it. The reason behind us mentioning it anyway is that both these incidents involve lights in the sky in the same country!</p> <p>On a cold winter’s eve in 2009, phone lines at the Norwegian meteorology institute went berserk as onlookers witnessed a never-seen-before phenomenon happening right before their very eyes. A turquoise light was seen in the sky and it looked as if it was a pathway to something. The interesting fact is that it remained in the sky for a measly two or three minutes before disappearing and to never be seen again.</p> <p>However, people did see it again and the same things they had said before about it. They said that there was a turquoise light appearing out of a ring in the sky. The sighting sure is fascinating, but it is still an unsolved mystery. Even scientists, meteorologists, and astronomers failed to figure out what it was. The armed forces got involved, too. They thought it was some kind of message from the extra-terrestrial. However, it has never been seen since then.</p> <p>Has anyone got any ideas?</p> <h2>#3: Yet another sky full of lighters!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-108.jpeg"/>theladbible.com <p>On September 8th, 2017, a devastating earthquake hit Mexico. It was the worst that had ever hit that region, reading a monstrous 8.2 on the Richter scale. It destroyed a lot of properties and caused unmatched destruction throughout the whole country. It was so bad that at least eight countries from that region started preparing for a tsunami.</p> <p>However, in the aftermath of this destructive event, people saw what came to be known as ‘Earthquake Lights’ in the sky. The person who recorded them was dumbfounded, and no one can blame him! The mystery behind these lights is still unexplained but there are a few interesting theories. Seismologists, or earthquake experts for the lesser science geeks here, said that these lights could be related to electricity.</p> <p>They claimed that it could be the result of power supplies being impacted by the earthquake and in turn setting off explosions in generators. Now, even though this has happened before, it scared a lot of people. Geologists have a different viewpoint, though. They claim that these lights could actually be “earthquake warning lights” and could actually be useful!</p> <p>The puzzling part is that these lights appeared after the earthquake and not before it. Scary stuff!</p> <h2>#4: Expecto Patronum!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-109.jpeg"/>fraghero.com <p>If you thought dementors only existed in the Harry Potter series, you were wrong! This dementor sighting in Zambia has made everyone lose their minds all over the world.</p> <p>These horrid creatures that are the opposite of all that is happy and jolly, were spotted in Zambia. People had gone insane. Harry Potter fans, on the other hand, were quite excited even though these things are nothing to be glad about. A research revealed that this creature was only just a kite that someone had bought and flew. The image was edited to make it seem like a real Dementor. However, the real mystery still remains unsolved. Do you really think dementors exist?</p> <p>And to think the worries and stressful times of this world weren’t enough here comes more trouble from a fictional world!</p> <h2>#5: The drag-octopus!</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-110.jpeg"/>imgur <p>This insanely scary monster appeared on the news recently. It was captured by Margaret Porter who had found herself in the middle of a storm while she was driving to see her son. Fascinated by the rain, she snapped this image using her iPhone and when it hit the internet, it had everyone surprised.</p> <p>Discovered by her son, it made the national weather service give out a statement claiming that this sight was just the aftermath of a turbulence storm occurring in that region. People still remained unconvinced, however. They believe that the ‘sky monster’ has a spiritual message and a warning for the future of our planet. Quite frightening, we would say. These things may or may not be real, but they sure have a knack for scaring the living daylights out of us!</p> <p>Some even say this was actually the Cthulhu, a fictional character that is the most vivid definition of the word ‘scary’. Not so exciting!</p> <h2>#6: The floating city</h2>  <p>Floating City appeared in China will make you believe in the existence of parallel world.</p> <p>Youtube Link ➡️ https://t.co/53ATCZ5ceo</p>     <p>How far you can go to cover the truth ✨#iartg #asmsg #travel #timetravel #supernatural #blogger #blog #review #movie #vote #poll #artist #scifi pic.twitter.com/T9Pq2nYFuP</p> <p>— Arriah Kiprujistho (@Wishing_for_a_) October 2, 2017</p> <p></p> <p>A floating city of skyscrapers once appeared beyond the horizon in the Chinese city of Yueyang. It really confused the locals and left them dumbfounded. Some said it was a form of mirage, where the light had refracted and made the whole city appear as an image in the distance.</p> <p>However, others said that it was a consequence of a secret project and series of experiments conducted by the USA. Not totally convincing, though it left a huge amount of people shell-shocked. This phenomenon remained in sight for a few minutes, before completely disappearing. Some people also said that it was the portal to another dimension. Some also believed that it was an alien invasion.</p> <h2>#7: More lights in the sky!</h2>  <p>Just saw gigantic #meteor burning over #LosAngeles sky. Was this #UFO #meteor #ET #KimJongUn?? pic.twitter.com/M7s7HhbIzs</p> <p>— Matt Chris Wood (@mattchriswood) September 24, 2017</p> <p></p> <p>Unknown lights in the sky can always make for scary sights. This particular incident, however, left people shocked and bemused.</p> <p>Videos and images emerged of strange lights in the sky in Los Angeles on the 9th of September, 2017. People were really sure that it wasn’t lightning as it wasn’t accompanied by thunder at all. A YouTuber uploaded a video of this event and people were baffled in the comments section. Some said that they had never seen lightning like that ever in their lives. Some suggested that the extra-terrestrial was trying to get in touch with us.</p> <p>Another person said that it was just lightning. He said that the Thunder couldn’t be heard because the lightning had taken place at a distance. It still remains unconfirmed as to what exactly this phenomenon was. Was it lightning? Could it be a UFO? Could it be something scarier? Your guesses are as good as ours.</p> <h2>#8: Skyquakes</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-6-10-2295-09-jpg.jpeg"/>Oddrandomthoughts.com <p>‘Skyquake’ is the name that has been given to loud mysterious sounds coming from the atmosphere. These have been heard all over the world and have been plaguing news channels for quite some time now. Among some of the places they have been are India, United States, Japan, Italy, and Ireland.</p> <p>They are thought to be as loud as cannons or sonic booms and they come from the sky. They’ve been heard as early as 1824 and have given birth to a variety of theories. Some say they come from meteors that enter the earth’s atmosphere, while others say they are simply visits from the extra-terrestrial.</p> <p>Other theories explain that they are gas leaks from the vents in the earth’s surface, volcanic eruptions, military aircraft, and even resonance from the magnetic activity of the earth. Whatever they are, they sure do scare the jeepers out of you!</p> <h2>Unsolved mysteries…</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-111.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>These unsolved mysteries have been around for quite some time, now. For the most part, people believe that these are just doctored images. The more enthusiastic, however, believe that these are real and conduct further researches on them.</p> <p>The reality is that most of these are just natural phenomena made out to be something way more fictional. Most of these have occurred, we can tell you that. But it is not necessary that every time a celestial event happens, may it be very rare, it is the extra-terrestrial trying to contact us. For the most part, for what possible reason would anyone want to get in contact with us humans?!</p> <p>All jokes aside, these incidents are just nature showing us a side of it we have not yet seen. Everything above has found some kind of scientific explanation for it. Another thing that is confirmed is that there are a lot of similar sightings and incidents that have occurred all over the world spanning over a long period of time. Some go reported while some go unnoticed.</p> <p>However, they could also be something quite different from what we take them to be. What that might be, no one really knows for sure.</p> <h2>How are we supposed to react?</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-112.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Many of these incidents leave us with mixed emotions. They invoke fear, confusion, shock, and make us feel a lot of other things. However, the best bet would be to not get scared.</p> <p>As we all know, we are in this with each other. We have our fellow human beings by our side, each one as clueless as the next. So really, there’s no reason to feel lonely, at all! The most we can do is concentrate on our daily lives and understand the fact that when the time to go arrives, we will know. And when that day comes, we will go, regardless of what anyone says.</p> <p>On the other hand, it is always good to be concerned about the world we live in and the future of its very existence. However, it is very difficult not to think about what any possible being would want from our planet. It is also impossible to not think about any other living beings out there in the universe that coexist with us humans. The point remains that no matter what we might think or believe, whatever has to happen will happen, and it will happen at its destined time.</p>     <p>The question is, once it does happen, in what state will it leave us?</p>   <i></i>
