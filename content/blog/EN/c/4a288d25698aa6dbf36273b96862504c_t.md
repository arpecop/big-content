We have busy schedules, with work and study often overlapping as we grow older. Add this to the higher cost of living, and it’s pretty understandable why couples get into regular fights.</p> <p>Social media is also a factor in weakening relationships. With the increased connectivity comes more misunderstandings, such as arguments over liking an ex’s picture. However, some couples still stay strong through it all. Below are some of the habits they usually adopt:</p> <h2>9. A Nightly Call</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-834.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>If one or both of you are at work, it’s only mature not to text each other 24/7. Both persons here should respect the work ethic in an adult relationship and not demand attention then. However, it feels great to come home after a long day of work and getting a text or call from your significant other. Simply checking in on one another during lunch break is also a greatly segmenting habit for any relationship.</p> <p>Hence, even if a strong couple is apart for a few days, they would want to make sure their loved one gets home safely. They may periodically send little gifts such as a dinner delivery if they can’t be there to welcome them home.</p> <h2>8. A Mutual Sense of Humor</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-835.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Laughing together is one of the greatest ways to bond with friends and partners alike. This is actually proven through scientific psychological studies. When we laugh with someone, our brain makes positive associations with that person. We would then connect that individual with the good feelings we had while laughing.</p> <p>Of course, in order to laugh together, the two of you have to find the same thing funny. It won’t work as well if you’re just forcing a laugh because they’re chuckling away. Strong couples would laugh with each other naturally. They would further relive the funny moments with each other and laugh all the more. This only serves to further establish the bond between them.</p> <h2>7. Share Everything</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-836.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>We’re not talking about opening a joint bank account or sharing material possessions. In a strong connection between two people, the sharing of emotions and feelings is more important. Strong couples usually tend to share their innermost fears, childhood memories, and quirks with each other. They feel as if they can and should tell their partner everything about themselves. This serves to not only make them feel closer to each other but also know what to avoid and what to pursue.</p> <p>For instance, if one person knows the other is afraid of clowns, they wouldn’t hire one for their kid’s birthday. This level of care comes from mutual trust and respect for one another. It is hence very beneficial for partners to open themselves up and be vulnerable in front of each other. If both are sincere, this could be the basis of a permanent and deep-rooted relationship.</p> <h2>6. Listening Up</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-837.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Along with talking their feelings out, strong partners also have their listening skills down pat. Speaking openly can only be achieved when the other person is also listening carefully. The latter requires being quiet and respectful, and not using the sensitive information later in an argument.</p> <p>For example, if one party is talking about how they were bullied, the other should not make them regret sharing this information. Even if the couple has a fight, later on, the listener should not taunt the other about not being popular in school.</p> <p>It should also go without saying that there should be complete confidentiality when one person confessed or vents. The stories or feelings they share should not be relayed to friends or family. This is regardless of how close other relationships are to both parties. Even a slip of the tongue can lead to feelings of mistrust and result in a weakening of the relationship.</p>     <h2>5. Staying Truthful</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-838.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Even if someone has done something wrong, they should not be afraid of sharing it with their partner. When one is in a relationship, they need to feel supported by the other person. This also goes for the opinions a person has, as well as their honest thoughts on anything. Pretending to be someone they’re not is definitely not part of a stable and strong connection.</p> <p>For instance, if one is very religious, they should be able to express that in front of their significant other. They should not be sneaking off to pray or meditate. Of course, the other party should also be worthy of that trust and respect their partner’s beliefs.</p> <h2>4. Staying Spontaneous</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-839.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Being in a relationship for a long time could get monotonous after a bit. This is why truly strong pairings don’t let themselves get into a rut. They may have a routine to follow every single day, but they’re not afraid to break it either. If they both feel like watching a movie on a work night, so be it. On a long weekend, they might just bundle into their car and head out on a sudden road trip.</p> <p>When a couple is constantly changing things up it sure does make life a lot more exciting. Of course, having a well-settled life has a lot of advantages. However, the stagnancy can soon get to one after some time. If two people truly love each other, they would usually love having adventures together. They wouldn’t want to suppress their whims but follow them through together.</p> <h2>3. Noticing the Little Things</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-840.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>When it’s meant to be, you would notice every little thing your partner likes or dislikes. The same should go for them. Naturally, it is impossible to completely know someone, so it’s forgivable if one forgets sometimes. However, the point here is that strong relationships have the aspect of full attention towards each other.</p> <p>For example, if one person is feeling down, the other may know just how to get them going again. This could involve taking them out for a walk in the fresh air, getting them flowers, or bringing them some chocolate. They would know what their partner would want at this time through noticing how they reacted in the past.</p> <h2>2. Having Little Jokes</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-841.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>When you’ve been together for some time, there should be a little room for some good-natured teasing. Strong relationships often have one person knowing just how to cheer the other up. If this takes a good old ribbing, there’s no harm in it. One should always remain respectful and stay within boundaries, though.</p> <p>However, those couples who know just how to tease each other would probably stay together for a long time. Plus, they would be able to enjoy being with each other and probably cherish the moments they have.</p> <h2>1. Ability to Stay Apart</h2> <img src="https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-842.jpeg"/>Shutterstock.com <p>Sure, strong couples love being with each other. However, there is such a thing as being too needy or clingy. This could result in a strained and claustrophobic relationship. The most successful pairings would not have this problem, as both individuals would be able to function on their own. They wouldn’t be dependent on each other to entertain them every single night.</p> <p>In order to be in a healthy long-term relationship, it is essential to give each other space. This is exactly what strong coupes do. They may spend several nights together, but are also able to have some me time. They can be happy watching a movie with their own circle of friends as well as with each other.</p> <p>Having one’s own life is actually quite beneficial for sharing a bond with another person. This only increases the attraction and establishes the surety of a long-term bond.</p>     <p>A strong relationship isn’t about just one factor. It is important to be friends and also to fights; just like it is important to have good and bad times together. For a long-term relationship, one needs to stay firm through the ups and downs of life with the other person. Plus, we should actually want to experience it all with them.</p>   <i></i>
