The movie is about how humans have developed a way to go into their subconscious minds and explore their world. Recreate their lives and rediscover their potential according to their whims. In short be the architect of their own dreams. Infact you could even ‘invade’ other individual’s subconscious to embed a thought which will later change the person’s decision-making. It was an interesting concept and one which is not far from reality. Our subconscious does influence our everyday actions. We may not be aware since all our attention is taken by the conscious half of our mind. This is because our bodies tend to react to immediate stimuli which push the subconscious into the background.</p> <p>This in no way means our subconscious is not actively helping us out in our day to day routine. For instance take the driving of a vehicle. A person who is learning to drive and taking the car on the road for the first time will be completely focused on the road ahead. He will not indulge in any other activity unless it involves moving the car. However once the same person becomes comfortable with driving he will indulge in conversation. They might even feel comfortable using their cell phone while driving (although we strongly recommend against that). This ease with which a person eventually drives is due to the subconscious which took those activities required to drive and registered them for future reference. This is how several of our tasks become automated and what we later come to call as habits.</p> <h3></h3>  <h3>Testing your subconscious and determining what thoughts it house</h3> <p>Following are the questions which we need you to answer from your heart:</p> <p>1. You are watching a vast sea in front of you. What do you feel?</p> <p>2. You are walking in a forest and keeping an eye on the ground. What do you see? How do you feel?</p> <p>3. You see seagulls flying high in the sky above your head. What emotions do you feel?</p> <p>4. You are looking at a group of horses running. What do you feel?</p> <p>5. You are stranded in the desert and there is a huge wall in front of you. You can see an oasis through a small hole in the wall. The wall is insurmountable. What would you do?</p> <p>6. While wandering in the desert you suddenly find a jug full of water. What are your reactions going to be?</p> <p>7. You are lost in the forest night and suddenly see a house with lights on. What are you going to do?</p> <p>8. You are in the fog and it is impossible to see anything. What is the first thing that comes to your mind?</p> <p>Now we hope you answered the questions with your natural intuition. However your answer may make sense with the following explanation for each question respectively:</p> <p>1. Your answer to this basically reflects your attitude towards life. It spells out your emotions and your desire in life. The question signifies the vast options we see in front of us and how we handle those opportunities.</p> <p>2. This signifies your relationship with your family. The forest setting could be serene and mind soothing or it could also trigger some feelings of misgivings and uncertainties. So this answer determines in which group you would fall.</p> <p>3. This shows your attitude towards woman. How you treat them and how you see them generally.</p> <p>4. Your attitude towards men. Your feelings and emotions while dealing with men.</p> <p>5. How you strategize in the face of problems. It determined whether you will face your difficult projects or abandon them altogether.</p> <p>6. This is how you choose your sexual partner. The sudden feeling of either joy or suspicion of finding water in the middle of desert means you are completely exhibiting your sincerest thoughts and feel uninhibited by your insecurities. That person is completing you in a way and you see them as highly compatible with you.</p> <p>7. The answer to this shows your readiness for marriage and starting a family. The cottage or home in the middle of forest is the prospect of marrying someone without knowing how it will work out. If you considered yourself to look for someone and just settle down you would choose going up to the house and ask for help. However if you are not yet ready to start a family and still want to live an independent life you will probably answer with going on your journey without investigating the house.</p> <p>8. Shows your attitude towards death. The fog signifies the unpredictable nature of death and something which is imminent and ever present. The zero visibility is the idea that you have no control whatsoever over your unavoidable yet natural demise.</p> <p> </p> <h3>Reconditioning the subconscious</h3> <p>The subconscious is a lot more involved in our daily lives than we may realize. Functions like breathing, heartbeat and the central nervous system all come under the domain of subconscious. It provides you with insights and feedback that completes and conforms to your self-concept. It will take your day to day actions and try to figure a pattern that is consistent with your personality. That is why it is so important for anyone who wishes to achieve ultimate self-awareness to connect with their subconscious.</p> <p>The reason it influences your conscious decision-making is because you have habitually done things in a certain way. Those habits reinforced your subconscious with certain patterns. Since you communicated those habits, beliefs or feelings to your subconscious you alone can modify how you pass the information. There are certain ways and means to ‘control’ the information you are sending to your subconscious. By control we mean deliberating on positive things and filtering out the negatives from a process or experiences of the past. This is the reason why it is often recommended to inculcate self-belief so your subconscious may replace feelings of inadequacy with confidence. At the end of the day it will do what you are feeding into it. Following are some of the ways to reconnect with your subconscious:</p>     <h2>4. Meditation</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-132.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It may sound a bit clichéd but filtering out the external noise and calming yourself down in a Zen-like state may enable you to delve deeper into the realms of subconscious. Since you are no longer surrounded by the distractions you will start to focus more deeply with your inner thoughts. You will be an observer of your own thought process because instead of reacting you simply let your thoughts take their course.</p> <h2>3. Positive reassurances</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-133.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Our subconscious is not rigid and by repeating new habits and thoughts we can eradicate or modify undesirable older habits or thoughts. We can repeat a personal motivational motto to ourselves. We have to be deliberate and consistent in our efforts. By repeating positive things and focusing only on the things which uplift us we will eventually boast of a much higher self-respect. By sowing seeds of your new positive programing you can change your life and reality for the better.</p> <h2>2. Let your creative juices flow</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-134.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Our subconscious does not communicate in some language since that is the domain of your conscious mind. Our subconscious expresses itself through images, artistic impressions, sculpture, poems, literature and music. So in order to be better in tune with your subconscious you need to tap into your creative side. Several people relate to their experience of self-learning and calming effect such creative hobbies induce on their person. They might not have been able to reach to those thoughts otherwise. Hence getting creative opens a window to one’s subconscious which may give them a better understanding of their own potential.</p> <h2>1. Trusting your intuition</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-135.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>When you are faced with a difficult situation and you are looking for answers always listen to your gut feeling. That immediate response that you feel is often the most authentic as your sub-conscious has already decided on the matter and when you faced the confrontation with a difficult situation you got a quick answer. It may be that you would not be able to explain why you felt that particular way but in your heart of hearts you know you felt right. That is because your subconscious is always in direct communication with your conscious and vice-versa. The decisions made are often accurate and astonishingly appropriate for the situation at hand.</p> <p>Now keeping in mind the above four ways to connect with your subconscious, we would like to make things a little more interesting for you. Let’s start to jog our subconscious into action by taking the following test and determine what kind of thoughts are housed in our subconscious. So take a pen and paper and try to answer the following questions as quickly as possible: remember the natural instincts enable immediate responses. Just do not forget to let your imagination fly and do not feel bounded by whatever may come to your head.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-136.jpeg"/>Shutterstock     <p>Did you find the anecdotes helpful and accurate? At least they made you delve a little more into your thought process to fish out the answers to these simple questions. Not bad to shake up that subconscious a little and see what thoughts reside in it concerning life matters.</p>   <i></i>
