         <i></i>   <i></i>   <i></i> 2<p>This is an ultimate guide to see what you are like under the sheets according to your zodiac sign. We all know that all zodiac signs are different in nature and come with their unique set of traits. How these set of traits translate into your romantic and sex life is a something to see. This article explain what you are like with your lover and how you like it.</p> <h2>Aries always targets a quickie</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-78.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>Aries is considered to be the first zodiac sign in the list of zodiacs – well, ‘first’ being universally applicable, ONLY to the individual embodying the Aries sun sign. Universe being the operational word, an Aries is his/her own center of universe – or rather, the Aries is the sun and the earth revolves around it, in a manner of speaking. Their dominant nature is their language of communication for most parts. Whether it’s ‘spur of the moment’, or a well thought out decision, they are sure to see and understand everything by means of their own unique thought process. Amidst the individualistic nature of a true Aries, also lies, a need to love and feel loved in return. It is this essential trait that works to soften a more, shall we say, hardened Aries heart.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-79.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>That desperate need to get down right and about business, but with little to no time? We’ve all been there, haven’t we? The sheer thrill of plunging into an epic ‘Speedy Gonzales’ moment really gets that blood pumping for you. Being the first sign of the Zodiac means bearing more burden – the kind of burden that is “strong and hot and heavy,” Yes, the good kind, the satisfying kind. For an Aries to deny such a raring, fleeting moment of passion and heat, would deny the very essence of an Aries’s nature. And quite literally, since an ‘on top’ position that ensures quick climaxing would be undeniably satisfying. Or better yet, try a position where you’re on top of your partner, which will allow you to twist and twirl (think of an Arab tent and a sensual belly dancer) toward a more fantasy laden, climaxing conclusion.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image.gif"/>  <h2>Taurus always likes it slow</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-80.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>Speaking of being slow, passivity is what essentially defines a Taurus zodiac bearer. They generally come across as being minimalistic when it comes to sharing a few lines or reacting in an instant. The comfort of being one’s own comfort zone is what the true Taurus zodiac enjoys most. The need to remain passive and slow springs out of the urge to remain attached to comfortable surroundings. Passivity may govern the zodiac’s primary mode of interaction, but underneath, also lies a strength which is its secondary mode. Being slow doesn’t mean one stops absorbing all other emotional triggers. The general goal of the Taurus zodiac is to remain immersed within themselves, alongside a partial presence on the outside. There is a tranquil balance of sorts, until it is disrupted and or disturbed.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-81.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>In accordance with what has been contextualized above, a Taurus could linger on for hours. Beginning with a lingering experience like a massage, the ever passive Taurus may gradually move on to acting out generous amounts of foreplay, up until they reach the realms of sexual intercourse itself. The fun in all of it? Consider love making to be an amalgamation of elements that define an eventful day, all in a matter of hours. That slow journey ending up in flames and fireworks after a fiasco of foreplays is agreeably a journey worth making. The inherent need to pursue a love making marathon fantasy speaks for itself. It’s either my way, or the highway. Well, it’s obviously the highway. Kicking things from first gear into fifth is the goal, besides timing them. It is this slow and sensual journey that serves to be pleasurable for a Taurus zodiac in terms of longevity and satisfaction.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-1.gif"/>The Polish Brothers via Giphy <h2>A Gemini’s sex life is flirtatious and adventurous</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-82.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>A Gemini brain can be understood as being ‘too quick for its own good’. This zodiac sign is the personification of everything that is clever, witty, and intelligently amusing. If you ever happen to come across somebody who seems to be active on both feet, with a random yet articulate outlook, you’ve got your regular Gemini zodiac. It’s like they possess the ability to absorb their surroundings at a 360 degree angle. Having such a fast paced thought process also becomes exhausting for the regular Gemini. After all, being clever also demands the articulation of mental constructs, which itself is mentally draining. One word for the Gemini zodiac – Intriguing.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-83.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>Being a delightful combination of randomness, playfulness and mischievousness, a Gemini zodiac can be turned on by the most little and sometimes unexpectedly sensual and flirty things. The slightest of a lingering touch during a random night of watching their favorite television series with their partner can take a Gemini from completely unaware to turn on pretty fast, especially since something that is fun, comfortable and settling at the same time is something light for the moment. Since the bouts of sexual intimacy are etched in random moments for a Gemini, it’s also inevitable that the need to engage their partner will take place in a considerably comfortable environment. It’ll also be as quick as it is random, so being prepared for that moment is also if utmost importance. A lack in understanding may ruin the brief moment. A Gemini’s sexual scenario can be better described as being light, fun and convenient. Who wants to think about having sexual inter course? With the Gemini, it’s as random as thinking about ending world hunger and ending up with a sensual connection and back to another thought. Feel the moment and go with it, Gemini! Even if they’re showing the weather forecast on television.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-2.gif"/>The Polish Brothers via Giphy <h2>Most romantic out of all – Cancer, they will make ‘notebook’ part 2</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-84.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>Cancerian zodiacs are essentially steadfast and mentally strong individuals. They perseverance knows no bounds. It’s because they are able to execute tasks in an organized and efficient manner, they are also resilient enough to handle pressure well. The stark differences of the Cancerian zodiac rest in the midst of yet a common pattern; emotion. Like any other zodiac, a Cancerian is also prone to emotional stimuluses that breed upon human emotions. This zodiac sign is also a reflection of true emotion and sensitivity. When a cancer zodiac feels down, the outpour of melancholy can be depressingly contagious. Primary emotions of this zodiac sign are ruled by strength and resilience.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-85.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>If being a Cancerian means being a mush ball of sensitivity, then this zodiac’s sex life should have exactly what it needs: everlasting and love struck eye contact, sensually longer kisses, and tons of intimate moments. A Cancerian zodiac is also sometimes associated with labels such as being a tad bit more loving and nurturing. The suitable play for such an instance would demand an intimate position where both partners could maintain eye contact and enjoy flows of sensuality simultaneously. Intimacy for this zodiac is inherent of the need to connect on an emotional and sensual level. More eye contact, less deviation.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-3.gif"/>Giphy <h2>Leos will make sure that they are the center of attention</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-86.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>The zodiac sign of the lion. Could anyone ever dare challenge or mock the king of the jungle? We should think not. Leos, in all their pride and humility are creatures that set themselves apart from the rest of the zodiac gang. Speaking of pride, the lion stands its ground as does the first of the zodiac sign, Aries. The sense of individuality between both zodiacs stands similar. It takes a brave and patient soul to succumb to the rules of the jungle, and the King makes them. This zodiac is also the master of a heart of gold. If Leos take pride in themselves, they also take pride in being masters of a genuinely giving heart. This enables them to help balance out dispersed emotions and also diffuse unfavorable situations.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-87.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>In light of the discussion, a Leo zodiac would feel most comfortable in a situation where they could remain in control of the flow. An intercourse situation that allows them to be fun, in control and Leo-like, may have more favorable outcomes in terms of intimacy. Being in control doesn’t mean one could attempt to go out of control. Where there is a demand for power, there is also one for its balance. Leos should position themselves as such that they’re the ones playing the role of the lead actor while their partner plays more of a supporting role. Fantasies work well with this zodiac as they shed light upon the more imaginative side of the lion. Think of it more as being a minimal shift in the balance of power. The Leo will let you think you’re stealing the show, but it’ll be the lion who will triumph as the victor and King. If anyone’s owning the stage (the bed) tonight, it’s going to be the king of the jungle.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-4.gif"/>Giphy <h2>Virgo gets everything done in less time</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-88.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>Virgos are a fine representation of one who is intelligent, clever and withdrawn. They seem to be social in a comfortable sitting, but offer them an invitation to an unknown social gathering and they’ll retreat with a waving white flag. This zodiac sign is also a mixture of variating emotions. A Virgo can be as strong and intelligent, dedicated and strong, as they can be sensitive. The feeling and need to commit to what feels important can be emotionally draining for the true Virgo. They have a hard time admitting to how they truly feel because they fear moments of vulnerability, yet they can be the most passionate and kind hearted lovers.</p>     <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-89.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>A Virgo’s intelligence is characterized by needs such as being organized, or better yet, accomplished. The point being, that an intimate experience with a Virgo would be better enjoyed around a place and or object which symbolizes the two aforementioned characteristics. Virgos because of being withdrawn, tend to look a little fussy on the exterior, but that has more to do with how vulnerable they feel at the same time. This zodiac sign tends to be more intimate in bed than they lead on to be. The most acceptable moments of intimacy for a Virgo zodiac are better understood as being truthful, organized and mutually accepting.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-5.gif"/>Giphy <h2>If you are a Libra then you want it all</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-90.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>The Libra zodiac also personifies traits such as intelligence, love and peacefulness. Like the Virgo zodiac, Libras are also averse to large and unknown social territories and gatherings. They’re intelligence sets them apart from the rest. Although they may across as being more on the quieter side, they’ll shine a few Rays of brilliance if they feel comfortable enough. They are inherently peaceful in nature and tend to resolve disputes. This zodiac also portrays a tendency to withdraw, and with the withdrawal comes the ‘sloth’ mode. Their usual burst of energy after a withdrawal has ended, is uniquely shocking and appreciable at the same time.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-91.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>If intimacy with a Libra zodiac is in question, one must not forget that in order the harness that burst of energy, their partner would have to withdraw with them. The best moments of intimacy would be best in a manner and setting where the zodiac feels completely safe and at home. They enjoy equality in intimacy as they do in arguments, so they can work well with their feminine charms. With a Libra, it has more to do with taking than giving. If there is an equally acceptable display of sensuality and affection, the mood becomes better and so does the physical moment.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-6.gif"/>Giphy <h2>For Scorpios – ‘Passion’ is the word</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-92.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>This zodiac sign is inclusive of the list of signs that are extremely intelligent. Their biggest strength is their will to keep their emotions in check for as long as they are around people. This zodiac sign is a perfect representation of cloak and dagger. Although they have a good heart and tend to be genuinely friendly, they absorb more than they let out. Their ability to keep their emotions in check (Others too) helps them achieve more. The longevity in foreplay excites the Scorpio zodiac.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-93.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>The Scorpio zodiac is more inclined towards tickling and teasing and keeping the flow going smooth for a longer time. This makes every intimate moment more exciting for the zodiac signs. The inherent need to perform foreplay and a simultaneous need to absorb their partner’s thoughts excited them. This zodiac prefers full body contact, so the closer, the better. Owing to full body contact, the need to feel whole with their partner makes this zodiac a sensual sign. The build up from starting slow to pacing up is what truly excited the Scorpio. After all, who doesn’t like a good story?</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-7.gif"/>Giphy <h2>Sagittarius loves to experiment new things</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-94.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>The archer that is the Sagittarius zodiac. This zodiac sign is one that again, also symbolizes traits of intelligence and straight forwardness (all in good faith though). They are unique individuals with a mind of their own. They’re quirky and friendly gestures are genuine, but so is they’re need to stand correct. Sagittarians come across as being honest individuals who are usually and most often appalled by duplicitous encounters. In circles where they are misunderstood, they tend to be stubborn by standing their ground on what they believe to be true. Because they are true to their nature, they are also true to who they love and who they can trust.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-95.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>A Sagittarius is better known for being intensely and sexually passionate. Experimenting with the archers would work well especially when they trust and intimately love their partner. The need to love and be loved in return is the zodiacs wish. If the intimacy serves to be truthful, it will automatically become sensual. For this zodiac sign, trying new things is what keeps the ball spinning. Trying out different intimate scenarios and discovering new horizons with each experience would surely assure a more satisfying intimate escapade for the archer. Bringing out ‘the crazy’ is what is required.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-8.gif"/>Touchstone Pictures via Giphy <h2>A Capricorn likes to put the work in</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-96.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>Capricorns are generally for accepting of the zodiac signs. The goat. I.e. the zodiac, may take the brunt of the crowd but it is also as resilient as the crowd. They have a more rigid outlook on life with regards to personal experiences. Although they are genuinely honest about how they are, they aren’t quite the same about how they feel. The goat’s ability to persevere regardless of life’s brunt us the zodiac’s primary strength. It helps keep the zodiac’s emotions in check and also helps maintain a balance.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-97.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>For a true Capricorn zodiac, it is of utmost importance to keep moving forward (as the goat must climb the mountain – and climb it shall). Intimacy for a Capricorn zodiac is largely dependent upon their need to feel like they’ve climbed enough. The need to feel wanted and needed is what drives the intimate moment of contact. And if the partner is lucky enough, they’re in for one of the best playful experiences they’ve ever imagined. For this zodiac, beds are not binding. Making use of any place is acceptable only if the connection is true. Surfaces help this zodiac sign in achieving a desired position amidst intimate moments.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-9.gif"/>Lukewessman via Giphy <h2>Aquarius has a wild imagination</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-98.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>The Water Bearer zodiac, better known as the Aquarian zodiac. Wild imagination and boundless mental constructs. If you’re looking for a brain that imagines the unimaginable, it is the Aquarius brain. This zodiac is known for its tactful Intelligence, insane thought process and overtly sensitive dilemmas. Overthinking is an inherent part of the water bearer’s primary mode of processing information. Essentially being introverts, Aquarians are more inclined towards internalizing, unlike extroverts. Their inherent need to overthink things may disrupt their entire thought mechanism, which in turn forces them to withdraw. The zodiac that thinks.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-99.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>Aquarians have an extremely imaginative mind, a mind of their own. They will see everything according to how their thought process uniquely perceives it. Similarly, in context of intimate moments, an Aquarians general tendency to fantasize about different intimate positions where your partner uses an element of surprise is one of the best modes of interaction. For an Aquarian brain, the space that is needed for the brain to explore new boundaries is what drives both partners. To discover each other’s bodies and movements as well each other’s thoughts. The trick is to be as intimate as possible, with eyes closed and brain wandering away in a faraway land.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-10.gif"/>Warner Horizon Television via Giphy <h2>This might not come as a surprise but Pisces likes it in the water</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-100.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock <p>The fish zodiac or Pisces is the last on the list of the zodiac signs. They are generally kind by nature and tend essentially to take the path of minimal resistance. They resort to a few splashes here and there if and when required. The Pisces zodiac seems to fit in well, up until a crisis arises and the zodiac is forced to succumb to the downfall of self. Due to a fear of failing, or actually failing, this zodiac sign may fall prey to depressive tendencies. Relieving oneself of those tendencies would prove to be tough for the fish.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-101.jpeg"/>Shutter Stock     <p>Being a zodiac of the water (the fish) a Pisces would very much enjoy moments of clarity and Intimacy in water. Aquarians being water bearers also have an inert connection with water. In order for this zodiac to achieve water oriented arousal, a swimming pool or a considerably fitting water body would serve as the perfect place to share an intimate moment. The calmness that a Pisces zodiac feels from being in water is what makes the experience so complete. The feeling of letting oneself free in the water and letting the water do all the work would make the experience more desirable and sensual. If a strong feeling of love and trust exists between partners, the experience might even save a Pisces zodiac from withdrawing.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/word-image-11.gif"/>Warner Horizon Television via Giphy   <i></i>
