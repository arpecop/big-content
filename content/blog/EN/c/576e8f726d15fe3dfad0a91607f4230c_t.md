Putting your face on at the start of the day or evening gives you a burst of confidence. Moreover, applying makeup is an art, and generally, maintaining oneself is a necessity.</p> <p>Your lips are one of the focal points of your face after the eyes. We spend big buck on lipstick, lip liners, and lip gloss. However, many may not know just how to get that perfect pout. We’re here to guide you a little!</p> <h2>23. Always Soften First</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-419.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If you start applying lip liner, lip gloss, or lipstick directly, they can chafe your lips. You don’t want this painful occurrence, especially in the dry winters. Hence, always put a swipe of lip balm on your lips before you start working on them.</p> <p>Not only does lip balm work as a foundation for lipstick, it also makes your lips softer. This results in easier, smoother application than otherwise. This lip balm could be store-bought or homemade. You could even look up some tutorials on making your own lip balm. This is a much cheaper and healthier option.</p> <h2>22. Apply in Layers</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-420.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>You may have bought that striking lipstick shade, but what if it’s just too loud to wear? Solve this problem by only putting on a very light layer at first. See if it is working for you so far. If you feel it’s too light apply a little more. This way, you would have some semblance of the shade and a mouth that wouldn’t blind others.</p> <h2>21. The Full Effect</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-421.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Sometimes our lips aren’t looking as full as we wish they would. No need to go for plastic surgery; you can easily achieve a fuller effect with a layering method. This involves putting a dark shade of lipstick on first, and then a light one. The light color should be used just in the center of your mouth.</p> <p>Next, blend the two colors together as much as possible. Voila! You now have a full-looking set of lips.</p> <h2>20. Matting it Up</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-422.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Matte lipsticks are ideal for the evening, and are right now more in fashion than the sparkly or glossy kind. However, you may have a gorgeous shade that you would love to matte up for a more formal look. You don’t have to search around and purchase a matte lipstick in that color, though.</p> <p>You can easily make any lipstick shade matte by putting on your lipstick as normal, then applying some translucent powder. Leave this powder on your lips for a minute or so. You can then take your foundation brush and gently brush away any extra powder.</p> <h2>19. No-Lipstick Lipstick</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-423.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If you’re caught without lipstick, or simply don’t have the shade you require, don’t panic. We usually have Vaseline or some sort of petroleum jelly on hand. Mix a bit of this with any shade of eyeshadow. You can then use a Q-tip or even your fingers to put on the new ‘lipstick’. We recommend going with your fingers, as they would provide a much better and smoother application.</p> <h2>18. Match the Liner</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-424.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>In the market, you would find many lip liners paired up with their matching shade of lipsticks. Whenever possible, try to buy the set of liner and lipstick. This way, you may be sure to have a proper liner for each lipstick you own.</p> <p>Of course, there isn’t always such an option. Even if there is, it could very well be expensive. Hence, make sure to have the basic red, pink, and brown lip liners as part of your makeup stash.</p> <h2>17. Accurate Liner</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-425.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>After matching the colors, drawing an accurate line with your lip liner is essential. This could take some serious sleight of hand, though. However, make things easier for yourself by making the tip of the liner a little blunt.</p> <p>A sharp liner may look good, but it’s not good for a steady line. Hence, use a Q-tip, tissue, or cotton ball to make the too blunter and hence wider.</p> <h2>16. Artistic Tendencies</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-426.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>When you are tired of the lip liners you own, you can save money by mixing them. Apply a couple of shades on your lips, and you may be surprised by the results! You may even be able to match that gorgeous new lipstick you just bought!</p> <h2>15. The Ombre Transition</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-427.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>The ombre method is quite a popular and effective one. What you do here is make your lip edges and corners dark. You then apply thinner and thinner layers until you get to your mouth’s center.</p> <p>This technique would result in your having full-looking and beautiful lips. Don’t make the difference between the center and the edge too striking, though. The difference in shades should be as subtle as possible.</p> <h2>14. Toothbrush Hack</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-428.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>You can achieve soft pink lips by adding a tiny habit to your daily routine. After you brush your teeth every morning and night, rub the toothbrush over your lips. Don’t rub too hard, though.</p> <p>When done regularly, this would remove any dead skin cells from your lips. You would see the result very soon! Just make sure you use a soft-bristled toothbrush, not the hard kind.</p> <h2>13. Plumping Thin Lips</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-429.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If your lips are naturally thin, they’re beautiful that way too. However, sometimes we just want a fuller effect. One hack for achieving this look is by applying lip gloss to just the center of the lips. This would bring focus to that part only, making the whole mouth look plumper than it is.</p> <h2>12. Powder the Gloss</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-430.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Lip gloss is amazing for a light makeup look, but it doesn’t have much staying power. Plus, a little carelessness can have your gloss smeared over your hands or clothes. To avoid such situations, make use of the translucent powder again.</p> <p>All you have to do is put a little bit of powder on your lips after applying the lip gloss. Wait a minute and use a tissue to blot away the excess.</p> <h2>11. Highlighted Lips</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-431.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Your highlighter isn’t just for your cheekbones! If your lipstick is too solid a color, add a glow or shine to it with this product. A bit if highlighter right in the middle of your mouth can instantly sheen them up!</p>     <p>If you don’t have a highlighter on hand, we’ve got you covered! Use some white eye-shadow instead. If you have especially warm skin tones, a nude shade might be better.</p> <h2>10. Accentuate from Above</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-432.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>You can accentuate your mouth better if you’re willing to take a risk. Do this by using your lip liner to draw outside of your lip edges. When you’re done, put your lipstick on as usual.</p> <p>This is a pro trick for achieving a full and defined lip effect. However, make sure you take out some time and practice it earlier. This method may give some a semblance if a clown mouth. You certainly don’t want that at your fancy evening dinner! If it doesn’t work out, opt for a more natural look.</p> <h2>9. Avoid the Dark</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-433.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>If you can help it at all, avoid dark shades of lipstick altogether. These may look good but actually, make for smaller-looking lips. Unless you have very plump lips, to begin with, the small lips look can spoil the overall effect of your makeup.</p> <h2>8. Direction Matters</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-434.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Contrary to popular opinion, you shouldn’t just start applying any lip product from any direction. It’s better to start from the middle of your lips. Then swipe to the edges as required. The effect of this application method is to make your lips stand out and shine! The plumping effect is also not a bad one.</p> <p>On the other hand, some makeup artists recommend putting dots of lipstick or lip gloss on first. From there on, your fingers are the best tool to spread the lipstick to the rest of your mouth.</p> <h2>7. Lip Dye</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-435.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>For a more lasting a natural lip color, make use of food dye. This is a safe and more natural method for making sure your lip color lasts all day. Simply mix a lip peel mask with the color. You then put the combination of products on your lips. In the normal way, the peel mask would dry and you can then peel it off. Once you remove all of it, you would have your dyed lips of choice.</p> <h2>6. Conditioning isn’t just for hair</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-436.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>It may surprise you, but it is actually possible to condition your lips! First, make use of a lip scrub. This would get rid of any flakes and prevent cracking.</p> <p>Lips scrubs are available in the market, but it’s super easy to whip one up in a matter of minutes! All you need are some sugar and honey. Combine a teaspoon of both, and rub the mixture over your wet lips. Keep the water warm and your motions circular! You would also need to rinse off your lips with warm water when you’re done. The scrubbing itself shouldn’t last for more than a few minutes. The toothbrush hack described above could also come in handy for everyday exfoliation.</p> <p>The next step in lip conditioning is moisturization. When you’re done scrubbing, don’t forget to put some moisturizing cream or a proper lip moisturizer for good measure. When all else fails, coconut oil works just as well.</p> <p>Conditioning your lips is essential if they are prone to flaking or painful cracks. The problem with lips is that they can lose their natural luster very easily. Hence, one needs to take good care of them and let them breathe once in a while. Make lip conditioning a part of your beauty routine instead of covering up all the defects with a bright lip color.</p> <h2>5. Lip Nourishment</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-437.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>You should also consider purchasing a good lip serum. Again, we can also provide you with a recipe for a homemade one! This is like a face mask in several ways. Simply combine a teaspoon of honey or aloe with a teaspoon of coconut or olive oil. Rub it all into your lips and let it soak in for no less than ten minutes. Afterwards, you would have to rinse it off using warm water.</p> <p>The effect of the serum is that it leaves your lips moisturized, clean and bright. This means that you can even go out with your natural lips for a casual day. If you apply the serum after exfoliation, you can have your lips looking their best for a long, long time.</p> <h2>4. Natural Plumping</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-438.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Lip plumping kits are definitely out there, but you don’t want to expose your lips to such methods! Injections and vacuum-like object are, needless to say, best kept away from your face. No one but you would have to suffer the consequences if something goes wrong with using these techniques.</p> <p>Luckily, you can make your lips naturally plumper by enhancing the blood circulation in them. All you need to do here is mix up something that can attract blood to your lip area. There’s no technical knowledge involved; just a bit of healthy know-how.</p> <p>These pictures could come in many shapes and forms. One is achieved by combining a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon and a half teaspoon of olive or coconut oil. Another picture is one-eighth of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and a half teaspoon of coconut or olive oil. Alternatively, just rub a piece of fresh ginger or even a piece of jalapeno over your mouth. Make sure your mouth isn’t falling, though, because the last method can really sting you then!</p> <h2>3. Everyday Moisturizing</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-439.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Make sure you moisturize your lips even when you don’t exfoliate them. Whatever you eat, your lips touch it first. Hence, your lips have to do quite a lot of work during the day. Surely they deserve some pampering on the regular! The air pollution in most cities, along with exposure to the wind and sun, are just more reasons for upping your lip care routine.</p> <p>Moisturizing would not only keep your lips soft but protect them from outside elements. If you can, invest in a lip balm that also provides sunscreen properties. This would prevent discoloration as well as harm from UV rays.</p> <h2>2. Go for Homemade Balm</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-440.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>We recommend using a natural lip balm very early on here. You can easily make one right now if you have shea butter or coconut butter/oil, and a bit of Vitamin E oil. Beeswax is also good for this project, provided you can get your hands on it.</p> <p>For starters, melt the butter with the beeswax, and create a nice smell with an essential oil. This could be lavender, rose, or whatever you please. However, the oil is not absolutely necessary. For color, some people use real strawberries, blackberries, or raspberries. If you have none of those on hand, creates your own tiny by putting a bit of lipstick in the mixture.</p> <p>Finally, pour the balm into a tiny empty pot and wait for it to cool. If you have used fruit as your coloring, it is best to keep this balm in the fridge during the warm weather. You would also have to use it up within the month. However, we truly feel that the natural way is always the healthy way to go!</p> <h2>1. Choose Complementing Colors</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-441.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>When you’re looking for a lip color, be sure to do your homework and know which color suits you. This is not a matter of dark or light complexions only, but also the skin tones underneath. One may have a dark complexion with yellow tones or a light complexion with the same kind of undertone. Hence, their lipstick choice may not be as different as from those with pink undertones.</p> <p>Your skin tone could also be neutral, warm, or cool. You could best decide upon your skin tone by noticing what kind of jewelry or clothing looks best on you. For instance, you may feel most at home in warm colors like yellow, red, or brown. You could prefer the way gold jewelry looks on your skin rather than silver. If this is indeed the case, then you most likely have warm skin tones.</p> <p>Hence, you would be best suited to lipstick shades that are neutral, coral pink, orangish-red, or even brown. Again, we would recommend that you not go very dark if you want your lips to stand out. The neutral shades should also be on the creamy side.</p> <p>Lipsticks with cool tones are for those who feel their skin tone is best complemented by jewel colors such as navy blue or a solid red. Hence, a plum, lavender pink or bright red lipstick is best here. You may have to do some experimentation as well as research before you hit on the perfect range of lip colors.</p>     <p>Having the perfect lips can have you looking awesome with minimal effort. Be sure to give your lips the treatment they deserve, and they would reward you multifold.</p>   <i></i>
