Now there’s no rocket science behind the idea of acknowledging her efforts; you simply have to sit with her, get comfortable and tell her that what she’s doing for you and the house is something which touches your heart and that you’re grateful about it.</p> <p>Such little words of love can actually melt her and make her determined enough to make more efforts because you actually validate her on doing the right thing which is actually making both of your bond stronger by the day.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-881.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Have you ever thought about the time when you are gone to work all day from 9-5, absorbed in all the tasks of the day, thinking about nothing else but a perfect project and promotion? Well that’s pretty mainstream but what guys don’t realize is that their spouse actually misses them the minute they say goodbye. So there is actually a solution to it.</p> <p>You must agree with the fact that there are short intervals in between work where you just take tea or stare down at the traffic from your office. So next time you decide to take a break between your work, try sending her a message telling her how much you miss her and that you are looking up to a long drive after dinner with her. These kinds of gestures will make her get closer with you and surely feel special in her relationship.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-882.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>It’s a fact about humans is that they are not born perfect. There are some of the flaws in every person’s life which are hard to change but the key to it is to overlook them. Just like others, your spouse might have a bad past, a prominent flaw on the body or personality but it doesn’t mean you will force her to change it. You must realize that she has accepted your shortcomings before you realized and expects you to accept her however she is; that will basically make her believe that you love her truly.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-883.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>A person is very comfortable in his own version of skin and if an external force unexpectedly tries to replace it with something of their likings then there’s no way they can make them feel good about themselves. Applying the wisdom to your relationship with her if you really want to grow old smiling with her, then you have to accept the way she talks, eats, wears and most importantly her choices.</p> <p>This definitely doesn’t apply when you want someone to change for good because of something harmful and they acknowledge your intentions behind it. That’s one of the gestures which can make her feel important too but changing little details about her like her haircut, the way she speaks and smiles then it is going to be very hard for her to feel good about herself.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-884.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>When hurt, she will choose you to be the first person to share what’s wrong. So if you want to make her feel good once again, then you will have to focus on feeling the pain she’s feeling. Empathy is something which can make you grow that special care for the person you love and that special care is compassion. If a husband and wife is compassionate about each other, then they will not even think about finding secondary sources to make them feel better.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-885.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Every person has to be a good listener to grow compassion. If a guy isn’t good at listening to her telling him about her problems, then chances are that she will think he doesn’t care. Guys normally do care about her problems but don’t know how to listen carefully; they will fiddle with their phones, stare at the tv or a book despite the fact that they’re paying attention to what she’s saying.</p> <p>The right way to be a good listener is to leave everything aside and look into her eyes as she tells you what’s wrong. Another point to remember is to not give opinions midway in the conversation because she just wants to let her feelings out in order to feel lighter, so avoid that.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-886.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>There has been a huge misconception among guys that girls get offended on honest remarks. Surprised? Well that’s true. If you be honest with her regarding all sorts of matter, she will actually trust you with even improving her personality.</p> <p>That’s because honesty makes them know about where they need to improve and if you lie to them just to make them happy, then they will be hurt after realizing the fact that you aren’t serious it. Also, try to be honest in a way that she thinks you are helping her out instead of being rude or blunt about it.</p>     <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-887.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Arguments are one of the things which are experienced in marriage very often, but what really matters is how you make up after a fight. Most of the bonds get weaken because partners keep everything to themselves about what hurts them a lot in general. It can be something as small as being too busy or as big as eating out and not letting them know despite a feast prepared back home.</p> <p>The best way to fix everything up is to be open with her on what hurts you in general or the things you’re insensitive about, for example a bad childhood. This thing is actually near to honesty and she can appreciate your maturity on how you’re trying to tell her about the things you don’t like and trust me, she will avoid it in future.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-888.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Between spouses, the strength of bond is a crucial thing to focus on. That’s because it is something which gives the validation about the love being genuine. If you want her to feel that you don’t want to lose her at all cost, then make efforts to improve the bond you both have. These efforts include the thoughtfulness to actually make her feel comfortable in her skin and less affected by her little insecurities.</p> <p>Try by telling her how wonderful she is randomly or when she immediately wakes up; this will give her an idea that you love her no matter how messed up she looks or acts sometimes. Also, if you actually comfort her when she is in a bad mood, it will instantly make her absorb the vibes about you putting up with her despite her pushing you away.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-889.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Life is colorful, it drags us toward s different scenarios in order to give us the experience we need to become mature for future challenges but sometimes these ups and downs in life gives a touch of pessimism to us about life in general. To counter that, another person is always needed who can help us reconsider our opinions about life.</p> <p>It’s been noticed that women in general have a hard time trusting others in general due to life experiences and you will notice it with her alongside other things she don’t consider talking about. The solution to fix all this is positivity; remember that they reached there at the first place because no one really took time to make things clear for them. If you put positive logic in front of her, then it can actually help her change the way she feels about life; eventually feeling happier every day.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-890.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Women love unexpected surprises and it makes them get closer to you. Since chocolate are seen to have this magical effect on their mood, you should consider buying her a bar once in a while and surprise her especially when she’s low.</p> <p>The science behind these kinds of gestures is that a present tells women that their spouse can’t stand the fact that they are sad and to kick it out of their lives, they surprise them with cute gestures like these. So it’s a win for a man to care and get an extra credit for such a small gesture.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-891.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Women value caring attention from their loved ones and look up to it. If someday you see that she is upset about something and you find yourself busy with some small house chore, then choose to give her the useful attention she needs because it will actually make her feel special and give her the idea that you prefer making her feel better first, before anything else and trust me, she does notice you leaving the work you were stuck with; this can actually influence your bond positively.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-892.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Alongside openness, women do expect their partners to be open with regarding what they feeling deep inside their heart. Expressing love is one of such things but what if I mention the sorrows? You see, there’s a barrier between you and her until you decide to get out of your shell to tell her about all the things which make you feel worse. This can be about a bad past, bullying at school or anything that you’re embarrassed to talk about with other people but her.</p> <p>Doing this can actually help her grow compassion for you and don’t fear that she will sympathize; if she really loves you, then she will prefer empathizing instead and you will notice a positive change in the way she makes efforts for you.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-893.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Well there’s no doubt in mentioning that women are crazy about those abs but that can be one of the stereotypes. Fitness in general is attractive for her because she actually feels that you do it to keep yourself healthy and in-shape. This will make her think that you take interest in making her feel complete in the relationship because not taking care of yourself is generally considered a sign of hopelessness and lack of interest which can make her assume otherwise.</p> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-894.jpeg"/>Tapoos.com <p>Sense of humor is one of the most common traits of men to attract women. Women in general love to laugh and want a break from the mainstream ups and downs of life. If you can actually make an effort to put a smile on her fact, then she will consider you someone who prefers enjoying life to the fullest and eventually start liking you more.</p>     <p>One of the things women like about men is the trait of being themselves – It makes you look genuine and trustworthy as a person. If you found these secrets useful, then make sure to share it generously with the newly married guys who are up for a successful bond in the married life.</p>   <i></i>
