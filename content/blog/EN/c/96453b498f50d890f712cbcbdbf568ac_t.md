However, some researchers might beg to differ a little about the validity of this statement. Researchers claim that it is not only your eyes that have a lot to say but in fact, your whole face can talk a lot provided you are a willing listener. According to the standards set by some reports, physical features can be more revealing about your real personality than any other form of a quiz.</p> <p>This research is backed by significant amounts of statistical data that connects common physical traits to hugely specific personality traits that are the same across several people. Many branches of research and academics are showing a keen interest in this subject and are advancing the scope of their research.</p> <p>Scientists believe that several inferences can be drawn about your health and personality, all on the basis of your exterior traits. This makes significant sense considering the significant role that genes and hormones play in our lives.</p> <p>While this may sound widely exaggerated, there are concrete facts to back it all up. A researcher going by the name of Carmen Lefevre at Northumbria University conducted a study on American presidents and how they were perceived by the general public. She reached the conclusion that many participants based their opinions about a President’s character, based solely on the shape of his face.</p> <p>Consciously or unconsciously, the trust that we put into another person depends greatly on what they look like from the outside.</p> <p>However, it is obviously a complex and inexact science. You can’t really figure out someone’s life story by looking at the space between their eyebrows, neither can you determine someone’s leading character traits based on the shape of their hands.</p> <p>However, the data is accurate enough to give us a small insight into the traits of people. While not always entirely accurate, this data gives away enough to pique interest.</p> <p>Curious? Here are eight ways in which your physical features might be linked to your personality.</p> <h2>Facial Width</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1736.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>People with significantly wider faces, with generally bigger cheekbones and facial structure (like Sylvester Stallone or Sarah Palin), have greater levels of testosterone. Aggravated levels of this hormone makes them more likely to be aggressive than someone with a relatively narrower frame.</p> <p>This does not mean that you will find them fighting left, right and center. However, such people do tend to react to quarrels, facing conflict rather than avoiding it. Psychologists perceive this trait as an evolutionary advantage. They think that this is nature’s way of making people more likely to be able to deal with conflict. Moreover, people with wider faces are also linked to being more assertive and confident.</p> <p>This bizarre link between physical and characteristic traits extends past humans. Capuchin monkeys are seen to follow the findings of this trait too. They elect their leaders based solely on how wide their faces are!</p> <p>If you have fallen prey to curiosity and want to measure your face, compare the distance between your ears with the distance between your eyes and upper lip: the common ratio is roughly 2. Anything higher than this and you have an officially wide face!</p> <h2>The Size of the Cheeks</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1737.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Of all the bizarre things that can be used to measure your health, this is definitely one of the weirdest. Researchers believe that the size of your cheeks could bear a direct relation to your health. If your cheeks are on the fuller side, you might not be as healthy as you might like to think. Research points to evidence that people with fuller cheeks are in fact more susceptible to catching infections and being sick.</p> <p>Moreover, the sickness period for them lasts longer than for people with relatively smaller cheeks. As if that isn’t mad enough, people with fuller faces have been seen to be more likely to suffer from diseases like depression and anxiety.</p> <h2>Skin Tone</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1738.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Recent research that has been done on the variation in skin tone and health are not centered on ethnicity. Rather, researchers are now focusing on the different undertones of skin and what brings about these stark differences.</p> <p>For anyone who has shopped for a foundation or a flattering red lipstick, undertones are not a new term! Undertones are barely discernible tints under everyone’s skin and more often than not, they reflect our lifestyle choices. For example, having a golden undertone to your skin might mean you have great overall health. The gold undertone is linked to how many fruits and vegetables you consume in your diet.</p>     <p>Carotenoids are orange and naturally found pigments in fresh fruits and vegetables. These help you get a stronger immune system all while showing up as an undertone if you are eating a lot of them.</p> <p>On the other hand, does your skin have a pink undertone? Having rosy skin is an indicator of having a generally active lifestyle. Moreover, a woman having a red undertone to her skin might be linked to her fertility cycle and is being caused by her being near her ovulation period.</p> <h2>Ears</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1739.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>According to face readers, there are several ear types and each of them represent something different.</p> <p>According to master face reader Joey Yap, there are 50 ear types and each represents intelligence. People who have ears that stick out, are more prone to enjoy being in the limelight. People who have generally flat ears are more opinionated while people with top heavy ears are more intelligent.</p> <h2>Nose Shape</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1740.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Noses are more telling than you might like to think. Having a big nose has been linked directly to positive personality traits like ambition, confidence and self-reliance, making them born leaders of the proverbial pack. They might get a little emotional but that just makes it easier for them to be passionate leaders.</p> <p>Is your nose generally small but has a large tip? Well you might do well in the finance industry. People whose noses are not here not there, not blunt or sharp tend to be sweet, endearing and mild tempered.</p> <p>People with longer noses don’t need to despair either. They are energetic, quick to make decisions and stick to them and have strong intuition.</p> <h2>Hands</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1741.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Hands are a strong giveaway about people’s personalities and character traits. Men with relatively longer ring fingers tend to be more attractive, however, their good looks come at the price of being bad drivers. People with stubby index fingers lack confidence. However, if your little finger stands out from the crowd, it shows that you have an outgoing personality and enjoy making independent decisions.</p> <h2>Eyes</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1742.jpeg"/>Shutterstock <p>Eyes are probably the hardest feature to link to specific personality traits on account of varying widely throughout. A study was conducted on around 500 participants and it was found out that iris patterns are linked to personality traits. Miniscule clusters, known as crypts, packed around the pupil can actually be an indicator of how reliable a person is in a crisis.</p> <p>People with deeply packed clusters tend to be more trustworthy and empathetic, while those sparse clusters tend to be a little more on the neurotic side. On the other hand, light eyed women generally experience less pain during childbirth while dark haired women require less alcohol to feel tipsy. This is on account of a greater amount of melanin in the blood, making their brain function more efficient.</p> <h2>Eyebrows</h2> <img src="https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1743.jpeg"/>Shutterstock     <p>As of the past few years, eyebrows have been having a huge moment of sorts. People with eyebrows that end abruptly are known to have a more volatile life when growing up. People with thick dark brows are friendly and love to enjoy with their friends. However, people with sparse eyebrows are great with following instructions and directives, but not great with thinking on their feet. Messy brows might be an indication of an overall messy life and people with upward pointing brows generally make great leaders.</p>   <i></i>
