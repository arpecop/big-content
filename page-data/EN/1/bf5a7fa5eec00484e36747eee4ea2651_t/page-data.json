Unfortunately, they are also quite common. They are also triggered by everyday events, such as loud noises, stress, or tiredness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Usually, we turn to over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers to relieve the throbbing in our head. However, these can have dangerous side effects and can even be useless if our bodies get used to them. Hence, a better option is to use natural remedies, especially acupressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Acupressure is a method which can cure a headache in no more than five minutes! It’s even been scientifically proven to have a positive effect when applied correctly. Without further ado, let’s see what acupressure actually is and how it can cure a headache:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What is Acupressure?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2199-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The acupressure procedure is a Chinese healing method. This Oriental treatment has its roots in traditional medicinal practices. Although it is not the conventional method today, many doctors see no harm in it. In fact, some may even recommend acupressure and acupuncture as some effective means of relieving pain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A degree in medical science is not necessary in order to practice acupressure. In fact, one probably doesn’t even need to visit a practitioner for treatment. If the symptoms are slight enough, one can start off by learning a few simple techniques. They can thus treat themselves at home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How Long Does it Take?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2199-2-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;An acupressure massage also doesn’t take very long. In fact, it is ideal for the busy workers of modern life. As long as one is relaxing in a comfortable position, the massage can quickly work wonders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If one is a stickler for time, an acupressure massage may only take thirty seconds. It could also take one minute, or more if you like it that much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The points on your way to relief&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2199-3-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;There are around six main points where one has to concentrate and massage. Light circular or firmly pressing movements are the most effective. Five minutes is usually the maximum time one takes to get rid of a nasty headache this way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below are some details on the points to massage using acupressure. There are details and sub-details within this area as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Yintang Point: The Third Eye&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2199-4-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Most of us have heard or read of a third-eyed monster. In the realm of Oriental medicine, all of us possess a third eye of our own. As in most stories, this eye is also situated between the eyebrows. It basically acts as a connection between the nose and forehead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A headache is usually no more than eye fatigue. In order to rule out this sort, massage this point. If it helps, you may be done much sooner than expected!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Zan Zhu Points: Relieving the Sinus&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2199-5-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;There are different kinds of headaches and different points to deal with them. A sinus headache, for instance, is best relieved by the symmetrical Zan Zhu points. The medial ends of the eyebrows are the place for activating and massaging these points. One minute should be all it takes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This basic region is also called Bright Light by some practitioners. Perhaps it is called so because it is the inner corner of the eye or the other side of the nose’s bridge. In any case, it is located near the eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Massaging these points could relive one from sinus headaches, allergies, and also serve to enhance one’s vision. It is best if one massages these points at the same time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Yingxiang Points: The Nose Knows&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2199-6-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;These points are to be found on both sides of your nose. More specifically, they are located at the nostrils. If we draw a line from these points to our eyes, we’d probably poke our eyes out. However, we’re only saying that one has to massage these points in order to relieve tension headaches and blocked sinuses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is important to note here that different individuals could feel relaxed with different forms of pressure. To be on the safe side, it is best to start with a mild pressure. We can then work our way up and increase the pressure until we’re relaxed. Nevertheless, it is essential to adopt a direct massage to this point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Shuai Gu Points: The Temple Region&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2199-7-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;These points are to be found in between the hairline and what is known as the temple. When one massages this area, it relaxes the eyes. This would hopefully also relieve any pain in the surrounding areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, there are no less than five acupoints on the Temple Region. They are banded together here because they are all in the same place, more or less. In fact, the distance between them is usually no more than one finger width. They are to be found curling up right along the ear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Missing these five points at once could generally relieve migraine headaches. Those who suffer from these horrible instances would surely appreciate the acupressure practice. Painkillers often have little to no effect on a migraine, so any alternative would be a lifesaver! Since the pressure points are on the side of the head, they deal directly with the main problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Neck Region: 3 Points&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2199-8-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Headaches have a lot to do with the neck and shoulder region. In fact, there are no less than three points in this area for acupressure purposes. These three are called Wind Pool, Heaven’s Pillar, and Shoulder Well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since this is a large region and each point serves a different purpose, it’s best if they are explained separately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Neck Region: Wind Pool&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2199-9-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Basically, Wind Pool is situated at the back of the head, between the ear and spine. It gets most of its power from the two muscles coming together at the back of the head and neck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Putting pressure on this point would greatly help in relieving a migraine headache. It also helps in doing away with nasal congestion. As an added bonus, the correct pressure here could also clear up pain in the ears, throat, and eyes.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;Neck Region: Heaven’s Pillar&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2199-10-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The Heaven’s Pillar points are also known as the Tian Zhu points. They are aptly named because this region is located below the Wind Pool. It has to do with the side muscles alongside the spine. Its exact location starts somewhere from two fingers’ length below the skull.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When pressed or massaged properly, the Heaven’s Pillar serves to alleviate pain in the back of your head or neck. This could also help with insomnia, pain from stiff neck muscles, stress, and eye strain. Hence, it is no doubt a valuable massage point in the modern world. The use of mobile technology such as smartphones and laptops has made us suffer in exactly these areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Neck Region: Shoulder Well&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2199-11-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;This last point in the Neck Region is situated between the shoulder point and the neck’s end. Basically, one should look for it where the shoulder ends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stiffness and pain in the shoulder and neck area are best treated by putting pressure on this point. What’s more, this type of messaging can even help out asthma patients as well as those with muscle spasms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best pressure applied here is a direct and penetrating kind. The recommended time is from two to five minutes, depending on the extremity of the pain. One can massage for the recommended amount of time or until they feel enough relief to stop.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Hand Point: Union Valley&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2199-12-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The Hand points are also known as the He Gu points. The He Gu points are also symmetrical. However, they are not located on the face but between the thumb and forefinger. Massaging these points in a correct manner would cure one’s headaches.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This result is mainly because these points deal with stress within the nerves. Massaging them would relieve the stress and hence the headache as well. This method is best for curing frontal headaches, back pain, and even toothache. It mainly releases tension from the neck and head. However, tooth pain may be caused by something other than tension, so acupressure may not help in this case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Foot Point: Moving Between&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2199-13-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The focal point of acupressure on the foot is the part between the big toe and the second toe. This is also called the Moving Between part. When pressure is applied here, eye strain and foot cramps are hopefully relived. Hence, headaches are also alleviated through this method.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Massaging this point works best when the same pressure is applied to the Union Valley point. Thus, one may need to work on their hand and foot at the same time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A Warning to All&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2199-14-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;If the problem is serious or recurring, such as migraine headaches, it is best not to rely on yourself. When it comes to acupressure, one may try it out at home, but it’s most effective in an expert’s hands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is also best not to apply too direct or firm a pressure if you are not a qualified practitioner. You may experiment a bit, but not go overboard. This is because if the wrong pressure is put on the wrong point, you may do more harm than good. These points are powerful tools towards healing, just like any doctor’s tools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Acupressure is regarded as an alternative healing method. As such, one should always consult with their medical advisor before going for such a treatment. The best part about them is that when used properly, they have no side-effects. This is a great advantage when compared to conventional modern medicine. If the latter is used too much, it can create havoc within the body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Acupressure also has several levels, some of which are less invasive than others. It is recommended that one start with the lower levels in order to get used to the treatment. However, conventional allopathic doctors would usually not give guarantees on Oriental medical practices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How acupressure saves the day&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2199-15-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Acupressure does relieve pain, but some may question the procedure. The basic reason behind this method is scientific. When one puts pressure on a certain point, the body obviously responds. It releases tension and any other blockage in that specific area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plus, blood circulation goes up through the applied pressure. This again is instrumental in resolving many physical issues within the body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Super-fast healing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2199-16-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;When you take a pill, it usually takes some time to have an effect. In fact, if you have taken the same pill several times before, it would take longer to work. Acupressure does not have this time factor, nor does one become immune to it. The amount of pressure needed may vary, but the method remains the same.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is mainly because acupressure works to loosen the tensed muscles. This increases blood circulation and gathers the whole body’s energy for better healing. The result then is a faster way of curing many kinds of illnesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Path to Calmness&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2199-17-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The act of massaging itself is designed to calm you down. By putting pressure on certain points, one’s mind actually starts working better. In this manner, it becomes more able to cope with stress and do away with negativity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, those who love to meditate should also add acupressure to their routine. Even when one doesn’t have a headache, it can be a great preventative measure. The relaxation one feels further goes to prevent future illnesses and diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Helps you feel great!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2199-18-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Acupressure applies pressure on certain sensitive points. Needless to say, goes points are also related to several organs within the body. The belief behind this method is that there is a vital energy that flows throughout the entire body. This energy may be called chi or qui.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The flow of the energy is along certain meridians. When they get blocked, one feels stress and its physical consequences. This blockage can also result in several diseases. Acupressure can unlock these areas through massage. If the situation is a bit more serious, one may also turn to acupuncture for relief. However, a qualified practitioner is necessary in this case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bolstering your Beauty&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2199-19-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Finally, acupressure is also commonly used for cosmetic purposes. When one presses the right points, the blood flow is stimulated. This helps to tone the facial muscles. It also helps in producing collagen, which allows for skin flexibility and smoothness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of these messages together can help to tone your face naturally. Thus, you would have a wrinkle-free face for most of your days!&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Release muscular tension: Acupressure helps relieve tension from muscles by stimulating the action of nerves feeding the muscles. It also helps bring down stress levels and relaxes the entire body helping in the release of tension from them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Acupressure Science: 19 Points on Curing Headaches Without Pills","description":"Guidelines on the acupressure regions which can cure headaches"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/1/bf5a7fa5eec00484e36747eee4ea2651_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/1/c80cdffaf1b27bdf185d43f50a1e2231_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"7 Ways to Get Closer to a New Partner Without Rushing the Relationship"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/1/bcc171c61f6c55563c0744b934a55d71_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Weird Things Caught by Customs Officials at Airports"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
