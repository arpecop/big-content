Be it a someone trying to jump a queue for no reason to that distant relative of yours you see after years, who can’t help but pass comments about the way you talk, walk, dress or even breathe. Don’t worry. Take a deep breath, and compose yourself. While it may be incredibly tempting to fight fire with fire and get them with a savage comeback that will roast them to a crisp, let’s face facts here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These comebacks only come to our minds in the shower. Seven hours later. Why must this be, brain! Why must you betray us? Alas. It might just be for own good. Sometimes, maybe the other person isn’t an idiot is genuinely having a bad day. Here are some helpful tips in containing the roaring tiger within, and floating like a butterfly. And yes, stinging like a bee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Oh hey, congratulations!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1029.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Picture this. You’re craving a Big Mac and some fries, and you deserve a nice meal anyways. You drive up to the local McDonalds and you’re pulling into the Drive Thru. You’ve placed your order and are ready to collect it, but the cashier is taking too long to process your transaction. You ask, as politely as you can as to what the hold-up is, and they tell you their link is down and your card keeps getting declined. Just another day, you tell yourself. You turn the radio up, because music always keep you great company when you’re waiting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’re calm, composed and relaxed when suddenly the guitar solo turns into a car horn solo. There’s no Surround Sound here, it’s the impatient person in the car behind you. You take a look in the rearview mirror and this person is now out of their car, storming towards you. You’re still calm and roll down your window when they come address you for your fault. How do you explain to an angry and potentially hungry person that this isn’t your fault? Well, you could step out of the car and punch them in the throat, or you could scream at them till they run away. If you do either of these, you’re no different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diffuse the situation by listening to them and telling them once they’re done, “Oh hey! Congratulations!”. They’ll stop, guaranteed. Confused, they’ll walk back to their car. If they don’t stop though, give them a hearty “Happy new year!” it’s foolproof! Bonus points for maintaining a sweet tone!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Mail me&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1030.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;You can’t go to bed with a heavy heart, because let’s face it. You’re part of the crowd that is humane and sensitive. If this holds true for you, congratulations. We’re proud of you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You always spend a nice and long hour with your spouse in bed, talking about all that happened at work today and how that one old man cut you off really bad at the intersection but you forgive him. You’re always down for a heart-to-heart with your best friend too, and you don’t even mind shedding a tear or two in letting it all out. There is one problem though. Some people are just born with a mission to ruin your day, or so it seems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter what you do, they’ll show up out of nowhere and try to take a swing at what is an otherwise pretty decent day. In this category, we sympathize most with the office-goers. That lady from accounting who always seems to meet you at the coffee machine, only to rant about the most useless things ever and then waste your time by commenting on how bad your hair looks today – yeah, you know who. That lady is toxic for you but you can’t avoid her because as we said, then you would be the same. There’s a fix and you can thank us later. Ask her to mail you about it. Seriously, ask her to type it out since you’ll remember it better that way. According to convincing research, she will actually never mail you, and she will also stop crossing paths with you since you’ll have cornered her into shooting out a mail. Problem solved. Bye, Felicia!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. There won’t be a next time&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1031.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;You’re finally settled in the big city and work is going good, surprisingly. You’re moving up the corporate ladder at a comfortable pace and you think it’s a good time to start seeing people now. You find the perfect match online and before you know it – you’re both meeting over dinner at the local diner on Friday night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’re looking great, the cleaners have done a great job with your dress and you just realized you love the diner too! He’s here, and he looks even better than he did in the pictures. But, twenty minutes in, all that’s happened is that you’re tired of hearing about the match his club lost last night, you’re worn out by his weird gaming stories and you’re absolutely done with the way he calls over the waitress to complain about the burger falling apart too often. Your eyes are rolling and your feet are tapping. Finish him! You tell yourself as he launches into another gaming story. Throw his Coke in his face and flip the table already! Hold up! There’s a better way to deal with this.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Instead of doing anything to him, give him sympathy. More than he needs. Sympathize with him to the extent that he gets a clue as to what you’re getting at. And then, smile and leave. They say people like your unfortunate date are the way they are because they’re hurting. They’re really hurting. Do yourself a favor, leave.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. I’m sensitive&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1032.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Your favorite aunt is back in town after three whole years! You missed her so much – there’s so much catching up to do! You’ve arranged a lovely family dinner and rescheduled your weekend commitments so the whole family can come together for some food and some laughs. This is going to be great! You’re super excited! But oh, you realize. It’s your aunt’s dinner so of course your uncle, who is her brother, is also invited. You try to explain to your mom that he’ll ruin the whole evening and you should even consider cutting off any ties with him. The invites have been sent though and you can’t exclude just one person, let alone ask them to not come!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You accept your fate. Dinner is served and so it begins. He’s reminded everyone three times about that when you accidentally fell face first in a puddle of mud and he’s been going on about how you’re so skinny and will never amount to much in life. You’re seeing red. You want to push him in the fireplace so he’ll be quiet once and for all. Or, even worse, you might be considering harming yourself and ruining your own evening by marching up the stairs and locking yourself in your room. Don’t. This is after three whole years! Here’s the fix. Smile, and wait for him to finish his sentence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When he’s done, tell him you’re very sensitive. Look him in the eyes and stare into his soul! Tell him, “Hey, I’m really sensitive. You should stop now”. Nothing will make him go quiet quite like this move. Go for it, and enjoy a solid five minutes of absolute silence from him as a welcome present. Welcome to freedom!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Empathy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1033.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Bills don’t pay themselves but perhaps the worst part about them isn’t that they make your wallet an onion, since it’ll make you cry when you open it up. The worst part is perhaps having to wait in line to pay them. Just as it would ordinarily transpire, you’re at the bank and you’re in a long queue. You know you’re going to waste your whole lunch break today trying to pay this bill, but you got to do what you got to do! It feels like Hell with fluorescent lighting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The whirring of the note-counting machine and then thuds of the stamps that validate payment are drumming in your head. You just want it to end. It’s been thirty minutes now and it’s almost your turn. You prepare the right hand for handing in the bill and the left for paying up the money. You brought the exact amount to save time. It’s finally your turn and you’re so excited you accidentally hand the cashier your money first. Not realizing it isn’t the bill, you draw your hand back and prepare to pay and get out of her. The lady having waited a second too much for you to have realized, raises her gaze and looks at you with not only disgust, but also the disappointment of a father who just got the news his son failed Math again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Only now do you realize the fault is your own, and you rethink screaming at her for being so slow. Own up to it. Apologize. The only way you can diffuse this situation is by doing so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Turn it up&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1034.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock     &lt;p&gt;You love your spouse and feel lucky to have them. It’s just that sometimes, they can hurt you with their words or by doing something of the same nature. You love them too much and you tell yourself they’re never ordinarily this way, which is true. You tell yourself they’re having a hard day and they’ll be fine. Sometimes though, you wish they could be a bit more understanding and not hurt you. There comes a fine limit for everyone, and you feel yours has been reached. This time, you won’t hold back. In fact, you’ll just leave. Serves them right, waking up to no one will do them justice! You plan it all out. But wait, think it through again. Don’t leave someone you love so much helpless and worried. After all, it’s just an episode, right? Convey them the message through some music with fitting lyrics. Let the music tell them you’re worried and that you’re considering leaving, which they will regret heavily. It’ll fix their grumpy mood, guaranteed. So the next time someone tries to bring you down, don’t wrestle them to the ground. Be patient and know one basic thing – if anyone ever tries to bring you down, it’s because you’re above them. Think these tips are helpful and will enable you to become a better person? Let us know!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"6 Nice Things to Say to Mean, Rude People","description":"Rude people.
