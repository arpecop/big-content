The extroverts seem to gain happiness by being out and about, they are mostly the popular lot at your university, those who are social butterflies, easy to make friends and have more contacts in their list than the countries we can count in the world. But then the world also constitutes of the quiet and shy introverts, who like to keep within themselves, enjoying their solitude and finding peace and contentment within themselves. Below are some of the qualities that would let you decide if you are introvert, an extrovert or the best of both worlds, an ambivert!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scroll down to the bottom for the quiz after reading through these pointers!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Do you think things through before you answer?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2192-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Is that a yes, does it mean that you pay attention to detail, and scrutinize each detail before you answer each question? Do you like to think things through carefully rationalizing everything? Maybe you’re the thinker, the one who takes more than thirty seconds to answer everything, due to which you cannot adequately participate in your class discussion. You are the one who likes to plan ahead in life, account for the high and the lows, so you have everything under control and there are no last minute surprises. So you are the one who would like to shake up their frontal cortex, before answering anyone who casually asks you about your future plans next time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or is it a no? Do you believe in no consequences? You are the one who has a happy-go-lucky attitude in life, going with the flow. You do not like to waste your time thinking much about anything, after all you live only once, thus every opportunity is a new way to learn, thus impulsivity is the way to go for you. You do not like to plan for anything in advance, you go on each journey life takes you, taking it as an adventure. You believe in quantity rather than quality. Next time someone asks you about future plans you would like to yell, “chocolates!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Are you the one who often has the last word in a conversation?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2192-2-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Is your answer in affirmative? Are you the one who is the most talkative amongst your friends? You are an avid texter who cannot stay silent for even a whole minute without texting someone about the latest juicy gossip or tales of your daily chronicles? You are the one who is often caught passing chits in a long boring lecture, why keep quiet when you have so many things to share? You get that funny feeling in the stomach if you do not reply to a new message or an email right away and you cannot fathom how you’re friend’s last seen on watsapp was five hours ago when you can barely take your fingers off it. You can’t tolerate those late replies; synonymously you are not the one who can keep a secret for too long. Did bragelina end? Oh that’s so last month!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is your answer a no? Often let all those texts go unnoticed? Let the bing bing of your phone become silenced? You do not seem to like a lot of notifications from social media. Snapchat, facebook, messenger and twitter, they are just not your thing. Sometimes you remain oblivious to the struggles of the younger generation whose last seen is thirty seconds away. Communication is just not your thing, whether its chatting with coworkers or your family after dinner, you would rather spend all that time reading a book or contemplating the secrets of the universe than engage in small talk with you fellow human beings. You do not know the latest celebrity scandals on facebook do you? Last time you saw watsapp was two days ago perhaps? Or even longer who knows for sure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Do you believe in spontaneity as the only philosophy?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2192-3-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Is that a yes? You take every day as it comes. You let the winds sweep you away. Living in the moment is your catchphrase. When is the last time you even spent five minutes thinking what you need to order at a restaurant, by the time your hearty dish was brought by the waiter, your friends were probably researching what to eat. You believe in taking risk. Each failure teaches you something new, and each day the rising sun represents a brand new day. You do not do anything till you love it, practicality is a word that probably has no space in your vocabulary. The past is gone, the future is unknown, but today is a gift, which is why it is known as the present.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So it’s a no? So everything has to be planned before execution. You believe in success by planning for the future. What do you need to study at college, what exact qualifications will earn you which job? You have it all figured out, whether it is when you will marry or how many kids you will have. Each task needs to aligned and completed by the end of each day; you carry one of daily planners as one of your vital possessions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Do you enjoy being alone?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2192-4-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Is your answer yes? Do you like being curled up by the warm fire on dark winter nights, reading a book that will carry you far far away? Prefer spending quality time with your pets? One of your weekend go to plans is a nice movie in a blanket, eating popcorn in bed. You do not like the idea of spending special occasions with a large crowd partying hard, but rather prefer to take a long nap to recharge. Dating people and human interaction is not something you would like to spend time on. You bail on each plan to go out, making up the same excuses, as no one would really buy the idea that you like to spend time alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or is that a no? What good is spending time alone? And how valuable is an achievement when you do not have anyone to celebrate it with? You are the most popular social butterfly at school. Your contact list is larger than all the countries in the world. You know everyone in your neighborhood and make sure everyone knows you. You like to spend your hard earned money at lavish dinners and get together on weekends with friends and co-workers. Family and friends are extremely important, how would one survive without them?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Do you pay attention to detail?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2192-5-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Is that a yes? What was the name of the waiter who served you last? Or when do the kids next door leave each day for school? You have microscopic eyes that can see every little pattern in the universe. You read books with each detail describing your favorite character, so you can make a sketch of him in your mind. You take exactly two teaspoon of sugar in your coffee each day not less no more. Everything for you is precise and calculated. At work, everyone knows they can trust you with the hardest assignment and it will be done to perfection. This habit of yours gains you a lot of compliments often.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Nah? Details just are not your thing. You work on approximation. You’re attention is so divided at a given moment between chatting with your friends, noticing someone new at the table across from you, that you just cannot give time to every tiny little element. You look for the bigger picture in everything. For everything should be looked at as a whole, and not for its constituents. You live big and don’t seem to care much about your daily star bucks latte.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;You rarely get bored absorbing all the information around you?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2192-6-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Yes is your answer? You can quietly spend time alone at a mall; looking at all the people nearby, what they are wearing or what are they conversing about with each other? Are two people having a heated argument? What is the new item on sale, you blissfully note down every piece of information as you take a nice stroll around the mall, in some dusky corners of your brain, neatly tucked away only to be retrieved just when you need it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is it a no? Do bits and pieces of information confuse you as you move along a mall? You don’t want to know everything happening everywhere simultaneously, being alone at a mall or a restaurant is not something you would be caught doing. You get extremely annoyed and bored being all by yourself seeing the world go by.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;You think small talk is a complete waste of time?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2192-7-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Yes one should rather focus on things that need actual attention and keep the conversation to a bare minimum. You are a little socially awkward when it comes to making new friends. Whether it is the new neighbor who just moved in or a new colleague at work you just cannot make the first move. Who cares what is in fashion or the new hot actor everyone seems to be talking about. You are too intellectual to gain in such miserly conversations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Where would one be without small talk? The new show that aired yesterday on national television, that is sweeping everyone off their feet. You do not know those awkward pauses in a conversation, what to talk about next just naturally comes to you. You fluently gauge your way across a conversation, you have your way to make new friends. Everyone loves you and you are stopped frequently on your way to class for a chat or two.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Do you get protective when someone criticizes you?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2192-8-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Yes you are perfect when it comes to everything, so you get defensive when someone tries criticizing a thing or two. Everything you have a work of perfection and there is no room for additional criticism, this may be considered borderline narcissistic by some by it is second nature for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you take criticism without getting defensive? Everything has room for improvement and one must pay heed to constructive criticism to constantly strive for betterment and be successful. So next time someone tells you look better with a bun rather than making a pony tail, you will look twice in the mirror before making one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Are your first impressions of people always correct?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2192-9-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Yes, you seem to know everyone inside out. You can tell by just by the first conversations how long will your friendship last. People are like an open book for you, which you can read easily. Your friends can rely on your opinions when looking for a romantic partner, your judgment is always invaluable and almost a hundred percent accurate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nope, according to you people are much more than just first impressions, you believe in knowing a person for at least a substantial amount of time before you can pass any judgments. You are not so good at reading people, the entire species and understanding humans can be a very daunting task. Thus you almost never rely on first impressions when it comes to people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Do you make each argument supported by solid evidence?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2192-10-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Yes, it takes more than just I saw him doing it, to convict anyone of anything. You work on basis of facts and serious evidence. You like doing your research before forming an opinion, always looking up trusted sources. It’s not a fact till it’s published in the national newspaper or an esteemed scientific journal. You would make an extremely trusted physician or a great police detective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For you, you will believe just about anything, whether you overhear a conversation at work or college or see a latest gossip in a teen magazine. Any evidence will work for you; you function on the basis of your gut-feeling. Evidence is an evidence whether it’s what that unreliable colleague tells you, or a newspaper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;So who are you?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2192-11-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Do you like to think before each answer or ignore your texts till the last day, yes you are introverted. Spontaneous is not your word, enjoy spending all the time alone? You will gladly stare at a distance for hours, absorbing each detail. Small conversations don’t entice you, but you take criticism seriously and you cannot decipher people too well, but hey, your arguments are always centered on solid facts rather than baseless evidence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Impulsivity is a part of your nature; you seem to read people inside out, thus first impressions are everything. Being on your own is not a thing; you party hard and celebrate everything. You do not believe in factual evidence and sometimes tend to get defensive when criticized. Yes you are extroverted. Natural conversationalist and adored by those around you, for you the secret lies in the bigger picture rather than details. You are always quick to reply in all conversations without thinking much, after all you only live once right?&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Here’s the original quiz for you!&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Can You Pass the Gifted Introvert Test?","description":"Do you like your alone time or party hard with friends?
