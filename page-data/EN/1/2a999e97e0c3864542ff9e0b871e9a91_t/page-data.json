Be it over not being street smart, forgetting the way to your school or getting a ‘D’ in Mathematics. There is a reason people say that your grades don’t determine if you are smart or not. Here are some factors that will convince you underestimate your intelligence a bit too much. So grab a paper and pen and start ticking of any of these qualities that might be present in you!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. You have messy handwriting:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1147.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Many years ago, a concept arose about something called a creative disorder. It stated people who were smart had really messy handwriting. It was a way to channel their brain and fuel their desire to be creative.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not only is the handwriting something that’s messy in smart people’s lives, its other aspects too like having a messy room or a messy bag. Next time your mother grounds you for having a messy room tell her it was your creative spirits fault.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. You are a curious person:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1148.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Curious people tend to have a more refined and developed way of thinking. They are always interested in keeping up with the progressive world and are always interested in progressing with it. Intelligent people like gathering information about the global world, always striving for more and more information to feed their brain. Intellectual people are known to invest their time and effort in their intellect even when they aren’t aware they are doing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. You are a night owl:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1149.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Early birds who? Night owls have known to beat the early birds in a study that was carried out in correlation to this subject. We aren’t saying that staying up late just kicks your IQ scores up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What night owls usually do is browse the internet to learn more information while other people are enjoying a goodnight’s sleep. Choosing to read and feed your brain is a sign that you are smarter than you think you are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. You are the oldest child:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1150.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Genetics isn’t the reason the oldest child is the smartest. The reason the oldest children are slightly more successful than the rest of the children are because their IQ is slightly higher than them. We aren’t saying that if you are young you probably aren’t smart but we are saying your oldest sibling is probably smarter than you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. You took music lessons:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1151.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Want some help in improving the grades of your 4-6 year olds? Well studies have shown that children who play musical instruments during an early age are known to score good test results and take a more avid interest in their studies. Music has a tendency to stimulate the brain and increase a child’s verbal intelligence. Learned to play guitar when you were younger? Don’t doubt your intelligence now!&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;5. You loved reading as a child:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1152.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;It takes no rocket science to understand that children who learned to read at an earlier age are more intelligent than the ones who didn’t. These children had much more time to study and analyze and basically get more reading material than the children who started leading later than them. These children are classified as smarter due to them indulging in reading rather than other activities when they were children as reading is good for the mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. You have a slim figure:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1153.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;There is no fat shaming involved here at all. A study that was carried out in 2006 showed that the larger the person’s waist was the lesser their brain was. This is believed to be in a direct correlation to the fact that children who try to do better in terms of education also do their best in terms of looking after their health as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. You have a sense of humor:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1154.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;This might seem like a slightly bizarre condition in a list pointing out intellectual factors of people but it is true. Your sense of humor and your intelligence are connected at a point. What proves this? Glad you asked. 400 psychology students took intelligence tests that measured abstract reasoning abilities and verbal intelligence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then they were asked to come up with captions for several New Yorker cartoons, and those captions were reviewed by independent raters. Any guesses on what were the ratings were? Well smarter students were rated as funnier ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. You aim for perfection:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1155.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Have you been called a perfectionist one too many times? Well don’t take it negatively. It just means you are more intelligent than most. Intelligence isn’t only present in your verbal skills or appearing to be so. Intelligent people are known to try and achieve perfection in all aspects of life. They do their best to be a good speaker, they do their best to look the best and they do their best to score the best. Too much use of the word but if you are a perfectionist it probably echoes in your head more than it does in most peoples. In short they crave perfection in every aspect of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. You are very self-critical:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1156.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Self-critique comes in more ways than just one. It doesn’t always have to be mean and bashing yourself. Intelligent people would know criticizing themselves does not mean that they have low self-esteem or that they are trying to give themselves low self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;These people are known to use their criticism to improve themselves and their lifestyle and increase their intellectual levels. Being able to accept yourself with your flaws instead of brooding over them makes you a smart person not a stupid one. Intelligent people first acknowledge their flaws so that they can improve and eradicate their flaws completely to achieve perfection which was mentioned earlier that is was a part of being an intelligent person.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Signs That You’re Way More Intelligent Than You Realize","description":"Questioning your capabilities?
