It was translated from Arabic by the Middle East Media Research Institute also known by its initials as MEMRI.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1483.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI said to him: How dare you? You have robbed me of my land‚Ä¶ and now you are stealing my folklore and my food, claiming that this is your Jewish food? This is our food, the food of the Palestinian people, I won‚Äôt allow this,‚Äù¬†Manuel Hassanain blasted the Israeli student at the time of the incident.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He went on to add that the Israeli was unapologetic about it and remained defiant that what he was presenting was authentic Israeli food. A young man of only 20 at the time Hassanain decided to teach the Israeli a lesson about cultural appropriation by beating him up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People were quick to call campus security and they broke up the fight and took him away. The authorities then inquired as to the reason of the violence. He claims that upon learning the cause of his outburst that he did it because the Israeli was appropriating Palestinian and Arab culture with impunity, the authorities let him go and even told him that he had done the right thing and that his country and people should be proud of him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Palestinian Authority envoy to the United Kingdom went on to add that Palestine was completely Arab and that Israeli occupation is responsible for re writing the history of Palestine as a Jewish land instead of an Arab area. He went on to say that Jews were never a part of the historical fabric of the Holy City of Jerusalem and that Israelis had come and colonized the area under the alias of being settlers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Balfour declaration in which the government of the United Kingdom stated that they would help the Jews carve out a homeland for themselves out of the historical region of Palestine. Palestinians claim that the declaration and its implementation in the decades afterwards led to the destabilization of the Middle East and the uprooting of millions of Palestinians.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Palestinians and other who oppose the occupation have said that they want the British government to issue an official apology for the Balfour declaration which they say led to the settlement of an alien people from far off lands on their territory and displacement of millions of Palestinians and forced them into neighboring Arab countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Palestinians refer to the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 as the Nakba which in Arabic means the catastrophe, Indeed it was a catastrophe as people were forced out in droves and never allowed to return. In this process 78 percent of historical Palestine became the new state of Israel. What little was left was taken in the 1967 six day war. The Israelis continue to hold the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza strip which are all officially recognized as occupied land under international law.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;The Israeli Palestinian peace process seems to be dead in the water and one can only hope that things change for the better.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Palestinian Arab Admits Assaulting an Israeli over Falafel","description":"An official from the Palestinian Authority admitted to having beat up an Israeli over falafel.
