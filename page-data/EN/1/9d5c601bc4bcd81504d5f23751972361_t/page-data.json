The bear comes, sniffs around the guy, (thinks the guy is dead) and goes away into the forest. The friend on the top sees that the bear has gone away and climbs down towards the guy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This right there is a one in a million probability that the bear won’t stick around for the main course. Whenever you encounter a bear, know the difference.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Grizzly Bear (Big brown Guy) approaches you or charges you, hold your ground and when it makes contact drop down, cover yourself, and play dead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Black Bear would most definitely attack if it sees its prey drop down and pretending to be dead. If you ever come across a similar creature, try to startle it by pounding your feet with the ground. And if that doesn’t work, run to safety or climb up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. Boiling Water Will Make It Clean&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1182.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Yes and No. Sure, boiling any liquid has proven to be helpful in killing bacteria and germs. But No. If you’re stuck somewhere and are dehydrated, then you probably would come across water that has mud or muck in it. Boiling water would not be able to get rid of these materials. First filter the water through a fabric and then boil it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. You’re Stranded in a Desert, So You Need To Find Water&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1183.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Conserve what you have, look for shelters in the day and journey at dusk. Many survivalists have agreed upon the fact that acting out of fear will not be helpful if you are dehydrating. Some people have died of thirst after only 4 hours of taxing their body to find water, while others have survived 2 days by conserving what they already have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. You’re Stranded in a Forest, So You Need To Find Food.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1184.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Do not eat the food you find in the forest. The important thing for you is to find shelter and a supply of water&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. You Only Need Two sticks to Make Fire.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1185.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;This is another myth that you should be aware of. No, you cannot ignite fire with two sticks. What if, it rained, and the wood is wet. What you should do is equip yourself with special matches or a lighter and a survival kit too. (Pocket knife, band aids, ointments, and the usual tools). Look for some dry wood, make a pile of it, dig a little hole in the ground, stock the wood over it and ignite.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. If You Are Pierced By an Object, Pull It Out&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1186.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;This one is definitely a super nope. Whenever you’re pierced with a shard or an object, DO NOT PULL IT OUT. I know it hurts but removing the piece would cause massive blood loss and its better to stay alive and wait out the pain than to do something impulsive. Tie a rope or cloth or a tourniquet tightly across the wound till it actually hurts to tight (pain level 5-6) to slow the bleeding. Note the time that you applied this trick, the medics will find this information useful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Build a Roof, Not a Bed.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1187.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;When Building a shelter, make a bed higher than the ground so that you’re protected from the land creatures. And after that, make a roof. You need to protect yourself from the ground, not the sky.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;9. Put the person in a hot tub, if they’ve been a victim of Hypothermia&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1188.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Never scrub the frostbitten areas as this may cause further tissue damage. You also shouldn’t use hot water or a heating lamp to warm the person. Treatment like this may end up triggering shock to the victim’s body. Instead, you should warm the person’s core up gradually, preferably with blankets and some warm water bottles under their armpits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. If there is an Earthquake, stand under a Doorway.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1189.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Do Not Do That. Yes, the ground is shaking bit you need to get out of the building to a clear place.as soon as possible. Standing under a door way might be fatal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Eating Wild Plants is Safe.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1190.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Wild roots, herbs, berries, mushrooms are unsafe to consume as they might be toxic to your system. Have a light snack along with you like an energy bar to keep you going&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6.-Moss Grows on North Side of the tree.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1191.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Moss Grows on all sides of trees, so it might not be the way to know your way around. Carry a compass.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. You Can Drink From A Cactus.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1192.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Only a certain species of cactus can provide safe drinking water. The rest have fluids that are toxic for your system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. If it is cold on the valley floor, move to a higher ground.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1193.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Not a bright idea. It gets colder, the higher you go. Conserve your internal heat as long as you can or make a shelter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. If you’re Caught in a Rip Current, Always swim parallel&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1194.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Not all Rip currents can be escaped by swimming parallel. Some are longshore and some are diagonal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trick is to swim perpendicular to the current. If you’re going upstream, you’re going the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. You Can Outrun a Bear&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1195.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;No, you cannot out run a bear. Climb up to a tree or a point where the bear can’t reach you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. If a snake bites you, Suck the Venom Out.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1196.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Wash the wound, apply basic ointment and try to get to a hospital as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-Survival is knowing About What To Do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Survival is not as easy as it is presumed to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Watching survival shows might not be helpful as they are heavily scripted and have the necessary security and medic aid as well.It is sometimes, a result of series of misfortunate circumstances and the best way to evade any situation is to&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-STAY CALM.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-Know Your Environment&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-Carry a safety Kit&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-be physically and mentally prepared.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;-Don’t Make Impulsive Decisions&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"15 Survival Myths That Could Actually Hurt You","description":"A Black Bear would most definitely attack if it sees its prey drop down"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/1/9d5c601bc4bcd81504d5f23751972361_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/1/a10b3576761aa9f80217f48d7aba0591_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Three Important Precautions to Survive a Nuclear Attack"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/1/9aed19ad152d1823b658bf215876b3e1_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"The Story of Homeless Johnny Shows Why All People Deserve a Safe Home"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
