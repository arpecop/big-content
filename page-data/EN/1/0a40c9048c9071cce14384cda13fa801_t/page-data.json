Having you back under constant check can be quite a tough situation to be in. The timings to eat, go out, exercise are all under the strict guidance can be really gruesome and one would never ever to be in this situation. Let’s explore the following list which takes us through one of the most stupid prison escapes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. The story of James Russell&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1092.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;He was in the Olympic correction center in Washington and was not happy with his confinement. Russell decided to get out of this facility with the help of the smartphone and did manage it all successfully. The only issue which landed him back in jail was the fact that he did not go too far after his escape. He just knocked on the first door he came across and ended up being caught by the police again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Ken Adverto&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1093.jpeg&quot;/&gt;/i.ytimg.com &lt;p&gt;He tried to escape the prison by impersonating someone else. But little did he knew that the person he was choosing to impersonate was black and he himself was white. The black man was supposed to be released after signing the property papers. Ken did it himself and while the police was escorting him out the officer in charge noticed a discrepancy as he knew the person who was supposed to be released. So as a result of that Ken ended up in facing two charges.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Andrew Joseph Wilson&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1094.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Wilson was facing charges of twenty days when he attempted burglary and just 24 hours before his bail he did the dumbest thing ever done. He tried to escape the prison in a van after signing fake release bills but was soon caught and was had to serve more time in prison then the first time. Impatience got the best of him which resulted in more time being jailed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Brazilian guy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1095.jpeg&quot;/&gt;vyperlook &lt;p&gt;Not only you might find dumbest prisoners in America but they can be found all across the globe. This guy in Brazil ended up getting stuck in a hole which was his escape. Because he was healthy and the hole was small he ended up being hurt and had to call for help. The guards who came for rescue could not hold back their smiles and ended up making photos of him stuck in this way. Seems like somebody did not do their homework well or are not feasible to escape the prison!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Movie inspired escape&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1096.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Twitter &lt;p&gt;How many of us relate to the movies in our real life. I am sure many of us would be feeling like that we are the heroes and heroines of a certain movie! So this guy in Brazil was exactly thinking the same when he watched the movie Shaw shank redemption. This movie was about a group of prisoners who ended up finding an escape out of the prison. Tim Roberts the main lead ultimately found an escape by digging through the hole and getting released. The guy thought that he was also smart like Robert and dug a hole which was just under that of the toilet. He was partially successful but when he tried to get out of the toilet he found that the pipe was clogged there and ended up getting stuck in the toilet dirt. Sounds like someone got in deep crap!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. William Alviz&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1097.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Tired of working in the prison kitchen William thought that he would be able to lower his sentence. He decided to lower himself in the dustbin and hide amongst the trash so he could be dumped in the street. All was going well except that when the man who was supposed to dump the garbage picked it up he found something really heavy since William was quite a huge man. When investigated the dumper found out that there was a man hiding inside the trash bin.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;6. Luwak tucker prison&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1098.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Seems like movies impact us a lot nowadays. So these prisoners also got inspired by a movie and planned the escape by tying bed sheets along the sanitary pipes. The bed sheets did not seem to last long and failed them miserably!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Christopher Cornelius and Mathews Johnson&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1099.jpeg&quot;/&gt;storypick &lt;p&gt;Both of these guys thought that they were like Spiderman and would be able to leave the jail through his ways. So when they managed to go down the roof with the poorly tied up bed sheets Christopher fell down. Since the fall was of 20 feet he ended up hurting his back bone and ankle resulting in being hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Beed county jail&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1100.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The inmates in the jail thought that the best and easiest way to leave the bars would be to fight their way out. This was because since the doors were electrically locked and the windows could not be broken. They managed to do that while the cell check was being carried out at 2.am in the morning. The prisoners managed to escape only to find out that they could only make it to the visitor’s area when they got surrounded by a large army of guards carrying guns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Ralph Wilson&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1101.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;So this guy thought that he would be able to escape in the daylight! He even attempted to cross one wired wall and was noticed by the officers who were carrying out the evening recreational activities. After that one wall he was attempting to go over the other two containing razor sharp wires and was thinking of attaining that freedom. Very smart of him *winks*&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Escaping through flying&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1102.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;So this particular 51 year old drug trafficker had the most dramatic escape. Inspired by the movie the last crusade where Indiana Jones flew to independence. His friends set up a camp which had motion sensors 400 miles away from the jail in order to monitor the control of the guards which would make the escape easier. After the monitoring was done they set up a camouflaged remote controlled zeppelin and managed to bring it to the facility so the prisoner would manage his escape. The problem arose and it got noticed by the staff since it was very huge. Not only the man was arrested but his accomplices were arrested too. And this man was already serving a term because of smuggling 400 tons of cocaine to another destination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Serial killer escapes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1103.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikimedia     &lt;p&gt;Yes so this escape is of Bundy the serial killer who terrorized US in the late 1970s. Being a smart guy he decided to present his own case denying the right to attorney. Since he was presenting his own case he was excused from wearing restraints so that he could move around the Courtroom freely. Moreover during the break he was also given an opportunity to visit the court room library in order to revisit the books. He managed to escape from there. The story does not end here and six months later he was caught again and charged. This time he tried to play smart and dug out an escape through the cell’s ceiling. Bad luck got the better of him because it ended up in the house of the chief jailer who was luckily away for a date night. Bundy changed in his clothes and tried to escape. He later confessed that he wanted to live a healthy life and stop being a serial killer. But this wish could not be materialized and he continued with the crime so was jailed again the grilling was intense this time!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"12 Dumbest Prison Escape Attempts Ever","description":"We all wish to be free some prisoners took matters into their own hands and tried to break out in some hilarious ways."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/1/0a40c9048c9071cce14384cda13fa801_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/1/12937963b6c9f4f7294731da80a21df1_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"A Fascinating Look at the Stars of Harry Potter 16 Years Later"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/1/07a0005ca1e5cb9e66279425fb318fe1_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"13 MYTHS THAT IT's SHAMEFUL to BELIEVE In"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
