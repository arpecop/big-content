She has a strong personality with matching intelligence which endears her to the millions of her fans. She has certain principles on which she stand and there is a certainty in her actions off-screen which suggest confidence and determination. It is no surprise really if she continued her successful celebrity image for years to come as she is already amongst the highest paid actresses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite establishing all these facts, every celebrity has certain aspects of their past they would rather not talk about. Few of these skeletons in her closet are discussed below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Very dramatic divorce&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; #scarlettjohansson #rare #photoshoot #dressedinblack #elegant #youngerscarlett #oldlady #actress&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  FANPAGE (@scarlettmazing) on Apr 5, 2013 at 10:38am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scarlett kept her private life so well protected that nobody knew she was married to Romain Dauriac until after they got divorced. The way they both parted ways was really messy as both fought over the custody of their daughter Dorothy Rose with her ex-husband pushing for full time custody. He cited the reason that Johansson is too international and always travelling which is not good for her daughter and he wanted to raise her in France, his hometown. However they both have come to some sort of private deal as to the parenting of their child.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. She is considered a player in Hollywood&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Omg I&#39;m so horrible at posting on time‚Ä¶ üòÇ Oh well at least you guys get a spam of 3 photos all at once everyday for the &amp;quot;birthday countdown&amp;quot; üòú&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  Scarlett Johansson (@seriouslyscarlett) on Nov 17, 2017 at 4:27pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As she is divorced and single she is seen as a bit of a player juggling the field with several dates at one time. She does not mind the prying eye of media and just focus on having a good time with fellow celebrities. According to some rumors she was seen with celebrity chef Bobby Flay and after few minutes having dinner with SNL star Colin Jost. So yeah she does not care about the media or the way it interferes with private lie of celebrities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Controversial role&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; She&#39;s come to slay. #natasharomanoff #blackwidow&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  Scarlett Johansson (@seriouslyscarlett) on Nov 27, 2017 at 3:37pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to some media reports the movie Ghost in the Shell actually asked for an Asian women as the protagonist and Johansson was given the role instead. Many fans of Asian descent raised a lot of hue and cry over the matter. Despite these controversies Scarlett Johansson made it very clear that she is all for diversity especially in Hollywood. She further added that it is not very often that female protagonist roles are offered in the movies and she saw this role as an opportunity to show the talents of female stars in the movies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. She is very particular about the kind of role she want to act&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; M O O D&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  Scarlett Johansson (@seriouslyscarlett) on Nov 16, 2017 at 1:20pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It would not be accurate to assume that Scarlett Johansson never did a flop film since all Hollywood actors do usually end up casting themselves in a venture which is not at all well-received. However apart from her box-office winners like The Avengers and Lost in Translation she has also done some great work in movies like Vicky Christina Barcelona and The Black Dahlia. According to her there should be some chemistry on screen and one must be comfortable with their role and feel in tuned to the script in order to really put on a riveting performance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. She had an unsuccessful music career&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; #scarlettjohansson #youngerscarlett #beautiful #gorgeous&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  Scarlett/ladiesofhollywood76 (@scarlettpinup76) on Dec 7, 2017 at 9:03am PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;What most of her fans don‚Äôt know is her love for creating music and singing and she did tried her luck with music industry. She first made a performance in Coachella in 2007 and that same year starred in Justin Timberlake‚Äôs music video ‚ÄúWhat goes around Comes around‚Äù. She even did some collaboration with British singer Pete Yorn but unfortunately it was not met with much enthusiasm. The music producers were of the view that she has a melodious voice but the fans would rather see her on the big screen than associate her with music.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"15 Things About Her past Scarlett Johansson Wants to Hide","description":"Scarlett Johansson is without any doubt one of the most versatile A-list actress one could ask for in Hollywood.
