Joli is an island girl originally hailing from the outskirts of Manila, Philippines. They lived almost 8000 miles apart from each other and met each other over a traveller’s meet up at Cebu City, Philippines in 2010.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They both started online exchange of messages and communication simply took off between them. After three years of online messaging they finally started their long distance relationship.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; 📍 Boracay Island, Philippines Golden hour on Boracay, one of our favorite beaches on earth, with some of the nicest sand we&#39;ve ever been on ❤ . . So looks like our story is really going viral right now and we&#39;re really just starting to process it all. 😮😮😮 It started picking up right around Thanksgiving when we were busy catching up with family and friends…and now it&#39;s really all over the place. Exciting times ahead! . . Speaking of Thanksgiving, we are grateful all for our followers both old and new! You guys rock! 🙂 We just love sharing travel tips and ideas with people (we&#39;re cuckoo like that) and we thank you for being on this crazyyy journey with us! . . . #visitphilippines #itsmorefuninthephilippines #instapilipinas #boracay #beach #dipkiss #dipkisstravels&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Dipkiss Travels ✈️ (@dipkisstravels) on Nov 27, 2017 at 9:31pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since they lived so far away they had to plan out a way of meeting each other that would incorporate their mutual love for travelling and photography as well. They would meet each other in different parts of the world and to make their reunion a memory to be cherished for long they made a tradition of ‘dip kissing’ at the famous and beautiful parts of the world they met each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the couple’s own blog, Dipkiss Travels, they saw the trend of everyone taking jump shots so they came up with this exclusive ‘signature pose’ which was original to them and heartfelt by both.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; 📍 Grandfather Mountain, NC, USA . Probably one of the highest points where we had a dipkiss at 5,945 feet or 1,812 meters. Yeah, we&#39;re pretty crazy to do it up there, but once we saw the view, we couldn&#39;t help do it! 🙂 . . We just had an amazing Thanksgiving surrounded by family and friends this weekend. We even got up the family Christmss tree, perhaps we&#39;ll post some pictures on our Instagram stories. How was your weekend? 🙂 . . #visitnorthcarolina #nc #grandfathermountain #dipkiss #dipkisstravels #wanderlust #travel&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Dipkiss Travels ✈️ (@dipkisstravels) on Nov 26, 2017 at 3:05pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was whimsical, romantic and something which was completely done by the couple to make ever lasting memories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Little did they know that their collection of pictures will have a huge response from the rest of the world as it was something so special and sweet it served as an inspiration for many long distance lovers.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; “For every church in Rome, there’s a bank in Milan!” Well, at least that’s what a famous Italian saying claims. 🙂 If Rome is all about history, then Milan is all about the future… Have any of you been to Milan? We were lucky enough to visit on our last trip to Italy–but only for one day! It sucks to have so little time there. Still, we felt like we really made the most out of it… ❤ Want to know how we did it?

The response was immediately positive since they got almost 5000 followers since posting those pictures on their instagram page.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; 📍Obidos, Portugal What a beautiful little medieval town with some of the best ginja that Portugal has to offer ❤ We were so addicted to it, we walked from block to block trying all of their ginja cherry liqeur, served in chocolate cups 🙂 Simply divine!!! . . #visitportugal #obidos #dipkiss #dipkisstravels #wanderlust&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Dipkiss Travels ✈️ (@dipkisstravels) on Nov 24, 2017 at 11:03pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This travelling and tradition of ‘Dipkiss’ suited both of them perfectly fine since both would have something to look forward to apart from their work routine. It was not only a way to unwind but connect with the other person physically and immortalizing the memory with the camera.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rob works as an engineer and Joli is a ‘corporate communications specialist’. This is the reason their blog’s written content is managed by her while Rob provides the pictorial content.&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt; Dhow Cruise in Dubai 🙂 ❤ . . #dipkiss #dipkisstravels&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Dipkiss Travels ✈️ (@dipkisstravels) on Nov 9, 2017 at 8:10pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One may wonder how is it possible for two professionals to find the time and money required to do so much travelling. The couple explained that it really took some planning and saving. They also scheduled their trips with paid leaves hence successfully catered to their hobbies as well as not being affected economically by the excessive travelling involved.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Vast, rugged, wild and vibrant — these are just some of the words that come to mind for those who encounter this iconic region on the Utah and Arizona border . . Can&#39;t help but be in an awe of the stunning natural hues in this red sand desert. ❤ . And thanks to John Wayne&#39;s Westerns, it has become the epitome of what the American West looks like to the outside world. 🐎 . #visitutah #utah #wanderlust #thestreetograph #igersutah #monumentvalley #arizona #visitarizona #dipkisstravels&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Dipkiss Travels ✈️ (@dipkisstravels) on Nov 6, 2017 at 2:47am PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Their love for travel&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The couple explains their wanderlust quite simply because of their curiosity to explore different places.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To sightsee the diverse planet and come across different cultures and different people. It not only exposes you to different experiences but also make you realize how your culture and way of life differs from others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although there is diversity which should be celebrated and explored, at the end of the day we are all human beings and need to realize that these differences are only there to identify us with a certain region.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; From one of our most recent trips in July this year 🇵🇹 . . There is just something so romantic and charming about the European continent, most especially the Iberian peninsula–Spain &amp;amp; Portugal. ❤ . . Despite not being as traditionally popular as other European cities such as Paris or London, it seems Lisbon has slowly done a 360* and become the trendiest capital in #Europe. And on our visit, we totally saw why–it&#39;s a city loaded with a long history, unique charm, friendly people, delicious food and vibrant nightlife. . .

After all many natural resources are destroyed on the pretext of urban development.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This not only is depriving the future generations to enjoy those historically beautiful natural sites but also contributing to the increasing pollution associated with excessive urbanization.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Looking out at the world from above and admiring all the fall colors at the highest point in West Virginia. 🍁🍂🍃 #fallcolors #westvirginia #mountaineers #dipkisstravels #wanderlust&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Dipkiss Travels ✈️ (@dipkisstravels) on Nov 5, 2017 at 12:18am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After two years of travelling and meeting up in different countries Rob proposed to Joli at Moscow, Russia. They both tied the knot this year in June in front of friends and family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Dipkiss Travels&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The couple didn’t anticipate the resulting reaction of their fans. They were simply happy to be a source of inspiration for other long distance couples. It was uplifting for them to learn how they empowered other couples to come forward with their long distance romance stories.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Tracing Forrest Gump&#39;s footsteps and sneaking a kiss in between all our running 🖒 P.S. This place is so otherwordly and magical, straight out of a country western postcard 🙂 #utah #arizona #monumentvalley #forrestgump #dipkisstravels #wanderlust #visitutah #visitarizona #dipkiss&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Dipkiss Travels ✈️ (@dipkisstravels) on Nov 5, 2017 at 12:16am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;They have planned to go to Alaska, Mexico and South Africa as their next destinations in this journey which now is a celebrated trail of inspiration for other couples. Their story of adventurous travels is a way for other couples to weave their own tales around their interests instead of succumbing to the geographical limitations and difficulties between them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Couple Living 8,000 Miles Apart Keep Meeting Halfway for 3 Years to Take the Same Adorable Picture but Then He Decides to Change Things Up","description":"After three years of online messaging they finally started their long distance relationship."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/1/e670e2ac3c588beb7161ca8eff1156c1_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/2/09789512281324883cfc3c1e17af48e2_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"6 Movies Where the Romance Was So Beautiful We Wished It to Be More Than a Fantasy"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/1/e356f30f8f8f879e83729e03470c1361_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Hockey Coach Gives Kids Outrageously Obscene Pep Talk, Gets Canned"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
