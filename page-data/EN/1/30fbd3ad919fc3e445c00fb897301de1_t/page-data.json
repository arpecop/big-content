It does not care how handsome you are, how wealthy you are or how strong you are. When it comes, it comes without warning and takes every single piece of you away in a blink of an eye. According to the biologists death is ” The cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living organism ” they further add that it may occur due to different causes, for instance aging or homicide and so on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if you really want to know about death. Ask someone who has lost someone close or someone who has almost experienced the taste of it. They might tell you different. It is very easy to talk about death but suddenly everything changes when you lose someone, when you feel death’s presence right beside you. It is always a sad phenomena. However the means should be. But when it strikes someone prematurely, when he or she is experiencing the best of life. It becomes unbearable and takes with it some of the others as well and if the lost ones happen to be children, the event becomes unforgettable. Unfortunately, Raymond and Rachael Villasenor had to experience just this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-738.jpeg&quot;/&gt;dignitymemorial &lt;p&gt;On the Monday evening of August 9 2010, a SUV was travelling down Koester Road towards Ladson Road when the vehicle left the roadway. Police say it appears the driver overcorrected and eventually collided with several trees. The coroner later revealed the identity of the driver.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His name was Joseph Villasenor. Joseph was born October 23, 1974 in Carmichael, California to Raymond and Rachel Villasenor. Joseph enlisted in the United States Air Force February 16, 1994 and proudly and so dedicatedly served the United States Air Force for sixteen years. Joseph loved fishing, camping, playing racquet ball, basketball but loved playing softball more than any other sport. He had been chosen to pitch for the Charleston Air Force Base Air Force softball League in Charleston, South Carolina and was on his way to a game when God called him home. His parents Raymond and Rachael were dumb-struck by this untimely death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was only 36 when he embraced the cruel and cold blooded death. Funeral Mass for Joseph Anthony Villasenor was held Monday, August 16, 2010 at 9:00am in St. Joseph Catholic Church of New Waverly with Father Daokim Nguyen officiating and Mass of Christian burial was followed in Garden Park Cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-739.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Jake Reissig &lt;p&gt;“We send our sincerest sympathy and condolences to the family and friends of the Airman who died in today’s car crash,” said Col. John Wood, 437th Airlift Wing commander. “Any time Team Charleston loses one of it’s own, it’s felt throughout the entire community here at Charleston AFB.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His parents visited his grave every other day for having some closure. When one day, they visited Joseph’s grave after some time, they witnessed something harmonious but rather strange. The grass on Joseph’s grave was bright green and lush, while the other graves beside it were completely brown. It was quite a sight and both the people could not manage to utter a word. The only possible explanation they could imagine was ‘ Divine Intervention ‘. But when they learned the truth, they could not stop the flow of tears.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A man called Jake, 86, had recently lost his wife and was at the cemetery to put flowers on his wife’s grave when he saw a young woman in tears. Jake could not help but approach her to comfort her. She turned out to be Joseph’s sister. She told Jake that she could not help but cry as her brother had been taken too soon. Jake comforted her but the news made himself sad too. He thought of Joseph for some time, imagined what it would feel if he lost his children. So when he left the cemetery, he was determined; he had promised himself to do something for Joseph. Jake visited her wife’s grave daily and it had become his routine to water it. He wanted her grave to look beautiful and full of life. Now he would do the same thing for Joseph’s grave. That is exactly why Joseph’s parents were surprised to see his grave so green and alive. When they finally came to know the truth. They could not help but embrace the old man. Jake was shocked to see them so happy.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;It was not huge deed that Jake did. He was already doing the job for one grave so it was not much of deal for him to do another. But it meant a great deal to the unfortunate parents. You see, it does not take to be a superhero for making world happier. We, with little and simple deeds , can make this world a much better place. We all have some kind of superhero in ourselves if we could just realize.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Mom Couldn'T Understand Why Son's Grave Was Green When the Truth Is Revealed, She Can'T","description":"Mother of a fallen soldier found out why her son’s grave was so green, and she just couldn’t stop crying."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/1/30fbd3ad919fc3e445c00fb897301de1_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/1/3b4b1c0d6dfa9b3e6e597172385b2d21_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Disturbing Paranormal Events That Can't Be Explained"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/1/30d6b45945b4ea0291f1f9649aae3531_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"A Woman Just Became Pregnant While ALREADY Pregnant"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
