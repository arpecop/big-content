Albeit not too harmful, certain marks can be clear indications as to what’s going on inside your body and if there’s something that needs catering to in particular. With impurities and pollution on the rise today more than ever before, premature aging of the skin, milk spots, dark spots and outbreaks are all too common. Let’s face it – we’ve all spend a lot of money trying to treat our skin, but often to little or no avail! No need to worry though, we’ve got you covered!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: None of the remedies are intended to cure or prevent disease or disfiguration and we do not recommend you trying out any of these tips on babies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Lemon juice&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-459.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;When life gives you lemons, use them to treat your skin! Sour and tangy lemons make it to our list first and foremost because of their many amazing qualities for skin. Lemon juice is acidic and has organic bleaching properties, which are excellent for treating any discoloration from your skin. Just squeeze some lemon juice into a clear container and use cotton balls or Q-tips to work this elixir into the milk spots or dark spots, as is the situation. Repeat often for best results, but be careful not to overdo it, since lemon juice, as we’ve already discussed, is acidic and can sting. Try out little by little before increasing the concentration! You’ll be glad you did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Aloe Vera&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-460.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;What has long, green spiky leaves that can do wonders to your skin? If your answer is aloe vera, we have a winner! The gel of the aloe vera plant is packed with goodies like vitamins, namely A, C and E, as well anti-oxidants and natural moisturizers for the skin. There’s good reason why most skin products are aloe vera based! From brightening your complexion to catalyzing the shedding and recovery process of your skin, there’s no benefits this plant is short on. Though pure extract is easily available at your favorite departmental store, it’s preferable to use the gel straight from the plant. Just break off a leaf, scoop out the gel, and use it as you would a moisturizer. Voila!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. The Sauna&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-461.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The steam engine may be long gone, but don’t underestimate the power of boiled water! Steam helps unclog your pores and clear your sinuses, but it also does a number of unwanted marks on your skin, which is all the more welcome! Especially true for milk spots, which are those pesky white bumps on your skin, a session at the sauna will make you feeling refreshed and energized, and you can simply rub off the marks when you’re out of the steam room. Pretty good for just plain water, isn’t it? Reminds us of the time we once tried to catch it with our hands. Mist! (Pun intended).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Sun protection&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-462.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;While we’re not going to step in the way of you reaching your tanning goals or a fun day at the beach, if marks on your skin trouble you, you might want to reconsider those sand castles. The thing about the sun is, though we have to thank it in a million ways for sustaining life as we know it, the UV rays are very harmful for skin in prolonged exposure. Too much sun can actually proliferate these marks and make them much harder to remove even with these awesome remedies we bring you, so either time yourself, wear a large-brimmed hat to save your face, or have sun block with adequate SPF power on you. Literally. On you. Your face – you get it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Buttermilk or yogurt&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-463.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;There’s more than a fried chicken batter that buttermilk can cater to, and boy would you be glad. Milk in its many forms has long been established to be super helpful for skin, since milk itself and these products especially, are packed with lactic acid which helps exfoliate and rejuvenate. Just work some buttermilk into your skin and leave it there like a mask for about twenty minutes or so, and rinse it all out. Say goodbye to those marks and hello to smoother, lighter and softer skin!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Honey&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-464.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Oh honey and its golden goodness.

Cornstarch and vinegar&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-465.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;If speed is your thing and time is of the essence, this is a surefire way of helping you bid farewell to any discolorations in your skin, especially if milk spots are your concern.
