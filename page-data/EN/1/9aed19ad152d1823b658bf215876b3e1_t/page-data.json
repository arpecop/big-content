But this guy&#39;s…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Posted by Johnny Servantez on Saturday, September 23, 2017&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While people continue to grow richer, inequality is also widening and the number of homeless continues to balloon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Johnny Rhoades was a desperately poor and malnourished man who sat outside the flea market in the great city of Indianapolis, Illinois. The man extremely malnourished and lay by the road side an image that would remind one of the depths of drought stricken Sub Saharan Africa rather than right here in the richest and most powerful country on the planet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The image was shared on social media and quickly went viral as people were left stunned as to how such a thing could happen in the United States. Donations for the homeless man began to pour in from concerned members of the local community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m so sick to my stomach right now,” said the homeless Danny Rhodes brother. Danny and his brother were not close and had not been in touch ever since their mother passed away. Both the brothers had not seen each for about seven years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Danny Rhodes brother saw the pictures on social media he wanted to help his brother and was determined to scout him out. However when he went looking Danny was nowhere to be found. Johnny had left his usual spot and nobody knew where he had gone to or why.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1418.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Thankfully members of the local community stepped up to help. Ever since the pictures first emerged on social media many members of the local community found out about Danny and his miserable condition. Amy Renae Smith, who was a friend of the Rhodes family decided to go online and made a page asking people if they had any information on Danny and where he was.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eventually, the effort succeeded and the two Rhodes brothers were finally reunited after several years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He had two meals, a shower, a pair of clean clothes, a room to himself with quiet, a king size bed, tv, fridge, a microwave, Pepsi, &amp;amp; leftovers,”  Amy Renae Smith told local media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Food, clothing and shelter are basic human needs and the fact that even in a country as rich as the United States is unable to live up to its commitments to its citizens is deeply saddening. Nobody should have to live such a miserable life on the streets as Danny Rhodes has had to but unfortunately the powers that be are not concerned about those society is leaving behind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many people are not even counted by authorities who are tasked with dealing with homelessness. The official figures regarding homelessness in the United States do not paint an accurate picture of the situations. In reality there are no reliable figures regarding people who do not have a roof over their heads and must live under the open sky.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The latest figures we have on homelessness suggest that on random night there were a total of 549,928 people who did not have a roof over their heads. It can safely be assumed however that the true figure is much higher as those tasked with counting the number of homeless have been known to miss many people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That study was several years old and it is believed that the total number of homeless people has gone over the years. The problem is most acute in the western United States in comparison to other regions such as the south and east of the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem is worst in those cities where prices of real estate have gone up the most. The cities of Portland and Seattle have both declared a state of emergency with regards to housing. Other cities on the west coast such as Los Angeles are not doing much better either and the number of homeless continues to remain high.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;The federal government and state governments should all take notice and try to give a helping hand to the homeless who still have to live in such intolerable conditions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"The Story of Homeless Johnny Shows Why All People Deserve a Safe Home","description":"Johnny Rhoades was a desperately poor and malnourished man who sat outside the flea market in the great city of Indianapolis, Illinois.
