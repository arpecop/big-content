F**k their wives!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A coach wanted to motivate his team and in order to get them fired up he just went overboard. Now he has been fired from his job as a voluntary assistant coach in the town of Littletown Colorado.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now of course using curse words in order to motivate one’s own side to better is as ancient as human competiveness be it in war or in sports a curse word here or there has been standard practice for a very long time. However, a youth hockey coach from Littletown, Colorado has taken things to the next level. The coach whose name has not been revealed was fired after a video of him firing up the spirits of his team of teenage hockey players, surfaced on social media. The news quickly spread and several news outlets took up the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The video which has since garnered more than one hundred and thirty six thousand views, shows that the pre-teen players are giggling and enjoying the rant by their coach who starts off normally enough before going unhinged and all guns blazing against the opposing team. “I don’t care about none of them,” the coach continued. “We’re going to beat ‘em up so bad … Let’s go!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the first sites to take up the story was Deadspin, which posted the video clip online. It is almost unreal how the coach all of a sudden gets unhinged and goes berserk. Before a game on October 6th, the assistant coach started to yell at his players of the Bantam A. Black Under 14 hockey team of the Littleton Hockey Association from the state of Colorado.   “I want to see you sticking your hands up these guys’ asses and working ’em like a fucking puppet!”&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/c-users-ammar-ahmed-downloads-16-11-2858-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;That however was not the end of it and he went on to yell about the team they were playing against and said “And then you’re going to beat ‘em three-none!’” and then went on to say “I want to see you beat up Green Mountain. Fuck Green Mountain! Fuck their coaches! Fuck their wives! Fuck their friends!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After some people told him that he was loud and that people in other rooms could easily hear him the assistant coach just simply shrugged it off and simply said “I don’t care.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rant is as shocking as it is obscene and we can only imagine how horrified the parents of the children listening to this would be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a report cited in the Denver Post USA Hockey complained about the behavior of the coach to the league and that is how the league found about the actions of the over enthusiastic coach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This unfortunate event is not a representation of our association and out of respect for the families and the sport we are diligently working to correct the situation,” George Stieduhar who is also the league president said in a statement to the local CBS affiliate in Denver, Colorado. Furthermore; the Littletown Hockey Association sent out an email to distraught parents and said that they apologies for the “inappropriate language” that can be heard in the video which has since gone viral. The email further went on to say “He was very embarrassed and issued a letter of apology to the opposing team and apologized to his team,”&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;According to the local CBS affiliate the coach has also tendered an apology to both of the teams.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Hockey Coach Gives Kids Outrageously Obscene Pep Talk, Gets Canned","description":"A coach wanted to motivate his team and in order to get them fired up he just went overboard"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/1/e356f30f8f8f879e83729e03470c1361_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/1/e670e2ac3c588beb7161ca8eff1156c1_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Couple Living 8,000 Miles Apart Keep Meeting Halfway for 3 Years to Take the Same Adorable Picture but Then He Decides to Change Things Up"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/1/ce412fe96d0f731c9a8712855cebda01_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Meaningful Ways to Express Love That Make a Relationship Stronger"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
