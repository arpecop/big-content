However, there’s no real reason to feel this way. Lice usually find their way to heads that are clean, in order to have room for moving around. So first of all, relax. And secondly, prepare to fight off this nuisance as soon as humanly possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below are several ways you can get rid of lice without breaking the bank. There’s no need to go for expensive treatment. The main way to avoid lice is to adopt certain methods even before they make an appearance. You’d learn all about these below as well:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;19. Relax!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-25.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;First of all, you have a lot to do. However, you wouldn’t get anywhere by panicking or feeling disgusted. You may not like the idea of lice, but they won’t harm the health in any way. It’s just an uncomfortable and embarrassing position to be in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So take a deep breath, and rally your forces around you. You need to get the mature lice out as well as those pesky eggs called nits. Special shampoos can only go so far before lice adapt to them, so you have to become strong. Think of this as a month-long project at the very least. You need to be on the alert, not a panicking mess.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;18. The Basic Homemade Removal Method&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-26.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;First of all, try out the mouthwash method. You would need some mouthwash like Listerine, a lice comb, a nit comb, white wine vinegar, and a shower cap. Don’t forget a towel to drape around the neck!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Make your hair wet using the mouthwash, then cover with the shower cap. If you don’t have one, use any plastic bag and secure it in place. Keep it like this for around an hour. Lice hate mouthwash with a passion! When this is done, rinse out the mouthwash with water.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re not done yet! Now put the vinegar on your head in the same way. This helps in doing away with the nits that hold on to your hair for dear life. Again, cover your head and leave for an hour. Now all you have to do is shampoo your head. Lice and nit combs would get the (hopefully dead) things out of your hair quite easily now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;17. Comb, Comb, Comb&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-27.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;It’s a tedious task, but there’s really no better or more effective way for lice removal. Vigilant combing has been the best standard for generations, and it’s not going anywhere. Even if you use any other treatment, combing has to be part of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best way to go about combing for lice and nits is to divide your hair into sections. Untangle the hair completely. Then comb through each section, taking care not to get the combed parts come into contact with the others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;16. A Little Bit of Risk&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-28.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;If just combing isn’t cutting it, you may have to adopt a riskier method. Pyrethrins/Pyrethrum is an active substance, used in several products such as Rid. This ingredient is derived from chrysanthemums, which act as natural insecticides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you use products with this ingredient, you may be able to kill off lice. However, lice are very hardy and may not even respond to this toxin. It could also be harmful to children, so be sure to take your doctor’s advice before using this method.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The way to use this is to apply on dry hair and let it soak for ten minutes. When you use water on your air with this, it would make a lather. Use this as a shampoo and rinse it out. Then you would have to comb your hair to remove the dead ice and any remaining nits. Apply again after a week or so to kill off any survivors. Be aware that this method could cause allergic actions. Cease usage immediately if you notice any.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. The Good Green Oil&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-29.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;You probably have some olive oil as a healthy alternative in your kitchen. Olive oil is very thick, so much so that it just may smother lice if used properly. Apply the oil to your hair and scalp, and then cover with a shower cap. Leave all this on overnight in order to catch every single louse. In the morning, you can comb to get out the lice. Even the nuts should come out easily since olive oil works as a lubricant. Hence, nits lose their hold on the hair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may have to apply the oil over a period of three weeks or so. Leave a few days between each application for the nits to hatch and the lice to mature. Be sure to apply and comb out before the lice have a chance to lay more eggs, though!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. Juicing the Onion&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-30.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Many swear by onion juice as a way to regrow hair. It can also kill head lice due to its high sulphuric content. All you need to do is extract the onion juice by grinding a few onions. Apply this juice to your scalp. Cover it all up with a shower cap or plastic bag. Leave this on for a couple of hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You would have to shampoo afterward with slightly warm water. Otherwise, the smell would probably be too overpowering. After your hair is dry, make use of lice and nit combs. Three days in a row should do the trick. Follow it up with a weekly treatment for the next two months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Burning ‘em up!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-31.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Some studies talk about killing nits through blasting them with hot air. However, make sure you never do this after applying a chemical treatment. Many of the lotions for lice treatments are flammable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Coconut Oil for Everything&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-32.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Coconut oil comes in handy for several beauty treatments. It’s not surprising that many swear by it as a lice treatment too! It’s also beneficial for your hair. Warm around three tablespoons of this magic oil and add in some camphor. Apply all over your head, cover with a shower cap, and go to sleep. In the morning, comb out what you can.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can wash your hair later, but be sure to use the coconut oil method for five consecutive days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. The Immersion Method&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-33.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;This simply involves putting all your hair under water. Some hope this would drown the lice. However, lice are able to withstand complete immersion even for some hours. It’s worth a shot, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Another Lotion&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-34.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Ivermectin Lotion is a medicinal treatment, but one that is officially approved. The brand name for this is Sklice, and it is derived from bacteria commonly found in soil. This substance can actually paralyze lice and this kills them. This is not for use on tiny tots under six months, though.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Even a single application can have wondrous effects. Nit combing is also not needed if one applies it at least twice! While there are some side effects, less than one percent of the subjects in clinical trials experienced them. When they did, the effects were no more than a bit of skin and eye irritation. Still, if you do experience something like this, we would recommend discontinuing the use of Sklice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When using this lotion, all you need to do is put it in dry hair. You can then wash everything out after ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. You Jelly?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-35.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;When it comes to suffocating out those little buggers, there’s probably no better choice than regular hair gel. You can also take the help of petroleum jelly. These are usually products that everyone has about the house somewhere. However, you may want to take this treatment with a pinch of salt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The gooey texture of these substances may or may not suffocate lice, but many mothers say it works. There have been some studies that say petroleum jelly is better than any other homemade solution for lice. Still, the official associations say that it’s a basically useless method. Plus, the jelly is very difficult to get out of your hair once it’s in&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, when it comes to lice, every procedure is worth a shot. You can try it out for yourself by citing the affected hair and scalp with gel or jelly. Then go one night with a shower cap on the head. Wash out everything when you wake up. The lice would hopefully come out in the washing, but you would still have to comb any remaining units out. If the lice persist, try the treatment again after a week. This would give the nits time to get big enough to be suffocated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. The Stunning Spell&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-36.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;5% Benzyl alcohol lotion is strong enough to be purchased with a prescription. If you’re looking for a brand name, try Ulesfia. This lotion became available to the public in 2009. When you apply it to an affected scalp, it can kill lice by literally stopping their breathing. Nits, however, are beyond its power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clinical trials have proved the effectiveness of this solution, but you need to apply it at least twice. When tested, around two-thirds of affected people were free from lice within a couple of weeks. The lotion itself is fine if you’re using it for children aged six months at least. However, be sure to check for eye and skin inflammation after one use. If things get too uncomfortable, don’t use this method.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The way to use this lotion is to coat your hair and scalp with it. Make sure your hair is dry. Then just let it all work for around ten minutes. You can then rinse your hair out. For best results, shampoo your hair and use a comb to get rid of the dead lice and nits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Condiment Time&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-38.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Mayonnaise is a surprisingly great food for the hair! It can make your hair go all silky and shiny, and may kill off lice at the same time! Many have claimed that mayonnaise suffocates lice by not letting them breathe. However, lice are hardy little creatures and their breathing holes can close to prevent their deaths.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who’ve had success with the mayonnaise treatment go for full-fat, natural mayonnaise. Don’t be afraid and used a large amount on your hair and scalp. Cover it up with a shower cap, and get a good night’s sleep. Then shampoo it all out and comb through for nits. You can also wait one week and do it all over again to catch more mature lice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. The Shrink Wrap&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-40.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;While shrink wrap is great for wrapping up food, it doesn’t really do anything for the lice in your hair. This method actually calls for a product you can purchase to apply to your hair. This is called Cetaphil and is actually a face cleanser. However, it is not toxic or harsh, so it won’t do any harm to kids or the hair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simply apply the Cetaphil and try getting it out with a comb. Afterwards, you can blow-dry your hair. Best results are found when you do this at least three times. Go one week in between treatments to let the nits hatch into lice and thus become more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This technique has actually gone through a study in 2004 and has proved effective. In fact, some doctors may even officially recommend it to their patients. More than ninety percent of people who used it were free from lice when the three treatments were up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. The Ubiquitous Tea Tree Oil&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-42.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;If you’re not up for chemical treatments, consider tea tree oil. This is a nice-smelling natural oil that can also act as an insecticide. It can not only help with killing off lice but also relieve the itching it causes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order to get the maximum benefit of tea tree oil, put some drops of it in your shampoo. Use a couple of drops for each ounce. After your hair dries, use lice and nit combs to remove the carcasses!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can also mix up two methods here. Combine a teaspoon of tea tree oil and three tablespoon olive oil. For a better smell, add some eucalyptus oil. Put all this on the hair and scalp. Make sure that you don’t leave out any patches. You can then use shampoo for rinsing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When using tea tree oil, you can apply it twice a week. Don’t use this method for more than two months though. While natural, tea tree oil is a strong substance and can be harmful if overused.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Look Around You&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-44.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;While getting rid of the lice, indulge in a bit of extra housekeeping. No, you don’t have to disinfect the entire house for fear of lice in every corner. Lice usually cannot live more than a couple of days without a scalp. They also cannot fly from one place to another, nor can they jump. They can only be transferred by direct head contact with an infected area or head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’re good to go if you just wash the things that have recently been exposed to an affected head. This includes pillowcases, sheets, caps, etc. Be sure to clean the lice and nit combs as well as the brushes with hot water.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Call the Experts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-46.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;If you just can’t do it yourself, there are nit-picking services available. Have no fear in calling in the professionals. The industry is somewhat standardized now, but it would be best to ask around for the best services at hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Vacuuming them up!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-48.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;When nothing else works, invest a little more. The Lousebuster in now available in the market. This works somewhat like a vacuum cleaner with a brush. Of course, the size is suitable for use on a head. This little contraption directs hot air to the scalp. The fact of this is that the lice and eggs get all dried out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This device was available back in 2006, and studies showed its effectiveness in doing away with most nits and lice. However, you must make sure to purchase the LouseBuster through the properly certified vendors. The treatment usually doesn’t take more than half an hour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Head to the Kitchen Sink&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-50.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;We’ll give you a little advice here that isn’t directly connected to lice removal. All that suffocating stuff you put into your hair for lice removal can be hard to get out with conventional shampoos. The greasy residue can become a cause for concern. Worry not, though. We have a solution that is most likely sitting in your kitchen right now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simply grab some dishwashing liquid (Dawn works wonders) and put a good amount on the hair. Any Vaseline, hair gel, mayonnaise or other goo would be washed away most effectively. In fact, this may help with the lice removal after all. The breaking-down power of dish soaps could be strong enough to detach the nits from the hair strands. Try it and see!&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;There’s no need for lice removal to be a painful task. However, it does require a lot of effort. If it gets those crawling bugs away from you, though, it’s more than worth it all!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"The Secret No Doctor Tells You: This Is How You Get Rid of Lice Quick and Cheap!","description":"Head lice are annoying and disgusting, but definitely controllable.
