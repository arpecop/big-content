Some of these fashion trends were adopted by major names of the industry such as Gigi Hadid and Rihanna showing us their bold sense of style. Though we may not like them and even find some absolutely ridiculous, they did go viral. That’s something that cannot be denied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take a look at some these absurd fashion trends that emerged in 2017.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;18. Car mat skirts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Balenciaga came out with what they call “car design skirt”. Skirts that resemble a car mat. As if that wasn’t crazy enough, they are sold for around 2000 dollars. Balenciaga was extensively criticized for it being similar to a 40 dollar car mat. They claim its posh leather with similar groves to that of a car mat. Still doesn’t justify how horrendous the skirt really is. Who would spend 2000 dollars on a car mat?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1537.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Twitter &lt;h2&gt;17. Double Jeans&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another bizarre trend that hit the store in 2017 is the double jeans. What is a double jean you may ask? It’s basically jeans on top of jeans. It has two waits. The upper one looks more like a high-waist jeans whereas the other is low-waist. The designer allegedly claims that having two waistbands gives it a “high-low profile”. I don’t know about that. The dress is currently sold out online. Although not as bad as the car mat skirts and the dry cleaner dress, it is still up there with the price point. Rihanna was spotted wearing one of these. Its fashion trend if Rihanna does it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1538.jpeg&quot;/&gt;tumblr &lt;h2&gt;16. The IKEA’s Frakta shopping bags&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As if we haven’t had enough of the car mat skirts, Balenciaga come out with another copycat design. This time it is the Ikea Frakta bag that’s making an appearance on the runway. The bag Balenciaga came out with is made from blue, wrinkled, glazed leather. The 40p Ikea tote is made from a synthetic material. Ikea claims to be happy about the fact that there Frakta bag inspired a fashion designer. Also, said that, “Now our customers can truly have the designer look for less”. Frankly speaking, I won’t buy an Ikea tote for 2000 dollars even if it was made from unicorn tears.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1539.jpeg&quot;/&gt;says.com &lt;h2&gt;15. Jeans Bikini-Pants&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am at a loss for words on this one. This is definitely setting the bar high-up for the horrendous fashion trends. Now we have the strange jeans bikini-pant which is bound to raise some eye brows. Fusing a bikini with jeans pants, the Bikini Pants from Japanese clothing company Sanna’s Brazil Fashion totally blur the line between jeans and a string bikini.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1540.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur &lt;h2&gt;14. Two-faced shoes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have heard of people being two faced. Now, you can get shoes to match your two-faced personality. These shoes are literally double-faced as they are the same on front and back with pointy toes. These Hood by Air boots were made in collaboration with Frye. It is said to be an experimental design that graced the runway. Hope it stays just on the runway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1541.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Twitter &lt;h2&gt;13. Duvet Ponchos&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;These duvet ponchos were worn by models during the London fashion week. Mulberry has stolen the show with these super comfy and warm looking ponchos. It’s every lazy person’s dream come true. Although essentially made out of duvet, these cost more than a hundred comforters. I’m buying myself one. Lazy, no-effort dress for the people with lazy personalities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1542.jpeg&quot;/&gt;the-pool &lt;h2&gt;12. Men’s hairy chest swimsuit&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don’t know who would want to wear this. A new and improved way of showing skin this summer? I hope not. These swim suits with a man’s hairy chest printed on it have gone viral and for the wrong reasons. These swimsuits also come in 3 different skin shades to match yourself I guess. This was made by the company Beloved shirts. I don’t know what the designer was thinking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1543.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur &lt;h2&gt;11. Romphim&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heard of the romper? Romp-her. I present to you the Romp-him. These are basically lacy rompers for men. A company called the ACED Design released the Romp-him. Rompers for men had come about previously but this time they blew up the internet. I’m a little skeptical about the trend. What about you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1544.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur &lt;h2&gt;10. Clear Knee Mom Jeans&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;These 95 dollar Topshop pants are every mom’s nightmare. The reasoning behind naming them mom jeans is still unknown. Women don’t need to wear unflattering clothing once they become moms. You can be sure to wipe fog and sweat off the clear plastic if you buy them. Thanks, I’ll pass.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1546.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Twitter &lt;h2&gt;9. Pre-destroyed Margiela sneakers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have a lot of money to throw around? Want to ear worn out shoes but don’t have the time to wear your shoes and tear them. Now, you can already destroyed shoes with a high price tag of 1424 dollars. These shoes come ready to wear with peeled leather and ripped a sole.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1548.jpeg&quot;/&gt;solecollector.com &lt;h2&gt;8. Fried Chicken pants&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Want to look like a chicken piece but no time? Wear these pants instead. Not sure if they make your legs look like chicken pieces or carrots but you be sure you’ll be absolutely fabulous wearing these. I will admit that this is kind of creative but does it really work? That perhaps you’ll have to find out yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1550.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Twitter &lt;h2&gt;7. Straw Hat Dress&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This dress is perfect for people who love wearing hats but not on their heads. This straw hat dress retails for around 3000 dollars. And I thought the cleaner bag dress was expensive. There is no lining under the dress which means the entire experience is sure to be quite itchy. It’s made out of 8 straw hats all stitched together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1552.jpeg&quot;/&gt;hearstapps &lt;h2&gt;6. Sweater sleeves&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do you wear when it’s too hot for a shirt but at same time cold enough for you to wear a sweater? You wear the sweater sleeves. This 2000 dollar “thing” by Calvin Klein took the internet by storm. It’s completely sold out. Although it looks like it’s just sleeves, there actually exists a middle section. The middle section is almost sheer. The sweater is unisex. Nice to know and still not buying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1554.jpeg&quot;/&gt;twitter &lt;h2&gt;5. Crotch-less Jeans&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;These jeans are deconstructed in a way that there is no crotch just the waist and the legs attached by suspenders. Among the fans of the brand that launched the crotch-less jeans is Gigi hadid. She was spotted wearing these. The jeans at priced at 300 dollars and the model is shown wearing an oversized shirt dress underneath.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1556.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Twitter &lt;h2&gt;4. Clear jeans&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the clear knee mom jeans trend, the internet decided to take it to the next level by showing us the clear jeans. Why would anyone want to look like gift wrap? What do wear underneath? What’s the use if you have to wear another jean underneath? What do you do if the plastic fogs up? So many questions…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1558.jpeg&quot;/&gt;twitter &lt;h2&gt;3. Ultra Long sleeves&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first question that pops up in my mind is the inconvenience these sleeves would cause. How do you roll your sleeves up? How do pass someone salt on dining table? You’ll be giving your sleeves a nice soak in the gravy. The designers can make literally anything into a trend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1560.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tumblr &lt;h2&gt;2. Huge Ruffles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Huge ruffles and flowing cuts have made a comeback this year. The internet is divided in their opinion of this trend. I think this is the one decent, wearable trend that 2017 has seen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1562.jpeg&quot;/&gt;pinimg &lt;h2&gt;1. The Trump-suit&lt;/h2&gt;     &lt;p&gt;This is the best thing to happen in 2017. This swim suit will leave the audience spell bound and in shock. Also considering the fact that it is sold a reasonable price of 50 dollar, I would suggest getting some head to turn this summer at the beach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1564.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"The 18 Strangest Fashion Trends of 2017, and We're Going to Be Scarred for a While!","description":"18 strangest fashion trends that will make you cringe"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/1/5007d35d4d619925a86e49f5cf12a7e1_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/1/50a49d9c7806bbc0ee579e1d617efcb1_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"7 Tips To Make Your Butt Bigger"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/1/4ec9766416ed1ef3545bc2df988cb751_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"9 Habits That Can Do More Harm Than Good"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
