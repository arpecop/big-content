Apart from those lucky individuals who have naturally lean bodies and healthy metabolisms, maintaining fitness and weight loss can be really tough for a lot of people, even with all those hours in the gym and careful eating habits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, the key here is to keep at it rather than letting your resolve go weak and slip back into the old routine. It can feel like a struggle a lot of the time and you start to wonder whether you will ever see any results. However, that is when you need to keep pushing yourself instead of throwing in the towel. While the enormity of the weight loss challenge can hardly be overstated, these tips gathered after consultation with top nutritionists will surely help you make a difference on your weight loss journey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Weight Loss Is a Marathon, Not a Sprint&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1636.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is very important to understand that there are no quick fixes or crash courses for weight loss. You have to go the whole hog. And this is bound to take time. Expecting quick fixes is not going to get you anywhere. You might be able to shed some pounds with a crash diet or some such high fitness program, but that fat is bound to come back as quickly as it supposedly went away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, avoid any instant solutions to shed weight gained in all likelihood over a long time. It is understandably difficult to maintain that fitness regime for a long period of time. But as with all good things in life, this also does not come easy. Try and push yourself in those instances when you feel like giving up. Use all obstacles and setbacks as learning experiences, rather than as excuses to give up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Get Comfortable with Moderation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1637.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There really is no truth to the claims that you need to give up certain types of foods in order shed those extra pounds. By and large, you can eat whatever you want to, the only condition being that you keep the portion sizes moderate. Just give up the late night binging on that ice cream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Keep your portions during meals moderate and there is no reason why you have to give up any type of food that you may want to eat. For instance, eat your dinner in a salad plate instead of a dinner plate. This will cut the portion size in half and you would not have excess of anything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Drink Water Before Meals&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1638.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drinking some water a little bit before taking a meal can boost your metabolism by as much as 30% over the next 90 minutes. This will enable you to burn more calories. As per the results of a recent study, drinking about half a liter of water half an hour before a meal causes the person to eat fewer calories and lose up to 44% more weight in the process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Regulate Your Sugar Intake&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1639.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is arguably a crucial element of your weight loss journey. Keeping your sugar intake moderate and under control can be a massive plus. Avoid processed sugars and artificial sweeteners as much as possible. Try not to consume a lot of sugary soft drinks, sweets, synthetic juices, confectioneries, and the like. Focus more on eating fruits because the sugar in them is more natural and comes loaded with other important nutrients such as vitamins, calcium, and minerals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Make Eggs a Regular Fixture in Your Breakfast Routine&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1640.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having eggs for breakfast can have multiple benefits, weight loss being one of them. Numerous studies have shown that having an egg-based breakfast instead of one that is heavy on grains will cause you to eat fewer calories during the following 36 hours, and lose more weight as a result.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Drink Lots of Green Tea&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1641.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apart from being a wonderful cleansing agent for your body, green tea is also great for weight loss. There are strong antioxidants called “catechins” in green tea, which remove toxins from the body and also help in fat burning. A couple of cups of green tea on a daily basis will give you very good results over time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Use Coconut or Olive Oil for Cooking&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1642.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using these two oils for cooking purposes can be very beneficial. They are both high in good fats like triglycerides which metabolize differently compared to other regular fats. They also help to boost metabolism by as much as 120 calories. On the whole, these good fats can reduce your calorie intake by up to 256 calories per day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Avoid Falling for the Gluten-Free Trap&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1643.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just because something is gluten-free does not mean that it must be healthy and good for you. While you may lose some weight due to a gluten-free diet, in all likelihood it is not because of the gluten-free diet but because you have started making better food choices and consuming less processed carbs. So be careful with gluten-free foods, particularly the packaged ones that come with increased calories and fat for flavor enhancement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cut Down on Processed and Refined Carbs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1644.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Processed carbohydrates like white sugar and non-fibrous grains such as white bread and pasta can cause instant blood sugar spike, causing you to feel more hunger pangs and greater cravings for processed carbs. This will likely result in more food consumption than usual, thus increasing your calorie intake in the process. So, keep your processed carbs intake moderate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Keep Healthy Snacks Within Easy Reach&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1645.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Go for healthy snacks and fruits to satisfy those slight hunger pangs in the evening or other times. Having healthy food nearby will also help keep your mind away from consuming unhealthy food. Whole fruits, nuts (almonds, peanuts, walnuts etc.), yoghurt, corn, and baby carrots are good choices to satisfy those small hunger pangs in the evenings or other times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Maintain a Steady Workout Routine&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1646.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Complement your healthy diet plan with a steady workout schedule. Be it a run in the early morning or evening or time spent in the gym, figure what works best for you and stick to it. And in this day and age where there is an app for everything, make use of a good fitness app if your busy schedule does not allow regular running or visits to the gym.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These apps allow for quick, high-intensity workout which you can easily perform in your bedroom or living room or any other place at any time. Apps like 7 Minute Workout and Sworkit provide comprehensive step-by-step guidance help you through your workout routine anytime anywhere. And it only takes a few minutes to do them. Stick to them over a long period of time and you will definitely see results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;You Cannot Compensate for a Bad Diet With Excessive Workout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1647.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a common misconception that as long you run long miles and work out excessively, your unhealthy eating habits will not be a problem. While certain individuals might be able to carry such a lifestyle due to their naturally lean bodies and healthy metabolisms, it is unadvisable in general. To keep that belly fat away, it is important to watch what you eat and not just rely on excessive physical activity to shed those pounds off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Understand Your Unique Body Dynamics and Develop a Weight Loss Plan Accordingly&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1648.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is important to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all formula for fitness and weight loss. What works for one individual might not be appropriate for another. While there is no harm in seeking nutrition and workout advice from a certified professional, it is important that you figure out yourself what works best for you. Because nobody knows you or your body better than your own self, so analyze yourself fully and then plan accordingly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Don’t Discount the Value of Sleep&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1649.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Unless you are amongst that somewhat lucky group of individuals who can function on about 4 or 5 hours of sleep a day, it is not a good idea to sacrifice your sleep time. The importance of adequate sleep in maintaining good health and fitness can hardly be overstated. This is the first step towards developing a healthy lifestyle. Only if you are well-rested at the start of every day will you be able to extract full benefits from your eating habits and workout routine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"22 Top Weight Loss Tips, According to Nutritionists","description":"Maintaining fitness and a healthy lifestyle remains a challenge for a lot of people all around the world.
