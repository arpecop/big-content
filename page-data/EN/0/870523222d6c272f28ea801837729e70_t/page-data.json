Her life revolved around eating fast food and binge watching her favourite shows on Netflix &lt;em&gt; “All I did was eat, go to work, and watch my shows.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-64.jpeg&quot;/&gt;getfitwjessica // Instagram &lt;p&gt;Somewhere during the start of 2016 however, she decided that she had had enough and would now take control of her life and bring her weight down to healthier levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first thing to go out of her diet was junk food. Changing her eating habits and eating foods which were healthy. This was followed by up with physical exercise regimen. She cut back on the Netflix bingeing and instead started off by slow, with walking, eventually she took up working out from videos she found on Youtube. Eventually she hit the place which every person living an unhealthy lifestyle dreads- the gym.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-65.jpeg&quot;/&gt;getfitwjessica // Instagram &lt;p&gt;However, now she has become a regular and in fact feels very motivated to workout and exercises at the gym for two hours every day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jessica has shared her experiences on social media platforms mainly on Instagram in order to encourage others to improve their lives. &lt;em&gt; “My name is Jessica and I’m 21,I’m 5’4 and I have lost over 170 lbs with diet and exercise. Starting at over 320 lbs and currently between 145-148. There were and still are obstacles that get in the way, but that’s just the way it is and I have to deal with it. Did I let me give up? NEVER.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-66.jpeg&quot;/&gt;getfitwjessica // Instagram &lt;h2&gt;Amazing transformation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-67.jpeg&quot;/&gt;getfitwjessica // Instagram &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I have dedicated my life to fitness and I have learned to love it when before I started this journey, I would dread just walking to the bus stop that was not even a 5 minute walk.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-68.jpeg&quot;/&gt;getfitwjessica // Instagram &lt;p&gt;As Jessica has shed weight, her health is not the only thing that has improved. &lt;em&gt; “I never expected to be where I am today. I was shy, but now I have so much more confidence, I have so much more energy… It’s crazy the things I can do now that I couldn’t do before.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the experiences of Jessica and countless others like her shows, it is never too late to try to turn our lives around by taking charge of things. We can do just about anything if we really put our mind to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A healthy mind is in a healthy body as her experiences show when we make a an effort to improve our health, not only does our health improve but our lives improve in virtually all spheres energy, confidence, productivity everything improves as we feel better about ourselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, being obese or overweight is not just about looks it is a real global health issue. As per figures provided by the National Institute of Health overweight and obesity combined lead to a staggering 300,000 deaths in the United States annually and have become and the second leading preventable cause of the death in the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The global obesity epidemic is not just limited to developed nations and countries in the Middle East and elsewhere are also suffering from the obesity epidemic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If these trends continue, by 2025, global obesity prevalence will reach 18% in men and surpass 21% in women; severe obesity will surpass 6% in men and 9% in women,” &lt;/em&gt;– Report&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;All of us can and should make an effort to change our unhealthy and sedentary lifestyle choices which have not only sapped our confidence and hit us in the looks department; these choices have had and continue to have serious health effects. The time for change is now !&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Overweight Woman Ditches 2 Common Habits & Loses over 170 Lbs","description":"A teenager decides to turn her life around and sheds almost half her weight."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/0/870523222d6c272f28ea801837729e70_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/0/8813254a66078b0573857a45f4c0e920_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Do You Have a Male or Female Brain?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/0/85ad2f9239eb0b89a9fcacdd3224c3d0_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Reasons Why Kind People Fail to Be Happy"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
