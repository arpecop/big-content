Turn towards a child or an adult and you will see them speaking about X-Men with passion, mesmerized by their heroic tales of bravery, love and loyalty. Despite being a fictional concept, X-Men have been successful in accumulating a massive fan league for itself in a very short tenure. But who exactly are X-Men?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a brief introduction, X-Men are mutants blessed with supernatural abilities that they employ to maintain harmony on the earth and protecting its inhabitants from the devils. The inception of this heroic league was done in 1963, by Stan Lee, who is honored to be the writer of this fictional comic book series. However, owing to the augmenting optimistic response from the comic book followers, the X-Men characters were soon incorporated in movies, games and cartoons. Where children were thrilled to play X-Men video games, enjoying the moment of controlling these super heroes, adults were equally thrilled to watch the superior stunts of these mutants in movies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regardless of being a hardcore X-Men fan, we all are still oblivious to some of the hidden facts about this renowned series. Let’s have a sneak peek into some of its pivotal characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Douglas Ramsey-Cypher (Weakest):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It cannot be denied that before his resurrection, Cypher had a humdrum existence in the series. Despite owning the gift of comprehending all languages, his gift was considered futile due to the telepathic powers that all the other mutants use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although his gift often came in use while aiding X-Men in communicating with alien enemies, it wasn’t very effective as most of the enemies were machine operated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1539.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;h2&gt;Gabriel Summers- Vulcan (Strongest):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Summers live under the pseudonym of Vulcan and as per Professor X; the leader of the X-Men league, the superpowers of Vulcan trespasses those of other X-Men mutants. From his ability to absorb energies to flying in the air, you would definitely not want to confront him face to face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1540.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;h2&gt;Colin McKay- Kylun (Weakest):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Followed by his abduction in childhood, the Queen A’isha’s counsellor turned him into a warrior with some efforts over the years. His combating skills earned him the label of the mutant, but at the price of altering his appearance akin to a lion. Although, Kylan depicted his gifts of emulating sounds and brandishing swords, they offered a very restricted advantage to his fellow mutants. Such gifts would have been more appreciated, if Kylan would have performed in a circus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1541.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;h2&gt;Matthew Malloy (Strongest):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The exhibition of Malloy’s superior gifts could be attributed to the many unfortunate events that enveloped his life. He was so shaken by his tragedies that his misery finally exploded in the form of his veiled powers that ruined the entire city. Possessing the talents of telepathy, self-resurrection, teleportation and energy generation, he has been accredited by his leader as the Omega Level Mutant. You would surely think twice before confronting his intense powers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1542.jpeg&quot;/&gt;marvel wikia.com &lt;h2&gt;Danielle Moonstar- Mirage (Weakest):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One is qualified as a mutant only when he has something unique to offer, but some mutants are less competent relative to their fellows. This goes for Mirage, whose appearance can bluff you into thinking that her powers are a great contribution. In contrast, her powers are limited to horse riding or catching future highlights.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1543.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikimedia &lt;h2&gt;Robert Louis Drake- Iceman (Strongest):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a first impression, you might not believe that Iceman is an Alpha level mutant. His intense powers of thermo kinesis, thermal vision and ice clone generation were unveiled in one of his battles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1544.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Marvel Wikia &lt;h2&gt;Jubilation Lee- Jubilee (Weakest):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;With her Yellow dress accompanied with a funky hairstyle, Jubilee would surely seem attractive to you. However, her powers barely exist and she is not much of a use to her fellow mutants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1545.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;h2&gt;Illyana Rasputina- Magik (Strongest):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In terms of powers, Rasputina is one of the most uniquely gifted mutants, whose powers have contributed immensely in the achievement of X-Men’s mission. Regardless of being an expert in black magic, she has never used her power nefariously. Her superior abilities of moving through time and space, being multilingual and deciphering the tricks of white and black magic is what makes her one of the strongest of X-Men mutants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1546.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Marvel Wikia &lt;h2&gt;Xi’an Coy Manh- Karma (Weakest):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In spite of Karma’s ability of possessing minds, her power has been proven to be more troublesome rather than a blessing for the X-Men mutants. Due to her ineffective control of her powers, she has often been left stuck in the devil’s body, only making it dangerous for the mutants to hunt her down and rescue her.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1547.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;h2&gt;Jean Grey- the Phoenix (Strongest):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Honored as an Omega level mutant, Grey’s power intensity is tantamount to the energy required for the destruction of the universe. For this reason, her accession to her powers was blocked until she reached maturity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1548.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;h2&gt;Angelo Espinosa- Skin (Weakest):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Skin looked as if he was maledicted rather than being blessed with a unique power. All he could facilitate was expanding his skin, that didn’t contract back and resisting force. For this reason, it’s difficult to explain anything more about him, except that he was really weird.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1549.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;h2&gt;Nathaniel Grey- X-Man (Strongest):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;X-Man was labelled as one of the best mutants, renowned for his scrupulous thinking, telepathy and physical combative skills. But fate was against him and his powers were ultimately crumbled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1550.jpeg&quot;/&gt;MarvelWikia &lt;h2&gt;Brian Cruz- Tag (Weakest):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;He is one of the most mundane characters of the X-Men league, whose only ability is to tag objects to gain people’s attraction or repulsion towards it. Even you can guess that this ability was hardly of any use in the X-Men’s mission.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1551.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;h2&gt;David Haller- Legion (Strongest):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Legion is said to have a multiple personality disorder, possessing numerous powers that hadn’t been fully unleashed, with new ones being constantly generated. Being Xavier’s son, it is not surprising to know that his powers are considered to be infinite.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1552.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;h2&gt;Trevor Hawkins- Eye-Boy (Weakest):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having his body covered with numerous eyes, Eye boy can detect and see danger form each and every angle, making him a mutant who can work from behind the curtains only.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1553.jpeg&quot;/&gt;MarvelWikia &lt;h2&gt;Absolon Mercator- Mr. M (Strongest):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Think of all the coolest superpowers that you crave to possess and feel jealous of Mr. M because he already has them all. From telepathy to self-regeneration and machinery control, everything is elementary for him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1554.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;h2&gt;Barnell Bohusk- Beak (Weakest):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amidst the X-Men league, also exists a creature who lacks any supernatural strength, rather he is regarded as a mutant only because of his ability to mutate into bird like features that repels his foes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1555.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;h2&gt;Quintavius Quire- Kid Omega (Strongest):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;His unparalleled intelligence makes this kid distinct in the mutant’s gang. However, to what his leader and fellow mutants are oblivious to is that his competence might result in quite a few troubles for the group, jeopardizing their mission.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1556.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;h2&gt;Hector Rendoza- Wraith (Weakest):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having Wraith on the team is a good news or bad one is still a dubious matter. The maximum that he was capable of before the unfortunate day when he lost his powers was to make himself and his fellows transparent, which was sometimes a lifesaving hack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1557.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;h2&gt;Franklin Richards- Kid Richards (Strongest):&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It will be pure ignorance to underestimate his powers considering him as a kid. From telepathy, to force manipulation and dream projection, there is hardly anything that this kid isn’t proud of doing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1558.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia     &lt;p&gt;Reaching to this line, you must be planning to open up a comic book or put up a movie again, to decipher all of these X-Men figures in a new light, or rather to say in their true light.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Strongest Mutants in X-Men and 10 Weakest","description":"A sneak peek into the reality of X-Men’s characters"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/0/6b14ba7ec5eec8c3bca597d9df85ee40_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/0/6ead2070110180381dc5784a7d153ba0_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Salaries of These Victoria's Secret Models Will Burn You With Jealousy"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/0/540212e262e24baf382d0e6309cefad0_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Texts From Best Friends Who Are Always There to Assist."}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
