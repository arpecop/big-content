Finally, look top left and alternate with bottom right a few times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This simple exercise will help you stretch your extra ocular muscles. It gets you out of the habit of just staring 1 to 2 feet in front of your face which is what most people tend to do at their screens all day long.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Drawing Figures.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-701.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Try to draw different figures with your gaze.
