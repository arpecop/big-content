It’s little ponder that hundreds of years back, the seas were expected to cover up strange creatures; one of them being mermaids. Mermaids are aquatic creatures, which are said to have long hair like a woman and beauty that match no other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There has been mere confusion related to their true existence. Supposedly, people have sighted mermaids in the past and the investigation continues to this day but the question arises time to time; are mermaids real? Do they really exist? If they do exist, why don’t we commonly see them? Although, there haven’t been many encounters when it comes to the history of mermaids but we have gathered the selective few for you to judge if they are real or just folklore!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read below to find out about famous mermaid legends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Minnesota Mermaid&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1938.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Paranormal Elite &lt;p&gt;The story dates back to October, 2017 when in Minnesota a mermaid was found! An Australian man was keen to hang out at the beach when he suddenly noticed something strange. He saw two men covered in yellow hazmat suits, dragging a humanly creature off-shore. What was amazing about the creature was its noticeable green fin and womanly body on top; it sure had a clear appearance of a mermaid but was it really a mermaid?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It looked like the two men were taking the creature to the stretcher nearby. However, what the world will never find out is the fact if the two men were seeking medical attention or taking the creature for a detailed experimental check-up. Also, are you also wondering where it might be right now? Same here!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ladysmith Mermaid&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1939.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tumblr &lt;p&gt;In 2013, a lady from Waaihoek, South Africa outside Ladysmith, claims she saw a mermaid and not just that, additionally spared its life. The gathering with myth occurred on a Saturday evening when Fisani was en route to a nearby shop to purchase cool drink. When she reached the extension that keeps running over the Madazane River, she saw four young men tossing rocks at something. She asked them what they were doing and “the young men revealed to me they were murdering a snake that could speak” Upon nearer review, Fisani saw something that was half lady and half fish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The animal shouted at her in isiZulu which is a language, begging her to help it. This extremely scared Fisani and she took off running. “I fled extremely quick, however I could in any case hear the thing’s shouts for help. It resembled it was conversing with me particularly. It disclosed to me it wouldn’t hurt me and to please help it. “It said it wouldn’t hurt me, so I helped it over into the water.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At that point it raised its arms and expressed gratitude toward me.” After this, it vanished into the water. She asserted it was Caucasian with blonde hair, and cried genuine tears. “It was the extent of a child, however had completely created features.” Surprisingly, the river where the mermaid was spotted has dried up completely now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Russian Mermaid&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1940.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tumblr &lt;p&gt;Russia is known for the beauty that its people behold, especially the women. In Russia, there was a mysterious creature spotted in a lake. The creature was somewhat different than normal water creatures that roam in the water. At first, the people who saw the creature thought it was a monster but they were proven wrong after certain facts and figures related to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The locals, on the other hand, have firm belief that the creature must be a mermaid as it was spotted as half-human, half-fish. They have assumed that the lake where it was found is the mermaid’s residence and the place where it normally hides. However, the question is left unanswered, if the mermaid has no legs how did it even reach the lake in the first place?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;New Zealand Mermaid&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1941.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur &lt;p&gt;Off the coast of south Island, in the beautiful sea of Papua New Guinea, seven fishermen were concerned and terrified as they had found some human remains. They did what anyone of us would do upon finding something like that- calling the cops!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cops however investigated the bodies on the sandy beaches and gave a conclusion that the remains were not human but they were actually remains of a creature, that was half human and half fish. The creature clearly showed a fish-like structure below the waist, causing the people to believe that they have finally found the residence of mermaids. Most of the people are still not so sure about the whole incident.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bering Sea Mermaid&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1942.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Legendary people in the history like Shakespeare, Authors including Edward Snow and ordinary people like Captain John Smith claimed an encounter with mermaids. Over the years, in the history of mankind, people have mentioned ancient people and their folks about mermaids. True or not, these stories are still given a lot of importance and plays with the imagination of the people of our modern era.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Just like that, in 1608, there was a young man named Henry Hudson who gave the world his word on seeing a mermaid with his own eyes! Interesting, no? Henry described her complexion as pale, her skin looked gentle to him and she possessed long dark hair which looked good on something as light as her skin complexion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He agreed that there was nothing ugly or unattractive about the mermaid, in fact he found her very captivating. Moreover, he noticed how the mermaid was a human from her head till her belly button and down her waist; she was attached to a fish body- a typical representation of a mermaid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;John Smith’s Mermaid&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1943.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;John Smith might be best known for his “rescue” of Pocahontas, yet in 1614 he was simply one more mariner in the West Indies who had a shot experience with a mermaid. In his words, the green-haired lady had enormous round eyes; a consummately molded nose was “by no means unattractive.” She swung to jump, and he was stunned to see that she was a mermaid. That is the manner by which the story goes, in any case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding, as opposed to confusing an intriguing ocean animal for a woman, it’s conceivable that Smith’s experience quite occurred by any stretch of the imagination. Truth be told, in a post for The Junto, a blog about early American history, student of history Vaughn Scribner, contends that the much referred to story of Smith’s mermaid experience may have never been recorded by Smith himself, and rather composed later by an author. In any case, the story is interesting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Deerness Mermaid&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1944.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikia &lt;p&gt;1890 proved to be a year of research for Scotland. The people of Scotland sighted many mermaids in that year, making it the center of mermaid sightings for that year. Out of all the people who personally witnessed a mermaid, some people saw a half human, half fish creature and described her as the epitome of beauty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They noticed how she climbed on the nearby rocks with her delicate arms and then clawed back to the water. The mermaid was believed to be around 7 feet long, with luscious black hair and pale skin complexion. Although, according to the rumors, she was not a fan of being in the spotlight and was not willing to meet the people who were there waiting desperately for a glimpse of the new being.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Human Fish&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1945.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur &lt;p&gt;As strange as it sounds, during the times of war, the world came across yet another mermaid known as the Human Mermaid. In 1943, when different countries of the world were stuck in a bad conflict, Japanese had set up their surveillance team on the one of the Islands named Kai Island present in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Japanese people were on their search for the enemy team when they actually found a strange creature. The creature was said to have spines on its back and an unusual mouth; it was not the best looking mermaids and was rather scary. However, later the local people who lived there, found a very similar creature like the one which was found earlier. They named it “The Human Fish” in their own language.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hebridean Mermaid:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1946.jpeg&quot;/&gt;tumblr &lt;p&gt;In 1830, a group of people were caught up with cutting sea weed at the Island of Benbecula. One lady detected an animal a few yards out in the water. It resembled a lady in smaller than expected. She called to the others taking a shot at the shore. Men went into the water to attempt to get the animal, however she escaped from them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A kid pointed a stone at her which struck her on the back. She shouted out in torment and vanished underneath the waves. A couple of days after the fact a creature cleaned up dead on the shoreline close to the township of Nunton. One record at the time expressed the upper body of the mermaid was like a nourished offspring of three or four years old, with strangely created breasts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The dead body however was recognized by the locals who were confident enough that the body belonged to a mermaid. They arranged a coffin, a funeral and buried her near the churchyard. The exact place still remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mermaid Title:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1947.jpeg&quot;/&gt;mernetwork     &lt;p&gt;The world is filled with beautiful girls all over the world who want to become real life princesses. And so, not missing the chance of becoming a mermaid, the world organizes a “Miss Mermaid” title for the one who deserves it every year. As much as it is dependent on the looks, it also takes care of the fact if the winner is really a mermaid at heart or not!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Real Life Mermaids Caught on Camera 2017","description":"Hundreds of years back, the seas were expected to cover up strange creatures; one of them being mermaids."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/0/429d974320c3476bb0ea7e6b7b1b2de0_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/0/46adb3ceef746bd8ae63e710847b57e0_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"5 Daily Habits That Reveal a Lot About Your Personality"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/0/380e55cc62154c319ec684be4b749f80_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Things You Didn’t Know About the Male Body"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
