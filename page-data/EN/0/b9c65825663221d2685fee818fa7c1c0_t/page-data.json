While that may be a problem for only ladies, dark circles really do hinder your appearance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dark circles can plague you face for a number of reasons. These could be related to stress, overworking yourself, fatigue, and a lack of sleep. However, some of them involve genes, too. But that isn’t our point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This article will be informing you about methods you can use to get rid of those dreaded dark circles. As if being an adult wasn’t stressful already, dark circles have taken over now. However, when there is life, there is hope. And we’re trying to show you exactly that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, let’s get into our course of action by enlightening you about some good ways to make sure dark circles go away. Without further ado, let’s begin!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Acceptance!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1334.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The first step to solve any problem is to of course, address the fact that the problem actually exists in the first place. Without acceptance, you’re pretty much denying that the problem is even there. Therefore, accepting the fact that you have dark circles under your eyes will help you take a more positive and effective approach towards the issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This will incline you towards finding a solution for the problem. However, if you’re not sure where to begin, getting enough sleep would be a good start.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Beauty Sleep!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1335.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Getting sufficient sleep is a very important part of trying to get rid of dark circles. While it isn’t really clear how a lack of sleep brings about dark circles, it makes the skin paler. This results in a clear appearance of darkness under your eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, taking off eye makeup can also prove to be beneficial as it would hinder your appearance as you grow older and make you seem more tired. Anyhow, try to get around 8 to 9 hours of sleep every night. 7 could work too. Try to figure out how many hours work for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to that, reduce alcohol and drug consumption as it is detrimental to the quality of your sleep. Instead of that, increase your vitamin intake. Otherwise, adrenal function reduces and you definitely do not want that. That would lead to a lessened absorption rate of B6, which will result in decreased adrenal gland function.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In shorter words, get enough sleep and sufficient nutrients. Try having some greens. That will solve most of your problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Try dealing with your allergies!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1336.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Allergies cause increased discoloration of the skin, increasing the appearance of dark circles. If you find yourself dealing with an allergy, try to treat it using over-the-counter medicines. Or, ask your medical physician to prescribe some for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re allergic to food items or a certain chemical, try staying away from those as much as possible. Talk to your skin specialist about how to deal with such an issue. Allergies can cause vitamin deficiency which just increases your problems. To avoid that, use multivitamins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gluten intolerance can also cause this. It is an allergy to wheat, barley, and rye. If you have celiac disease, have blood tests done. Try to get to the root of the problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, a nasal congestion can add to your issues. A blocked nose can be taken care of using a nasal spray or a neti pot. If you have a sinus related problem, make sure to consult your doctor as you may need antibiotics in this case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Take care of your diet.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1337.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Having a balanced diet can help you in many ways. A balanced diet consisting of vitamins and minerals in addition to plenty of water can aid a plethora of cosmetic issues.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Make sure you have a lot of vegetables and fruits. Focus particularly on cabbage, spinach, and more leafy green veggies. Also, reduce your salt intake as it can cause the body to retain water under the eyes. It’ll cause puffiness and also hinder blood circulation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Stop smoking!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1338.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;While it may be very difficult to go cold turkey, try to quit smoking as quickly as possible. It causes vascular issues that can make your blood vessels appear bluer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also the part about how it threatens YOUR LIFE. Seriously, though. Try to quit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Relaxing!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1339.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;What can’t a little relaxing solve? It reduces stress and other disorders that prevent you from leading a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Relaxing also helps your skin as it reflects changes in your body. A lack of stress will certainly affect it positively.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Use natural remedies.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1340.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Use natural remedies such as cucumber slices. These reduce puffiness and refresh your skin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The process is to keep a slice on each eye and lie down for 10-15 minutes with your eyes closed. If the slices are cool, it is much better, as they will cool your eyes, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You could also use tea bags and ice, wrapped in a cloth. Place them over your eyes and behold the magic. Tea bags play a part in reducing swelling and discoloration. Do the same thing you would with cucumber slices, and keep your eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another thing you could do is make a saline solution. There’s nothing a quarter teaspoon of salt and/or a half teaspoon of baking soda can’t solve. Add these in water and pour it down one nostril with your head tilted. The water will come out the other nostril and this will help you get rid of nasal congestion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or, take an uncooked potato and place it into a liquidizer. Scoop it out and place it over your eyelids. After 30 minutes, clean it with warm water. You can also use a frozen spoon placed on your eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vitamin E from almond oil also proves to be a useful agent in reducing dark circles. These remedies, coupled with exercise and meditation can really help reduce stress and boost your lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Cosmetic solutions.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1341.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;If all else fails for you, try going with cosmetic solutions. The first step would be to do a skin patch test. Trying figuring out which product is suitable for you as some might cause unwanted allergies and other side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use an eye cream that contains vitamin K and retinol. The deficiency of these might cause dark circles. This will reduce puffiness and bring back the color to your skin. A long term use would bring out the best effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can also use a concealer. Not just any concealer; use a peach or orange-tinted one. Balance out the tones under your eyes and apply it in an upside-down triangle shape. Use your ring finger and make sure you extend it to your cheekbones. Hit it with a touch of foundation and you’re good to go.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. You’re beautiful!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1342.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Using these methods can really help reduce and even totally banish dark circles from your eyes. Just make sure you are disciplined and motivated.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;However, if you cannot help having dark circles under your eyes, accept this fact as it is usually has to do with genetics. It could also be pigmentation issues, overexposure of the sun, facial structure, or even hormones. You are beautiful the way you are, which is why you should just accept these facts!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"How to Get Rid of Black Circles Under Your Eyes","description":"These tips are extremely useful and practical!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/0/b9c65825663221d2685fee818fa7c1c0_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/0/c1225a7a03e7e8c2d30749a0afc72970_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"5 Exercises to Test the Age of Your Body"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/0/b3bb240a44f26744b1ecc5eba7b7de70_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Historical Images You Just Have to See!"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
