This was captured in a very horrifying mobile phone footage in which the owner was shouting madly while he banged the grey hound on the floor after swinging it in the air.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Owner went on to say that he wants to cook the dog and relish the meat after cooking the dog.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The owner lost it&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-451.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Weibo &lt;p&gt;The video clip got very viral and 2.5 million viewers saw this really horrific act of the owner. It was a very disturbing sight to watch and the viewers condemned the act strongly. Many even claimed that the man is very ruthless after the video was uploaded on Weibo which is similar to the social networking website Twitter. One angry man even said that he should be slammed the same way he is doing with the dog.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;It is all about money&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-452.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Weibo &lt;p&gt;The man had spent a lot of money on the race and thus was very disappointed when he lost the money because the dog lost the race. So the owner decided to vent the frustration on the dog, and killed him so that he could feed on the meat. Although British greyhounds which are not fit for the race are being sold in China for almost Â£300,000 and are boiled alive so the meat could be used for cooking purposes. Kerry Elliman has taken up a campaign in which she has been able to rescue 758 grey hounds since the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;Dog race is banned in China&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-453.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Dog race is officially banned in China but because the Macau region is sovereign and is able to decide its own laws it has not placed a ban on the race as yet. On the Canidrome track 120 dogs are taking part in the 16 races being held five days a week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The owner killed the dog&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-454.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Weibo &lt;p&gt;In this case the owner was well aware as to what he was doing thus he continued to hit the dog until the dog died. He was continuously shouting at the dog and repeating that it was because of him he lost the money. Another person in the video who did not reveal his identity said that the owner had invested a lot of money in order to purchase the grey hound and make efforts to put the dog in to the race competition. He had also bet on the dog of heavy amounts and ended up losing it all since the dog could not win the race.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The irony of the fact is that he gave a message to the dog owners that if the dog does not look fit enough to join the race it should be eaten.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;No matter what happens but this brutal act should be questioned by the relevant authorities and should be stopped at all times.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Man Beats Greyhound to Death for Losing Money in a Dog Race","description":"The dog owner ended up beating his grey hound which caused its death because the owner lost his money in a dog race in China."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/0/52c15a5a8e378d753d5f8c8013e19300_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/0/540212e262e24baf382d0e6309cefad0_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Texts From Best Friends Who Are Always There to Assist."}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/0/4fcdc822dbd17d994f4cf204f0f9d0d0_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Makeup Trends That Went from Cringe to Cool"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
