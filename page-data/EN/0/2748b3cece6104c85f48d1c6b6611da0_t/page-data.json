It may even be a struggle for them to convey this information to family and friends. However, celebrities may find even this little privacy stripped away from them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hollywood stars certainly have a huge percentage of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals. However, not all of them are ready to come out as soon as they realize this fact about themselves. Still, many have been outed against their will either by careless coworkers or the paparazzi. Read on for some examples:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Portia De Rossi&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Ellen and Portia give us hope ‚ò∫ #gay #lesbian #married #gaymarriage #lovethem #homo #homosexual #inspiration #hope #gaycelebs #girlswholikegirls #ellendegeneres #portiaderossi&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by @gaycelebs on Aug 17, 2012 at 2:02pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Portia De Rossi is an actress in her own right, even though she is now more commonly known as the spouse of Ellen DeGeneres. Back in the day, De Rossi played a major role in the movie Scream 2. Since she made quite an impression on some, the tabloids couldn‚Äôt help but put some ‚Äòjournalists‚Äô on her trail. Or maybe we can just call them stalkers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When tailing de Rossi, the paparazzi managed to spot her with her girlfriend (not Ellen at the time). They even got some photographs of the couple. Of course, this was a highly unethical move. She thus had to come out even though she was not ready to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Michelle Rodriguez&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; It may be because of your character Or my will I am hypnotized by your smile I disarm your look why there&#39;s nothing left of me I melt Like an ice in the sun #michellerodriguez #mrod #mrodofficial #lettyortiz #mrsalpha #guapa #womencrush #forever&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by TeamMR üá™üá® (@mrodriguezccabello) on Dec 3, 2017 at 2:51pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rodriguez has been in several movies and series, including Lost and, most famously, The Fast and the Furious franchise. She is usually very comfortable with showing off her body. Plus, she is mostly paired off with male co-stars, so her sexuality may not have come under question much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, she has herself given somewhat misleading answers to the question of her sexuality. We can‚Äôt really blame her since the question itself is very invasive and we all should be entitled to our privacy. Whatever the case, she may have been shocked to discover herself listed as gay in a magazine article. The outing itself didn‚Äôt really cite its sources. Still, Rodriguez has since come out as bisexual. It may have been premature for her, but she had to give more precise details after that incident.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Anne Heche&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; I love this show! Love and Heche with Jason Ellis on Faction radio #siriusxm @wolfmate&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Anne Heche (@anneheche) on Nov 6, 2017 at 6:02pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heche had some very serious relationships with famous lesbian celebs before same-sex marriage was made legal in America. She never really came out herself, but these celebrities talking about her kind of made it evident.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These celebs included Ellen DeGeneres and Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell. Both of them mentioned Heche in interviews when they talked about their previous romantic interests. However, Heche is now in a heterosexual marriage and may not be comfortable with officially coming out. Of course, her being outed somewhat by the big stars may not be malicious on their part. Still, it may not be with her full consent. This just goes to show that when you run in the Hollywood world you have to be prepared to get a lot of attention. Some of that attention may be unwanted, but it‚Äôs yours all the same.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;4. Kristen Stewart&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Kristen Stewart (@kristenstewart___) on Jun 20, 2014 at 3:47pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stewart is quite a talented actress, even though her work may be overshadowed by the horrendous Twilight series. Even though not many like her in the role of Bella, one cannot deny that she is quite attractive. Her connection with Hollywood is enough for the paparazzi to not leave her alone, in any case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At first glance, Stewart does seem to lead a family heterosexual life. However, her other movie roles such as in The Runaways may give some hint about her sexuality. Still, her privacy was unforgivably invaded when photographers released a slew of pictures. These showed her with a girl in Hawaii in some pretty compromising positions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stewart was forced to comment on the resulting rumors and confirm her bisexuality. She did, however, speak up against the way her private life was being sold as a ‚Äòcommodity‚Äô. We can‚Äôt really disagree with her there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Neil Patrick Harris&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; We attended the @saks Holiday Window unveiling last night. The 14 Snow White inspired windows are spectacular, as was the first-rate light/projection/firework/production show staring the beautiful Snow White herself! Our family is finally feeling fully festive. #saksholiday&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Neil Patrick Harris (@nph) on Nov 21, 2017 at 5:13pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Who doesn‚Äôt love Neil Patrick Harris? He has been in the entertainment industry for quite some time. His performances have delighted us whether he was playing a child doctor or the goofy Barney. He probably carried the series How I Met Your Mother single-handedly to great fame. And this was when he wasn‚Äôt even the main character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, his sexuality was quite a private matter even though he had a long-term boyfriend. Some of you may remember said boyfriend as his best friend on the show Doogie Howser. Others may be more familiar with his character as Lily‚Äôs ex in HIMYM.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, Harris was actually outed before he was good and ready. This was mainly due to a whole load of rumors peddled by tabloids. He eventually came out on People magazine‚Äôs cover with regards to this aspect of his life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His statements about this question were quite clear, honest, and direct. He stated that he had been grateful for being in the public‚Äôs graces for so long. About the interest in his own life, he chose not to ignore the speculations and proudly came out. As many of us know, he and his partner adopted a twin boy and girl some years back. We are now very much impressed by his family‚Äôs Halloween costumes every year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Jodie Foster&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; #jodiefoster #carnage #gorgeous #hollywood #celebrity&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by jodie Foster (@_jodiefoster_) on Sep 15, 2013 at 4:04pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who have known Jodie Foster in her heyday might have had their suspicions about her sexuality. However, the star didn‚Äôt seem to have any plans for coming out if she had any say in it. Unfortunately, though, she was not given much of a choice. She did hold off for as long as possible, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This attitude of hers was probably not out of any sort of shame or guilt about who she was. The matter was simply that she was so caught up in being successful that she didn‚Äôt think her private life was anyone‚Äôs concern. Plus, coming out in Hollywood has a lot of social implications. Maybe she just didn‚Äôt want to be the center of any sort of drama.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, Out Magazine did invade her privacy publishing pictures of her and Anderson Cooper after the latter came out. There had already been rumors about Foster being gay, but the magazine titled the photo series The Glass Closet without her consent. We highly doubt they even took permission from her or interviewed her about this subject.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result of this outing, or maybe due to unrelated matters, Foster was not seen on the big screen so much. We find it hard to remember any recent movie that she has been in. however, she has taken the reins and somewhat come out on her own since that incident.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Lee Pace&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; When I was on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.üíô&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Lee Pace (@leeepfrog) on Oct 29, 2017 at 10:55am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of us know Ian McKellen as Gandalf, the wise old wizard in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. He is undoubtedly one of the best actors in these movies, and in several others too. He can be funny, serious, angry, and highly emotional. When he is out of character, though, he doesn‚Äôt look anything like the fantasy role he played. However, his role in Hollywood seems to extend to unwittingly outing his co-actors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an interview, McKellen was apparently rambling about gay actors in the acting industry. He should probably have been very careful with names, but he wasn‚Äôt. During the course of this interview, he listed Lee Pace along with Luke Evans and Stephen Fry as examples of gay actors. McKellen may not have realized that Pace was not officially out of the closet just then. This just goes to show that one can out someone who is gay and not even realize what they have done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obviously, working and moving in Hollywood circles would mean one is talked about in interviews, documentaries, etc. Still, privacy should be respected by the press and coworkers alike. In this case, however, one may say the slip-up was a genuine mistake.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Playing for the home team (or both) should really be a matter of one‚Äôs own business. Unfortunately for them, celebrities very rarely have the luxury of a completely private life. If their career is going well, they can expect the limelight to showcase their lives whether they want it or not.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"7 Gay Celebs Who Were Outed by Other Stars and 8 by the Paparazzi","description":"One‚Äôs sexuality is an extremely private thing, even if one isn‚Äôt a celebrity.
