The Titanic&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-166.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;We all know about the famous boat, be it from the movie or from the actual tragic events the picture of the majestic titanic is something to behold while it stayed afloat. This is a picture of the Titanic before it went under. Who would have thought?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Charlie Chaplin meets Hellen Keller:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-167.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Openculture &lt;p&gt;Wonder why this is a historical moment you just had to see? Well the greatest irony that was present when the two of some of the most renowned people in history met in 1919. Hellen was a deaf and blind political activist as well as an author while Charlie was a man who rose to fame by starring in the era of silent film. Guess irony never gets lost does it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Charlie the Lion:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-168.jpeg&quot;/&gt;IMAGE: BETTMANN/CORBIS &lt;p&gt;We all know about Harambe, but did you all know about Charlie the Lion? He was the Lion that was the roaring icon representing the media company of Metro-Goldwyn Mayer. The same Lion you see roaring just before Tom and Jerry starts. Feel like a major puzzle in your life being put into place? All of us do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. The Original Mount Rushmore:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-169.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;For those who don’t know what Mount Rushmore is, it is a is a sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore, a batholith in the Black Hills in Keystone, South Dakota, United States. Sculptor Borglum created the sculpture’s design and oversaw the project’s execution from 1927 to 1941 with the help of his son, Lincoln Borglum. It represents the 60 foot representations of 4 US presidents. This image of its first model only shows three. Want to guess which one was left out?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Hiroshima:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-170.jpeg&quot;/&gt;openculture &lt;p&gt;This is a rather gruesome one. Did you think that the atomic bomb that killed many in the tragic events that occurred in the Hiroshima and Nagasaki tragedy couldn’t get more gruesome? Well the image above shows the remains of the person who was sitting right there when this incident took place. The shadow on the stones are his remains for where he was sitting on the stairs before he directly received the rays of the deadly weapon.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;5. The partially excavated Sphinx:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-171.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Do you know about the Great Sphinx of Giza? Well it is a limestone statue of a reclining sphinx, a mythical creature with the body of a lion and the head of a human believed to be representing Pharaoh Khafre. The image above shows the before of the monument everyone travels oceans to look at now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Niagra falls and the Great freeze of 1911:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-172.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Niagra Falls Public Library  &lt;p&gt;Ever thought you would hear that Niagra falls didn’t gush as freely as it does now? Well the fun fact here is that it didn’t. During the Great Winter of 1911 the beautiful waterfall was nothing more than a frozen landscape, freezing the beautiful drops of the crystal blue water into a stand still picture of what it once was.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. John F. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-173.jpeg&quot;/&gt;oldpicz &lt;p&gt;Did you really think Kristen Stewart was the only one who could get caught on camera whilst having an affair? Well history and this particular image says otherwise as John F Kennedy and the former heart throb of the film industry are seen getting a bit too comfortable with each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. They definitely know how to celebrate:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-174.jpeg&quot;/&gt;pinterest &lt;p&gt;In 1933, the 21st Amendment to the Constitution was passed and ratified, ending national Prohibition. After the repeal of the 18th Amendment, some states continued Prohibition by maintaining statewide temperance laws. People were more than happy. The image shown above also shows how much they enjoyed celebrating it. Now we know overindulgence was passed down to its fullest extent here clearly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Especially for Hitler:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-175.jpeg&quot;/&gt;rarehistoricalphotos     &lt;p&gt;The unloved and the unforgotten. We all have flowers that can have our names on it, chocolates and well some unlucky ones have bullets with their name on it, but have you ever had an ammo with your name on it? Especially an Ammo wishing you a Happy Easter? Well if this was a game of ‘Never have I ever’, we all know Hitler would be the one taking a shot, literally.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Historical Images You Just Have to See!","description":"Are you a fan or history?
