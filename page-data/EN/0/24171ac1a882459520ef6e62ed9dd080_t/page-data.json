But, before he can move on to world destruction he’s faced with the challenge of adopting three orphan girls, who want him as a father they’ve never had! Now, who would have thought it would be such a great hit? The movie released in 2010 and has fans all over the world. From merchandise to sequels, the movie is a great hit internationally! But, the fun doesn’t stop there. Believe it or not, there are some real-life people that are a total copy of your beloved character. So, let’s get into it I can’t wait to see what a real life Gru is going to look like!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Agnes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2280-2-gif.gif&quot;/&gt;giphy &lt;p&gt;Probably one of the most adorable characters and the youngest of three sisters, Agnes is a six-year-old cutie with dark brown eyes and dark brown hair, tied upwards on the top of her hair with a red scrunchie ad wears denim overalls, with a yellow t-shirt and some comfy white sneakers. Agnes is voiced by Elsie Fisher, who was only 7 years-old while working on the first Despicable movie, no wonder there was such a cuteness overload. She loves her fluffy unicorns and making friends. She even manages to make friends with Gru’s vicious pet dog. Now, like all children her age, she knows exactly how to get what she wants and it usually involves holding her breath till she gets what she desires.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Agnes from Despicable Me!http://www.costume-works.com/agnes_from_despicable_me.html&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Posted by Costume-Works.com on Thursday, October 24, 2013&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now you might think finding a real-life Agnes might be next to impossible, but you’re wrong. This adorable toddler is nothing short of her twin! From the hair to the outfit, everything is on point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Edith&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2280-3-gif.gif&quot;/&gt;giphy &lt;p&gt;Edith is one of those characters that you can’t help but adore. This nine-year-old sure does have a lot of spunk. She has blond hair and blue eyes and can be seen rocking a pink beanie and a pink sweater, a purple skirt, purple leggings and some snow boots. Such a fashion icon at such a young age I must say. Let’s not forget Edith has some of the funniest one-liners and her level of sarcasm is off the charts. Dana Geyer did an amazing job being the voice of Edith and really captured the essence of her character, Edith is probably the most pessimistic of the bunch but the most daring and fun. Although she has some reservations about Gru, he manages to win her heart in the end.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; 😂 just so alike ❤ my niece #niece #lydia #edithagnesmargo #edithdespicableme #despicableme #cute #laughter #loveher&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Hannah Shaw (@hannajade_xxx) on Feb 11, 2016 at 3:36pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, if you want to look like Edith, it’s actually quite simple. Check out this cutie-pie, who manages to get the Edith look just right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Margo&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2280-4-gif.gif&quot;/&gt;giphy &lt;p&gt;The eldest of the three sisters is Margo and just like every elder sister she is very protective of her younger siblings. She’s witty and sarcastic and can out-smart just about anyone in her way. Margo is voiced by the ever so talented Miranda Cosgrove of iCarly. Nothing gets by Margo! Being the eldest she was always careful about Gru and made sure she could trust him and eventually she does. If you want to get the Margo look you have to have brown shiny hair tied up in a ponytail, a rocking black t-shirt with a white shirt underneath, a plaid skirt, some red sneakers and a brown jacket to tie the whole look together. And, don’t forget about the glasses!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lucy Wilde and Margo from &amp;quot;Despicable me 2&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Posted by Jules Gudkova on Tuesday, August 15, 2017&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Check out this Deviant Artist, who goes by the name Homo Bernardus, decided to dress up as Margo for her cosplay, and we have to admit she did an amazing job!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lucy Wilde&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2280-6-gif.gif&quot;/&gt; giphy &lt;p&gt;The next Despicable Me character is probably one of the most interesting characters in the movie, Lucy Wilde, but she doesn’t make an appearance until the second movie. Lucy wild is a red-head bombshell with gorgeous green eyes, she wears a long blue jacket, with a blue dress and strappy white heels. Her killer looks definitely get the attention of Gru as they start to date in the movie and eventually get married. But plot twist, she’s actually a spy on a mission to capture Gru, which I guess she does, just not in the way she was supposed to. It turns out that Gru and she have a lot in common and can’t help but to fall in love! Looks like the girls get their perfect family after all. Lucy Wilde is voiced by the hilarious Kristen Wiig, who seems to be a perfect match for Lucy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2280-5-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Tumblr &lt;p&gt;Check out this hot mama, who nailed the Lucy Wilde look right down to the strappy white heels. Cosplayers really know how to step up their game!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Vector&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2280-7-gif.gif&quot;/&gt;giphy &lt;p&gt;Let’s add some villains to the mix! A man with direction and magnitude, Vector, now don’t get it twisted these are his words, not ours. Vector is a hilarious character and although he’s a villain, you can’t help but like him! Through-out the movie he tries to ruin Gru’s plans but somehow everyone just seems to out-smart him, including the three adorable sisters. Unlike Gru, who had a rather tough upbringing, Vector is a spoiled brat who got everything handed to him on a silver plate. Trying to re-create Vector’s look might be kind of tough. You’ll never catch him without his ridiculous orange tracksuit, his goofy glasses and his bowl haircut. Vector is voiced by Jason Segel, no wonder you can’t seem to hate on him, he’s voiced by one of the most lovable actors out there! We love us some Jason and oh yes, some Vector as well.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Hey guys💦💦 this is my son vectar he&#39;s just like me so any ladies out there hit him up🍆🍆💦💦💦🍆🍆🍆&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Hey Im VECTOR (@thatguyfromdespicableme) on Apr 25, 2017 at 9:13am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s give a round of applause to this cosplayer from Germany, Sherry81 who managed to pull this look off! We can’t help but wonder where she got that orange tracksuit from, as she looks amazing in it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Miss Hattie&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2280-8-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Universal Pictures &lt;p&gt;If you’re having trouble remembering Miss Hattie, let me catch you up to speed with this gloomy character. Miss Hattie makes her appearance in the first Despicable Me movie as the owner of the orphanage where Agnes, Edith, and Margo stayed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2280-9-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Tumblr &lt;p&gt;Now, she isn’t the friendliest of characters and seems to resemble of the Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, Professor Delores Umbridge from Hogwarts. The similarities in their fashion sense make them look like sisters! Although no cosplayer has ever recreated Miss Hattie and we’re not surprised, you can still give it a go. All you will need is a long purple plaid skirt, with a pink top and some heels. You will also need some hairspray to get that 60s hairdo and don’t forget an all-around foul attitude.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Gru&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2280-10-gif.gif&quot;/&gt;giphy &lt;p&gt;Ans who can forget about the star of the show, Gru a self-proclaimed villain, who plans on stealing the moon, all in the name of proving a point. His funky gadgets and intriguing accent make him quite likable even though he calls himself a villain. Now, we all know what the typical Gru fashion is, a grey turtleneck sweater, with a chic scarf and black skinny jeans to complete the look.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2280-11-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;He’s played by the hilarious and ever so talented Steve Carrel, who decided he would dress up as Gru in real life and even had a very interesting interview on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. We must give a hat off to Mr. Steve Carrel he really is the true Gru, he’s got the outfit down just right!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Dr. Nefario&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2280-12-gif.gif&quot;/&gt;giphy &lt;p&gt;The brains behind Gru’s wacky gadgets, Dr. Nefario is a scientist who has the most amazing accent and charming personality. Gru refers to him as his sidekick but we think he just likes inventing stuff. There were a lot of rumors floating around saying that Dr. Nefario might be Gru’s father. But, that rumor was quickly put to rest after we saw that Gru’s father’s name was Robert. Now, if you want to recreate Dr. Nefario in real life you need to get your hands on a doctor’s coat, some wicked googles, a pair of gloves, black pants and a trusty portable mobility scooter. You’re going to also want to work on that accent and get busy in the lab creating stuff. After you find yourself a Gru, voila, you are a real-life Dr. Nefario!&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; #Gru and #drnefario at the party @jockbray #despicableme #minions. 💜💚 #fancydress photocredit @bexblakey&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Stephanie Kirk-Bray (@blueeyes1076) on Mar 12, 2017 at 9:52am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Check out this awesome costume of Dr. Nefario with his Minion, how cute!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Minions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2280-13-gif.gif&quot;/&gt;giphy &lt;p&gt;The minions are one of the most popular characters in the world and were first introduced to the three sisters as Gru’s cousins, but through-out the movie they became so much more than that! They’re cute, obnoxious and mischievous to say the least. Not to mention that there are over a thousand of them, voiced by the same person, Pierre Coffin. They also have their own language which no one can understand but seems to make a lot of sense. The love for these little characters have grown so much than that, they even have their own movie out! Now it might be hard to dress like an actual minion in real-life but there are plenty of costumes out there on the market. So, go on and grab your costume and show us your best minion impression.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; baaaaaanana 🍌 happy halloween! 👻🎃&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by C 🌹 (@irisenee) on Oct 30, 2015 at 9:55pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Look how adorable these two boys look in their minion costumes, they almost look like as cute as the minions from the movie. We are literally gushing over these minions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;All the Despicable Me Characters Together&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2280-14-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Los Angeles Film School via Pinterest     &lt;p&gt;Here’s a great idea for you and your family, why not spend the day together creating your own Despicable Me character costumes and putting on a play for your family! That way you can spend some quality time with your family while working on your acting skills. Check out Annie’s family portrait with all the Despicable Me characters in one picture! There’s Gru, Vector, Margo and Edith, all that’s missing are the minions and Dr. Nefario but, we are sure they are somewhere hiding in the house as they rarely like to their home. Annie was so motivated to get her family to play along, that her husband even shaved his head to make himself look more like Gru! This family certainly knows how to pay attention to details. You might think this might be a crazy idea for your family, but give it a go, we’re sure your family will love it and we have to say of all the Despicable Me characters, this one has got to take the win. After all, the movie is based on family values and love for one another.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 DESPICABLE ME Characters in Real Life","description":"A look at 10 Despicable Me characters in real life."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/0/24171ac1a882459520ef6e62ed9dd080_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/0/251cb33ab82d77861913d9f79ac58070_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"19 Makeup Hacks Every Female Should Know For That Flawless Finish"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/0/1315088dd78ed1d3f1275694d4100520_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"5 Products You'll Never Eat Once You Know What They're Made Of!"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
