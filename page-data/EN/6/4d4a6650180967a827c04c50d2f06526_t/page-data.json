It’s about a young girl who joins the ultimate tech company named; The Circle. As she proceeds with her career, she learns about the downsides of this amazing career as well and the long-held secrets of the company. The company provides unlimited snacks, health insurance coverage even after retirement, your personal problems are taken care of, they offer to help you achieve your goals and you are treated as a family and you feel like one too while you are working there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Almost anyone would love to work at a place like that. Wouldn’t you? \\But nothing my friend comes free of cost even if the workplace you are working at is as ideal as this one. There is always a price associated with everything. When you are sacrificing your priorities in life to work, it’s not so ideal. Sounds familiar? Well, here is a list of 5 signs that indicate you might be stuck in a toxic work environment without realizing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Choosing Work over Family and Friends&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1097.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;It is definitely an awesome thing to have fabulous coworkers that you get along with really well but if they turn into your family and friends even outside of work, that’s a red flag. There is a life outside the work and you need to live that. If you are constantly canceling your personal commitments because of work, you need to rethink your workplace choice. Cancelling a dinner date because your boss has asked you to prepare a presentation last minute, missing a family event because someone at work is hospitalized are a few examples of a not so healthy workplace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Work Dictates Whether you are Happy or Cranky&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1098.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;We all know that if your happiness depends on validation of others, it’s not really a great thing. Even when it comes to working. If you are happy when you are praised for work and are cranky when you are not, you need to think about your choices. If screwing up a single task at work or not performing your best at a single meeting makes you cranky and rude to the people in your personal life, it is a huge indicator of a toxic workplace.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;3. Sleep Gets Affected&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1099.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;For most of us, our sleep gets affected when we are excited or tensed. If you are constantly thinking about the deadlines, the behavior of your boss and peers with you at a particular day, pleasing your authorities or about a presentation you have to get in front of your coworkers and that limits you from sleeping of focusing on the things that you love, you need to rethink that whether the workplace is affecting you for the better or the worse. Moreover, lack of sleep makes your life harder; at work and personally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. The Only Thing You are Thinking About is Work&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1100.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;You need to unplug. It’s absolutely necessary. If you are on a vacation, having dinner with your loved ones, attending a birthday party or going clubbing, but all you are thinking about is the work that needs to be done at the office, something is seriously toxic. You are overdoing it. There is a reason why there is a personal and professional life. Both need to be separated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Your Desk Resembles a Camp&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1101.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;What does an average desk of a person at the office look like? It usually has a water bottle, a few extra pens, maybe a journal and that’s about it. Now, examine your desk, if it looks more like a camping spot and less like an office desk. Now, what is excessive? You might be wondering to yourself. Well, if you have an outfit or two, toiletry bags, extra makeup, extra meals. All these things are showing an obsession with work and are an indicator that your life typically revolves around your work schedule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What to do?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If this post has given you a reality check and you are thinking what you need to do right now. Here is what you need to identify the red flags first. The common ones are enlisted in the post but feel free to recognize others. Once you identify the problem. It’s your call to decide whether you want to talk to your peers about it or want to look for another organization who promote a work-life balance culture. Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;If you have ever faced anything like that and have gotten out of the toxic environment, we would love to know your experiences.
