Well, it’s not because the original Santa wanted to look like a candy cane. Surprisingly, it’s because the entire Santa theme is based around one of today’s juggernauts in the branding world for example Coca Cola. In 1931, the company stationed Michigan-born illustrator Haddon Sundblom as head of the campaign for introducing the modern-day Santa Claus; who was meant to be a sales executive promoting the sale of gifts and presents all over the world around Christmas time. The color schemes and branding of Coca Cola immaculately aligns with that of Santa Claus, and that’s how branding helps to shape trends all over the globe. There are quite a few examples of company logos possessing a hidden story which not everyone knows about. Here are some of the companies you must have heard about and the hidden secrets inside their logos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10) APPLE&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-201.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest companies in the world in terms of product sales, annual revenue generation and market reputation. It may seem they did not pay much heed to their logo. Well, to the naked eye it may seem like it. But if you ask the actual illustrator himself, Rob Jannof, it isn’t that simple. The science behind the logo originated in Jannof’s work space. In 1977 he bought a bag of apples in order to replicate an apple in one of his sketches. It took him hours to figure out how to differentiate an apple from looking like a cherry. Eventually, he added a bite mark to the apple and stumbled across the similarity between a ‘bite’ and a ‘byte’. This is how the iconic apple logo came into existence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9) TOYOTA&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-202.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Toyota is one of the leaders in automobile manufacturing globally, but what is its logo based on? Well, if you pay attention to the formation of the logo you will find all of the letters in the name ‘TOYOTA’ are present in the logo. From the looks of it, the logo seems like it may represent a bull or a cowboy with a hat. Well, to the contrary, it represents a needle and string. Bet you would have never thought of that. This is because this Japanese car manufacturer initially began doing business under the name ‘TOYODA” and sold weaving machines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8) VAIO&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-203.jpeg&quot;/&gt;google.com &lt;p&gt;A subsidiary of Sony that manufactures computers or laptops, there was a lot of thought put into VAIO’s logo. The first two letters in the company’s name represents a digital wave form and the last two letters were meant to look like a 1 and a 0 presenting the notion of a fusion between analog and digital. The start-up melody of a VAIO computer is actually the sound derived from a keypad dial tone when typing the letters V-A-I-O.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7) HYUNDAI&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-204.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;A South Korean car manufacturer that focuses on high-terrain vehicles and trucks has a rather simplistic and symbolic secret behind its logo. On the surface, it may look like just the first letter of the company i-e ‘H’. But it’s actually much more than that. Upon magnifying our gazes we will find that it’s actually a representation of two figures; a Hyundai salesman shaking hands with a happy customer. This cleverly projects the underlying vision of the company. It shows how much the company values its clients as well as its employees. It may also look like the scene of a successful sale or purchase. These are two solid theories about the Hyundai logo. You can go with either one when you tell your friends, they’re both sound.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6) CONTINENTAL&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-205.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;A large scale tire manufacturing company that supplies wheels for a large chunk of the world’s vehicle count. The story behind its logo is quite simple yet accurate at the same time. The first two letters of the logo are meant to imitate a car wheel.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;5) Amazon&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-206.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The company that revolutionized shopping by making it seamlessly easy through the use of technology, Amazon is one of the top 5 companies in the world in terms of dollar worth. Its vision is based on customer satisfaction and that phenomenon is evident in the logo. The logo represents a smile which depicts the intent of making everyone happy and satisfying customers. Along with that, the arrow also starts with ‘a’ and ends with ‘z’ implying that the company stocks every possible consumer good present in the market. There is nothing out there that you will not find on amazon. You can try it, it’s true!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4) Toblerone&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-207.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;One of the oldest vintage chocolate manufacturing companies, Toblerone is a Swiss company which carries out its production operations in Bern, Switzerland. The picture of a mountain on the Toblerone box isn’t just another mountain, it’s a picture of the Swiss Alps. The picture however, also hides a bear in it because Bern is known as the city of bears. If you’ve never noticed it before, go out and grab a Toblerone and try to locate it on your own. Once you know it’s there it becomes pretty obvious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3) BMW&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-208.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The ultimate representative of a car with class is a BMW. This German manufacturer began manufacturing aircrafts in 1916 slowly transforming into a mega car manufacturer. Many think that the checkered pattern in its logo is actually a depiction of the spinning propellors of an aircraft. But in reality it is just a design copied from the Bavarian flag. Bavaria is the part of Germany where the company originated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2) DOMINO’S PIZZA&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-209.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;In 1960, college dropout Tom Monichan borrowed $1900 in order to buy his own pizza place which went by the name of Dominic’s Pizza. Five years later he bought two more stores in separate locations in search of business expansion. The former owner however, refused Tom the permission to use his name in the franchise. Tom didn’t stop there though. He changed the name to ‘Domino’s Pizza’ and constructed a new logo. The dice in the logo represent the first restaurant he bought followed by the next two. He hoped to add on to those numbers in the dice on every new opening. Little did he know how much success would come his way. So, that idea eventually fell over as he couldn’t have anticipated the speed at which the restaurant’s popularity would grow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1) UNILEVER&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-210.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;If you don’t know who or what exactly is Unilever, all you have to do is get a hold of ‘AXE’ the deodorant and read the details on the back of the product. You will find the unilever logo hiding there. Unilever is a conglomerate that manufactures more than 400 consumers goods. Goods that are entire brands in their own right. The actual Unilever logo is made up of 25 other intricate logos, each with a rich meaning.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;So, when you see all these uniquely assembled logos of all the big companies don’t think that it’s just there. It’s pretty easy to say that they’re meaningless and it’s all about what the company is selling rather than what they represent. But on a serious note, these companies don’t just do things just because. There is heaps and bounds of deliberation and calculation that goes into each and every decision they make. A company that cannot depict its vision in the logo that is supposed to represent its identity isn’t really doing its job right. Upon research, you will find that even the 24/7 store around the corner has spent time designing an identity for the business as a whole. A logo is the first step towards formulating that identity into the best version of company values and&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Secrets Hidden Inside Famous Logos","description":"Famous companies and their identities"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/6/011316eed4b230fce892240e12464a56_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/6/09f9d79304b023cace42e9ade2f99a96_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"11 Things That Will Happen Once Queen Elizabeth Dies"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/5/fb033e162d3e46de12e852d49716ace5_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"17 Signs That Will Help You Spot a Person Who Is Secretly Jealous of You"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
