Not too often. Each day, we face the same old boring teachers, mingle with the same old classmates, and tolerate the same old lunch meals (barely). Is there really anything to look forward to?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;School is barely excitable to anyone. Having said that, there are a few things that can make school an enjoyable place. In this case, we look at teachers who think outside the box and step aside from the usual grouchy role they’re in. These are some extremely creative individuals who have taken to making school a fun place for their students. So, without further ado, let’s get right into it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1: “YOU SHALL NOT PASS!”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2179-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur.com &lt;p&gt;This teacher right here has a special and light-hearted way of grading papers. Not only was the student given a big fat ‘F’, they were also welcomed with a stamp of Lord of The Rings character Gandalf shouting “You shall not pass!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A very famous line from a very famous movie, the teacher has used it to perfection in this situation. We can’t imagine what an A grade student would get on his paper!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2: Happy Halloween!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2179-2-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;piximus.net &lt;p&gt;These awesome teachers dressed up in the best way possible for Halloween. Not only did they wear fancy Harry Potter costumes, but they also struck some wicked moves!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking at the costumes, one can see that they spent a decent amount of money on them, along with the props. Props to them! How many Harry Potter characters can you identify?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3: Enough of Comic Sans!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2179-3-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur.com &lt;p&gt;Comic Sans is a very boring and frankly infuriating font, at times. Okay, who are we kidding; it has always been an annoying font.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One particular teacher expressed their problems with such fonts when they voiced their opinions on the whiteboard. The rules are clearly stated and if they are not followed, the teacher has promised to set that particular paper on fire; a very innovative and creative way of making sure the rules are followed. Kudos to such teachers!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4: The Math Mobile.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2179-4-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur.com &lt;p&gt;This fabulous math teacher designed a license plate that says ‘Algebro.’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not only is that brilliant, but it is quite refreshing to see a math teacher living up to their profession. Moreover, we are not going to pass up this opportunity to appreciate the greatness of the pun that has been used. It is truly terrific! We’d like to call this vehicle the ‘Math Mobile.’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5: The Biology Teacher who shoots straight.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2179-5-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur.com &lt;p&gt;This biology has clearly had enough with students acting silly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They really nailed it with this amazingly written fact, that we are in fact the result of a 3.8 billion evolutionary process, and we must act like it. You don’t expect silliness from a species that has been under development for such a long time. And to imagine we would have known our stuff by now. Who’d have thought?!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6: The most punctual professor ever!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2179-6-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur.com &lt;p&gt;Talk about punctuality. This professor right here does not accept late assignments at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, they won’t even listen to your excuses. As one can see, there is a special place designated for late assignments. They may be accepted, but not by the professor! Such a smart teacher always manages to encourage students to submit homework on time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7: The Attention Seeker.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2179-7-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur.com &lt;p&gt;We don’t think we’ve ever come across such a smart professor ever. In order to grab the students’ attention and inform them of a quiz, the respective email reads that Taylor Swift is giving away free tickets to her concert in its subject.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once it is opened, the details of the quiz can be found, much to the fondness of the professor and the dismay of the students. We wonder what Taylor Swift has to say about this!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8: The Spy Teacher!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2179-8-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur.com &lt;p&gt;Schools, universities, and other educational institutes have applied a lot of methods to erase the possibility of cheating and copying on an exam or test, such as spreading out the desks, making different versions of the test, and other more innovative methods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This method, however, is probably the best of them all. Not only is it creative, it also reduces the chance of cheating by a high percentage. Students are made to wear boxes on their heads that limit their vision and prevent them from turning their heads. We suspect this idea was the brainchild of a former spy. Quite brilliant!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9: The Book Angel of Death.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2179-9-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur.com &lt;p&gt;Submitting books beyond the due date has to be one of the things that get on a librarian’s nerves the most. In order to make sure that people return books on time, this librarian has taken to dressing up as an angel and going around collecting books like an angel would collect souls.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Not only is this idea awesome, it also shows the lighter side of things and proves that no situation cannot be improved without a little bit of humor! Why couldn’t all of us have a librarian like that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10: The Understanding One.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2179-10-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wimp.com &lt;p&gt;This lecturer shows great understanding with her students.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She should have added a picture of food, but since students did not approve of that since it made them hungry and impatient, she instead decided to go for a witty caption. Not only do these things promote a healthy atmosphere, they also keep the students interested in the subject.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11: Professor Dracula.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2179-11-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur.com &lt;p&gt;Dracula used to drink the blood any human who crossed his path.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This professor has funnily labeled his water bottle with a piece of paper that says ‘students’ tears’. We have no words for this absolute brilliance. He shoots it straight and admits quite proudly that teachers sometimes do drink our blood with the amount of homework they give. At last, someone who understands our pain!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12: Phone Wars!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2179-12-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;izismile.com &lt;p&gt;A sign outside a classroom depicts Darth Vader from the movie Star Wars. What it reads is the best thing one will ever come across today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order to justify the confiscation of phones, this sign claims that Vader’s teacher took his legs, let alone his phone. So, the pain you feel is nothing compared to the pain he felt. Consider yourself lucky!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13: The Teacher who is always present.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2179-13-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur.com &lt;p&gt;In order to supervise the class in her absence as well, this teacher sent a slide of her sitting on a chair and looking like she means business.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This spectacular professor indicates that whether she might be absent or present; she is not to be trifled with!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14: A piece of art!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2179-14-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;tumblr.com &lt;p&gt;This teacher here was done with people writing on the walls. Instead of telling them off like every time, they decided to attach a piece of paper on the wall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This paper was complete with all the details of the graffiti and even had a small amount printed underneath it as if it was for auction. In this scenario, the teacher and their idea is the piece of art.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15: The best yearbook photo ever.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2179-15-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur.com &lt;p&gt;We usually hear of students nailing yearbook photos with their witty poses and smart captions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this case, however, an English teacher took the cake as he posed with a little bird on his finger. His expression is quite sublime and so is the whole picture. Undoubtedly, it is the best yearbook photos ever taken!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;16: The Troll!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2179-16-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur.com &lt;p&gt;Don’t you just hate it when you have a really important question and the professor isn’t present in their room?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The professor, in this case, lived up to this dilemma faced by students and hung up a massive poster of himself working on his door. From the poster, one would think that he is actually sitting inside. Opening the door, however, would make you meet your least favorite site ever. What a genius!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;17: A word of advice!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2179-17-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;jokeitup &lt;p&gt;We all love it when our teachers motivate us, but when they use some of the more unconventional ways, it just lights us up even more!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A student walked in to see this picture on the screen. It surely says a thousand words, and wise ones too!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;18: Teachers – our mentors.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2179-18-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Regardless of how boring or entertaining one might think their teachers might be, they play a huge role in shaping our lives and careers. They correct our mistakes and influence our personalities and make sure we are on the right path. Which is why we should always respect our teachers and be of utmost gratitude to them!&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;But if you have a teacher that is this creative, well, you have all the more reason to respect them more. It is always refreshing to see teachers sharing their lighter side with their students. It opens up new dimensions, eases up the atmosphere, and eventually results in a better educational experience. So, respect your teachers and love them, regardless of what you might think of them!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"19 Incredibly Inventive Teachers Whose Classes No One Dares to Miss","description":"Teachers aren't always known to have a light-hearted side.
