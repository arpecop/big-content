They are also famed for hardly getting enough time for even a shower. It is hence no surprise that some ingenious parents have found various shortcuts to make their lives easier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They say that necessity is the mother of invention. The parenting shortcuts below serve to illustrate this saying in a hilarious manner. Some images may just show how parenting can have several weird and even risky moments:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. The Swaddling Dad&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-756.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Splitpics.uk &lt;p&gt;Stock pictures usually give a feeling of perfection. This could be difficult to imitate in real life. However, this dad seems to be doing just fine with a long piece of cloth wrapped around himself and the baby. Incidentally, this also leaves his hands free to take a selfie. The baby doesn’t seem to mind the situation at all! This just goes to show that one doesn’t need a potentially expensive way to hold their baby close to them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. The Last-Minute Stocking&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-757.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© akantho / reddit.com  &lt;p&gt;When kids grow up and leave home, they may not always be included in every single tradition. If they are, it’s understandable that their inclusion is a bit rushed. Take, for instance, these beautiful personalized Christmas stockings. The little white sock with a Post-It for the name is an obvious afterthought. The parents apparently wanted to include their grown-up daughter but chose to take the easy way out. We hope she didn’t feel any less loved, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. As Long as it Works&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-758.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© Fetisov / pikabu.ru  &lt;p&gt;Parents, especially mothers, may spend hours watching videos on various hairdos for their little girls. However, in real life, it’s not always easy or simple to get your little princess’s hair under control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this picture, the girl’s father probably couldn’t find a real hair tie anywhere. They do seem to vanish into black holes, don’t they? So he grabbed the nearest thing that could do the job. In this case, it was one of those plastic zip ties we use for sealing bags, etc. Needless to say, this girl’s hair is now firmly in place. We wonder if they were able to find a pair of scissors to let her hair down again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. How to Bottle Feed Twins&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-7.png&quot;/&gt;© dickfromaccounting / reddit.com  &lt;p&gt;What’s more difficult than feeding a baby every few hours? Feeding two or more, of course? A mother of twins came up with this handy trick after her twins developed severe acid reflux. They had to be fed every single hour and burped after every ounce of milk. If this routine was neglected, they would probably throw up everything they took in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the mother had no outside help, she came up with this ingenious way of making sure her twinnies were fed and supported. Those bendy hands clipped onto her headboard and easily held a bottle. The pillow is sold especially for nursing twins, into which these tots fit very comfortably. We’ve all propped up a bottle on a baby when we needed a breather. This mom sure deserves a round of applause and all the rest she can get.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. One Little Stray&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-759.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© GuyFromVault / reddit.com  &lt;p&gt;Anyone who has ever taken care of a kid knows that you can’t turn your back on them. In a few seconds, they could get into some really deep trouble. The couple here may not be bad parents, but their child is doing his best to prove otherwise. He’s climbed up almost to the first heaven!&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Now if only we can get a picture of their expressions when they realize where he is! Of course, he may be one of those kids who are experts at climbing everywhere. So they may not be too surprised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Clean Finger Painting&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-760.jpeg&quot;/&gt;cocoro.tv &lt;p&gt;Sounds like an oxymoron, doesn’t it? However, some very smart parents have found a way to keep their toddler entertained without making a mess. At the same time, he could also learn to play with and explore colors!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All they did was put some pain in ziplock bags and hang them where the child could smear his hands all over the bags. The paint would respond to the touch, but hopefully stay inside the bag. Here’s hoping the bags don’t burst! The only drawback to this idea is probably that the baby couldn’t mix the colors. However, mixing would probably just lead to a brown mess anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Upside Down Meal&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-761.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© thegreatbarcia / reddit.com  &lt;p&gt;It’s never easy going out to eat with kids. Hey, it isn’t easy feeding them at home either. However, kids do have a propensity to become very embarrassing in public. Case in point; the little girl who has her feet in the air at a restaurant. Her food looks quite appetizing, but maybe she doesn’t think so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, her father does seem to have stayed calm enough to snap this moment. When kids get to be like this, it’s usually best to let all quirks and tantrums run their course. We do hope she managed to get herself the right side up and finish her delicious meal!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. The Everyday Superhero&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-762.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© saraboulos / reddit.com  &lt;p&gt;When it comes to protecting their kids, parents rarely leave any stone unturned. Their offspring may be immersed in their phones, but it is their mothers and father that keep an eye on their safety. This image of a man saving his son from a rogue baseball bat is the perfect example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone else around the duo is trying to save themselves. Not so the man with his son, who happens to be right in the way of that flying weapon. Instead of covering his own face, he’s reaching out to protect the son. From the looks of it, the young boy was probably too interested in the device in his hands to protect himself. Never fear, Super Dad is here! Otherwise, that flying bat could really have done some serious damage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. A Real Earful&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-763.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© mm620 / reddit.com  &lt;p&gt;When this little boy told his father he wanted to be an ear for Halloween, he may not have been serious. Nevertheless, his awesome parent rose to the challenge and made his on the biggest ear on earth! This photo is proof of it. The happy and proud smile on the kid’s face is a testament to how much he appreciates it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, our favorite part is the accessory. Not every parent would have gone the extra mile even if they had made an ear costume. What better to complement an ear than a Q-tip? That part of the costume just makes it all the more remarkable in our opinion. He would have been prepared to duel with the conventional magic wands and swords his peers would have been carrying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. A Little Space&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Posted by Amazing Ideas on Wednesday, November 22, 2017&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes children make unreasonable demands of us. They may want pony rides when their parents have a bad back. Or they may simply want a bit of space to sit in an already impossibly small seat. When a parent has work to do, they try to make their kids happy along with fulfilling their own goals. The way out here may not always be obvious. However, one can usually expect a parent to find it in some manner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The image here is a prime example of compromise that benefits the parent. The girl presumably asked for a little space on the seat. The father, being a grown adult, couldn’t really manage that without one or both of them falling off the chair. The result? He sat his daughter behind him and got on with his computer work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this compromise, the kid can’t say that he didn’t fulfill her wishes. However, she does seem just about ready to let him have a piece of her mind.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;We’re sure many parents and babysitters would relate to these pictures. When dealing with the little folk, it’s all right to cut corners every now and then. However, these pictures also show that you sometimes have to take the bad with the good when parenting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Cool Parents Who Learned to Take Everything Easy","description":"Parents are usually among the most exhausted beings on earth.
