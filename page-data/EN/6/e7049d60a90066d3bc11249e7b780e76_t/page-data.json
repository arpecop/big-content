Many scientists have been working with NASA and few working independently devoted their lives to find clues regarding their existence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than half of our world no longer believe in alien existing in this universe. The best argument they come up with is that “if aliens are there in space, why didn’t they communicate with us?”. Well may be they have already landed on our earth and living with us on this planet without us knowing. We have listed some suspected alien hideouts on earth that scientists approved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. The Pacific Ocean:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-455.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;People think that humanity has explored each and every corner of earth. Ask this question from a traveler or a sailor, he will surely tell you about the Pacific Ocean, if not any other place. More that 70% of our earth is covers underwater and the Pacific Ocean is the largest and the deepest among the water bodies on earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those of you who do not know how deep The Pacific is; well it is 7 miles deep where it finally ends at the Mariana Trench. We have explored only the upper layer of this gigantic ocean.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mysterious thing which makes it the foremost candidate of being an alien hideout is the humming sound that the scientists have been recording since the year 1991. At 54°S and 140°W, right at the center of South Pacific Ocean the hums are often considered as the sound produced by either the whales or the tectonic plates. But the thing that tilt it in the favor of being an hideout is that the sound’s frequency is identical to “comet” 64P which is an unearthly sound.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Tonto National Forests, Arizona:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-456.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The 5th largest national forest in the world is situated in the United States of America. Is covers almost three million acres of land. The scenic beauty of the forest is what attracts the tourists to at least visit it once. But the question is that how can aliens hide in such a beautiful place? Even though the forest is open majorly for the public to visit but dense pine trees and the crazy elevations can help anyone to hide there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The thing that happened this year was probably the most unexpected and undeniable one. Not only the government but also the US Department of Agriculture confirmed that evidences of alien race were found in the Tonto National Forest. Thinking of this thing as a matter of freedom of information, the department further told that severed human heads were found and the creatures were attacking humans deep in the forest. The local community living there, confirmed the statement given.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Lake Baikal:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-457.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Right in the usually frozen wastelands of Siberia, you will find nothing mysterious. Visit there during the summertime and you will see people enjoying with their families, hanging out, picnicking and hiking. But the real mystery lies in the Lake Baikal. You would say that a lake is too small for being a hideout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now for your information, this lake is the deepest lake (5400 ft down) on earth. The length of 500 miles and area of 12,000 square miles is what makes it at least eligible for being a secret hideout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still people might object that why would alien choose this place over any other place. The answer to this question is simple; the empty tundra nearby and the water body that freezes over is a top place for training things. The Soviet and USSR forces have had some freaky encounters near the lake. Even a high ranked official recorded a vehicle travelling underwater with a speed of 400 miles per hour.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;5. The coast of Malibu:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-458.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The Malibu is situated near the ever famous Los Angeles. Located 30 miles left from the LA, this land is famous for the night parties, hot tubs and even the aliens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were certain circular structure captured by Google Earth which were 6 miles away from the coast and 2,000 feet down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even the sonar images confirm the existence of some coliseum-like structure embedded under the depths of California which was 3 miles in diameter. The scientists are yet to investigate the matter deeply, but they are hesitating may be because of the conclusion that they would face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Dulce, New Mexico:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-459.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;For those of you who already have interest in ufology, this place would be familiar. But for many of you, this news might blow your mind. This town situated in New Mexico is considered as the strongest candidate for being a secret alien hideout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Spanish, Dulce means “sweet”, but the town is as deserted as another place in Mexico. The town has a population if s bit less that 3,000 Native Americans. Everything is fine above the surface, but may be there is something going on under the ground.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is suspected that there might a military bases underground, owned not by the government but the aliens. The government denies this fact over and over again. Paul Bennewitz, a researcher in 1980, even tracked some mysterious underground signals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1995, a US geologist told his own story. When he was supervising an expansion of an already existing base in Dulce, the team found a habitat of seven footed aliens. The battle went on for some time and was a bloody one, that the geologist barely survived at the end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Pine Gap:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-460.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;With growing alien research, every country alongside USA has military cover-ups and black-ops alien technology. Most of the world thinks that only USA has them. But the fact is that many countries have made them for research. Talking about the rest of world, Australia has its own base in the center of the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The base is known as “Pine Gap”, and is not so well-known. But there are things that the government doesn’t want you to know. This base is used to keep track of any satellite passing the earth. The sky there is always clear, making it the best possible place to carry such operations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hidden thing is that the base is being operated by CIA, NSA and NRO and has some confidential information in relation to tracking. Plasma technology and even the brainwashing machinery is kept there. UK’s ministry of defense questioned this place, the answered to which is still pending subject to national security.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Porton Down, England:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-461.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;This small town of Porton Down is situated in the Southwest of England near Salisbury. This town is known for the climate that it has. People living there do just two things; they either drink tea or they complain about the excessive rains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It has a military science facility founded and operated by the UK government but apart from all this, Pordon Down has one other thing that made it famous somehow. In 1974, it was a home to England’s own cover-up Area 51 site.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A UFO crash occurred in the north at Llandrillo, Whales. The residents who witnessed the whole scenario told that they saw a streak of bright lights in the sky. The lights were too numerous in number and way more brighter than the meteor shower. Soon afterwards, a huge bang occurs which shook everything, even the houses far apart from the sight where this happened.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;The aliens that survived were taken to the Porton Down base. The government continuously denied what happened. In 2010, the government announced and accepted that the residents did see the lights and the craft too. But they did not mention what they did to the aliens that they took to the base in Porton.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"8 Suspected Alien Hideouts According to Real Scientists","description":"We are continuously searching for the aliens in the space.
