Wait, what? You might think you’ve misread this information, but believe us when we say we are as shocked as you are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2377.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;metro.co.uk&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What happened&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this case, for Celina Dally, this unlikely scene began with a completely ordinary evening of wine tasting and ended with her buying a police officer an apology cake reading ‘Sorry I tried to bite you.’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2378.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tapoos.com&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yup, you read that right. Dally, originating from Lake Charles, Louisiana, got extremely drunk while wine tasting at McNeese State University and completely passed out in a friend’s car when they were dropping her home. Local media chains have reported that her worried friend who was driving her back called paramedics, owing to her condition. However, when Dally woke up a few hours later, she was in jail, having been arrested for not only public intoxication but also assaulting a police officer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2379.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tapoos.com&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The apology&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2380.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;metro.co.uk&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an attempt to apologise to the wronged Officer Guillory, Dally bought him a cookie cake decorated with the words ‘Sorry I tried to bite you’ all in green and white icing. Dally claims that she was unable to stop thinking about how she assaulted an officer of the law, and the college student decided to reach out to him in order to apologize for her behavior.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2381.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Tapoos.com&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dally went on to the Lake Charles Police Department to look for the officer and give him the cake. According to Dally, the police officer was very cordial and kept thanking her for the cake. He understood that this was an isolated incident and Dally was not normally like this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2382.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tapoos.com&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The police officer recognized that I wasn’t actually an aggressive person. He could comprehend that I was actually a good person at heart and at the time of that unfortunate incident, I was just incredibly drunk.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Giving the world an explanation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dally posted photos from the meeting on all of her personal accounts, including Facebook. In a post on Facebook, that was then soon deleted off the face of the internet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2383.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tapoos.com&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dally, a student at the Sowela Technical Community College, wrote: “A majority of you haven’t found out about the incident which led to my arrest on October 7 on account of not only public intoxication but also for assaulting an officer. While I am not proud of what I did, I can’t deny that it happened. My guilty conscience at attempting to hurt an officer of the law was eating at my heart, so I decided to find the Officer Guillory and apologized with a cookie cake!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The overwhelming reaction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The post went instantly viral all over the internet, leading to Dally receiving all sorts of mixed reactions on her actions. In an interview, Dally shared that she had not expected the huge amounts of attention she and the incident got. She feels a little overwhelmed and rightfully so, she is receiving everything from death threats to video call requests at the middle of the night. People keep referencing what Dally did, to police-involved shootings and reckon she got off too easy. In fact, some people went as far as to say that she deserved to be shot!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The hurtful backlash&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dally, who is herself majoring in criminal justice, said that this incident has opened up her eyes to the world of cyberbullying. She realizes how emotionally traumatizing this incident has been even for someone as emotionally stable as her, and want to reach out to other people in an attempt to make them feel less alone. She’s using this unfortunate incident for something good by making it serve as a platform to spread awareness about cyberbullying and its effects.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Dally is due in court this November. The arresting officer has not only been in touch with her but is also very cordial and has agreed to speak in her favor.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Woman Who Assaulted Cop Apologizes with Cake 'Sorry I Tried to Bite You'","description":"You might think you've misread this information, but believe us when we say we are as shocked as you are."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/6/3d18c8ab38057d6d7dd607d054c6ab46_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/6/4288eba5b7f49cd046573cca93d11e36_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"50 Ridiculous Celebrity Facts That Will Shock You"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/6/37f79b1fc9524f488fdbbbc98a1e1be6_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Sick of Stubborn Belly Fat?
