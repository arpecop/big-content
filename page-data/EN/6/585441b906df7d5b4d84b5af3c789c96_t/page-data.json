Not only is this way decades old but also highly inaccurate as there are a lot of other options which they might not blabber out loudly but would be absolutely delighted if dished out to them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was recent survey done by Men’s Health which really revealed some of the glaring realities of the contemporary lovemaking scene. For example out of the 6700 participating men and women about one third of the participants were really active.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This group was getting intimate more than two or three times in a week however a massive 71% of women reported to be having a fulfilling and satisfying experience while only 50 to 51% men who were also getting busy about the same time reported satisfying experience. This shows that it is not all that simple and straight forward to assume certain stereotypes and just conclude that men are enjoying their time between the sheets since they easily achieve orgasm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To explain this drop in percentage of male sexual satisfaction as compared to women there are a number of factors which need to be taken into account. Daniel Lebowitz who is co-director and male sexuality expert from The Intimacy Institute, Colorado sheds some light on this growing divide of male female sexual fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to him the changing ideals have turned the tables and what women used to feel concerned about prior to getting intimate is now what get the nerves of men. It could easily be explained by increasingly popular media which is making male objectification a reality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Setting unrealistic standards which for an average guy are difficult to achieve making them feel miserable about their own body. For example having a chiseled physique and six pack abs is considered an essential to be appealing thanks to the popular celebrities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Daniel Lebowitz argued that women may also have to feel the brunt of this excessive objectification and coming up to certain standards but for them it has been there for a long time. Women have more or less adapted to this and feel more confident bringing it up. But for men it is kind of just getting the steam and something they are not prepared for at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Redefined roles in relationships may also lead to this decline in men finding pleasure in sex. However the following things are what men may not talk about openly but would absolutely love if their women did it for them.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;1. Initiating the first move&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1604.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Men love if they feel desired and wanted although it is assumed that men ill lead the charge in the bedroom. However once in a while they will absolutely love if their women made the first move and started the love-making. It could be as simple as kissing them or slowly caressing them in anyway. Just making them feel loved and desired will delight them beyond measure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This will also make them less apprehensive about starting the act all the time and thinking they might be appearing desperate. So next time you guys are about to sleep or doing random stuff surprise him in a subtle manner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Dressing up for him only&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1605.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They might feel the contradiction in the way you dress up and beautify yourself for a girl’s night out and how you opt for zero effort when you are alone with him making no special arrangements. This will make them feel unworthy of your attention and worse make them self-doubt their attractiveness to you. If you are taking some time in prepping and primping yourself exclusively for your man will make him feel that much attractive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He will in turn make an effort to please you as his girl as you have already put him in that positive frame of mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Try to be more explicit with him and communicate openly&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1606.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;The problem is the longer you are in a relationship with your guy the less and less you both will talk about your changing needs and desires lest you hurt his feelings. You could in this case positively mention what different things you enjoy more than others and make it clear to him to do those more. This will also make him more confident and means more fulfilling sex for you in return.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"3 Things Your Guy Wants You To Do In Bed…But Will Never Ask For","description":"Men are often stereotyped as getting the maximum satisfaction out of vaginal penetration and that works for them just fine."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/6/585441b906df7d5b4d84b5af3c789c96_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/6/5e39a1332653657a9d8f879927fc1d06_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"What Your Love Life Will Look like in 2018 Based on Your Zodiac"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/6/52e9d1ba20811a56ac0fb064ec78fdd6_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Mom Shares Terrifying Warning, After Routine Car Repair Leaves Her in Agonizing Pain"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
