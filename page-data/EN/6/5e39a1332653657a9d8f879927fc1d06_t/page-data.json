When it comes to love, what better idea there is than to look to the ‘stars’ to guide us and reveal the mysteries they hold. It is never too early to start preparing for receiving love, love, love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-28.gif&quot;/&gt;via tumblr &lt;p&gt;“2018 promises to be an intense and transformative year for many of us,” says Linda Furiate, an Astrologer who specializes in relationships. “Individually and collectively we may be offered moments to dig deep within self, heal our emotional wounds, build affluence and prosperity, and surrender to the mysteries of our being that may yield a year full or hope, promise and joy. Control and manipulation may rear its head only to be severed at the jugular.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, let us take a peek at what the future holds for us, love wise, and see if it indeed is in the stars. Here is your 2018 love life zodiac:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12.Aries (March 21st to April 19th)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1198.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Dear Aries, hold on to your horses because something is happening with Mercury and Venus and you are getting directly affected. Don’t worry; they are all good and wonderful things. Astrologer Valerie Mesa says, “With Jupiter and Mars in your house of intimacy, your sex drive will be poppin’.” But she also warns Aries to be way of who they decide to get frisky with. 2017 was the year when you tried to go with the flow and dapple with casual dating and flinging. However, in 2018 “Aries may experience a nice shift in their love life if they are willing to put in the work,” says Furiate. The next year is when they will make emotional adjustments and learn to co-exist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11.Taurus (April 20th to May 21st)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1199.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;For Taurus, it is Jupiter which is spinning threads of liquid gold the next year. “Taurus could easily see committed love or marriage in 2018,” Furiate says and also suggests to put their guard down and learn to say ‘yes’ to things instead of over-thinking and over-analyzing. It is the right and ripe time to get out and meet new people (or dial things up a notch with the relationships they are in right now). 2018 is predicted to be a big year of romance for Taurus with, may be, marriage on the table. But if that doesn’t happen right away, the year will still be sprinkled with lovey-dovey and super intimate vibes all year long.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[Related: The Gods Blessed Each Zodiac Sign With a Unique Divine Gift]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10.Gemini (May 22nd to June 21st)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1200.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;“With serious Saturn and intense Pluto in your area of intimacy, it’s time you reevaluate your emotional connections,” advises Mesa. Gemini have a lot of raw energy and passion for hard work. This is a good thing relationship wise because they will be willing to put in the hard which just might be the key to making the relationship stick. 2018 is all about work and little play for Gemini and it up to them to shift the focus towards a soulful connection. Luckily, they have exactly the mind-set to be able to pull that off successfully. They might experience some stress work-wise in the coming year but better find an outlet for it so as to not let it meddle with their love life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9.Cancer (June 22nd to July 22nd)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1201.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;2018 is when this lonely crab goes out, finds and falls in love. Romantically in 2017 you had pretty much of a tornado-meeting-a-volcano kind of a vibe going on but things turn around for good (and may be forever?) the coming year. “Your love sector will be overflowing with Jupiter’s optimism and goodness, making you extra affectionate,” croons Mesa. A committed relationship and security are just around the corner for you this year. Light a dumpster fire and let the past and your exes go up in ashes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8.Leo (July 23rd to August 22nd)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1202.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The coming year for Leo is all about shifting the focus on them. Think of it as ‘I gotta do me, first’ kind of undertone for the next year. While you are not letting go of romance and intimacy entirely, you’ll put yourself and your needs first before allowing anyone else to steal the focus from you. Mesa says, “With dreamy Neptune in your area of intimacy, you are focusing more on emotional bonds,” and while you cannot expect to walk down the aisle this year, not yet, but keep your eyes peeled for someone who has always been on the sidelines. They might be the answer.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;7.Virgo (August 23rd to September 22nd)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1203.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;“Virgo may find themselves traveling more in 2018,” Furiate says and while they are on-the-go they might just come across someone from an foreign culture or an exotic land who turns to be the one. Love will definitely play a huge role for you in 2018. You will put your guard down after a long time and finally learn to bask in the warmth of that gorgeous feeling they call love. 2018 is when you make real, life-long connections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[Related: Zodiac Pairs Which Are the Most Passionate and Powerful Together]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6.Libra (September 23rd to October 22nd)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1204.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Libra has had it tough over the past few years. With previous influences from Uranus in 2017, Libra have somewhat re-invented themselves romantically. However, 2018 is going to be the year when the nail hits home, or as the expression goes. “Libra may feel a strong desire [to] replant their roots this year,” Furiate says. Whether they decide to move or take step back and enjoy some down time, this opportunity might end up in them crossing paths with a potential significant other. For those who are already in a relationship put your feet up because the hard part is over. Things will only get better from this point on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5.Scorpio (October 23rd to November 22nd)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1205.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;“Revolutionary Uranus starts moving into your area of partnerships this year, bringing change and a little bit of chaos,” says Mesa. She explains how Uranus is the rebel planet and might bring forth some serious, life-altering changes which will stick their course. This is the year when you not just grow as a person but also get a sexy, sultry make over to your personality. As if a Scorpio needed any more mystery and sex appeal, 2018 is when they truly hit the ball out of the park. Bravo!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4.Sagittarius (November 23rd to December 21st)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1206.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Think soul-searching in a far off stretch of the world where only you and, ironically, the stars reside along with a few like-minded people. Think a 4-star resort where you can crash in after a day’s adventures, exploring new places and meeting new people. One of those new people may stick around, for good. We all know the penchant you have for traveling and adventures and 2018 will be no different. You will take care of yourself like you have never before and if someone right comes along, well and good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[Related: The Creepiest Thing About You Based on Your Zodiac Sign]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3.Capricorn (December 22nd to January 20th)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1207.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;“January’s lunar eclipse in your house of sex will push you to work on your issues with intimacy and emotional connection,” says Mesa. 2018 is all about focusing on romance and friendships, two things Capricorns hold the dearest. If you are already in a relationship, you will feel things becoming serious and instead of second-doubting, as is your nature, we suggest you give love a chance. Making new friends as well as visiting old friendships will be another theme for next year. If you are single, there is a potential friendship-turns-into-love kind of rom-com thing happening for you in the future. Watch out!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2.Aquarius (January 21st to February 18th)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1208.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;2018 is bringing huge changes for you Aquarius and you better let them happen. You tend to let your work overshadow your love life and that needs to change asap. Mesa predicts that, “January’s lunar eclipse in your area of partnerships could be the end of a chapter for you.” Which means that you have some time on your hands to evaluate where you are, love-wise, right now? While it is unlikely that you will meet your soul-mate in 2018, you will definitely cross paths with someone who alters your views on just about everything. They may not stay in your life forever but before they leave, you will be a much better version of yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Pisces (February 19th to March 20th)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1209.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;You have a loving heart and soul. You are like a fountain of love, splashing as much of it around you as you can to benefit as many as possible. It is a very personal and subjective experience for you. The giggles of a child, a fall morning or even sitting quietly by yourself and only thinking are experiences of love for you. “There may be no need to seek love outside of themselves because love permeates their being from within,” says Furiate, “Lucky [for] the partner who does hook up with this Pisces, the height of this love union may expand beyond the heavens.” This deep passion will finally pay off in 2018 when Pisces cross paths with someone they can experience a loving, intimate, soul-enriching relationship with. P.S: this one may be a keeper, just saying.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;[Related: The Dating Mistakes You Keep Making Based on Your Zodiac]&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"What Your Love Life Will Look like in 2018 Based on Your Zodiac","description":"The ‘stars’ tell it all."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/6/5e39a1332653657a9d8f879927fc1d06_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/6/6a87188d0d1a3db7d7cd035c225ef4f6_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"8 Signs You Aren’t Ready to Move for Love"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/6/585441b906df7d5b4d84b5af3c789c96_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"3 Things Your Guy Wants You To Do In Bed…But Will Never Ask For"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
