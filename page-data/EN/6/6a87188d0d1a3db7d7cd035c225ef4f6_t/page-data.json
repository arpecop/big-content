While taking a leap of faith might work out wonderfully, it also has the potential of blowing up in your face. This is exactly why serious thought and consideration need to be put into making a decision as life altering as moving to another city, or things might go awry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A vast majority of the people who move to a different city for their significant other often end up regretting it. Many of the couples involved don’t survive the move and end up breaking up or just resenting their significant other. Moreover, many people expressed dismay over the fact that moving did not improve the state of their relationship, in fact, it just made things harder for all the people involved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moving is a major decision, which means that before making any major decisions, you should try to pinpoint the core reason as to why the move is being deemed so necessary. Relocating to a completely new city is a monumental decision with severe implications on both your professional and personal lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When moving to be with a significant other, the primary motivation is undoubtedly, going to be love. However, it is important to make this decision based on logic and reasoning than just desperation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are thinking of making a move but don’t know which way to sway, do your research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are 8 major signs that relocating for your partner might not be the smartest thing for you to do right now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. You believe that moving is the answer to all your relationship problems&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-20.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Moving to a different city for your significant other, in no way guarantees that you will stop having problems or that your relationship will be all smooth sailing from this point on. While moving away from the place you call home is undoubtedly a huge sacrifice, you need to know that you did it for yourself instead of framing yourself out to be a victim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That will only add to your problems. However, that being said, if you are moving to be with someone who has a history of being volatile and unpredictable, it is foolish to expect moving to be with them to be the answer to all your problems. While you are no victim, moving away is a sacrifice that deserves to be not only appreciated but also acknowledged. Many couples believe that bridging physical distance is the way to solve problems. While being in close physical proximity definitely helps a relationship, if your partner was being distant and selfish when you were apart, don’t expect them to change drastically just because you’re there. However, the close physical presence does mean that you can deal with problems more effectively as compared to when there were miles between you two.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Your partner didn’t ask you to move&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-21.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;It might seem stupid, but having your partner ask you to move is a big deal. Your partner’s support for the move is monumental to the survival of your relationship. If your partner has not encouraged you to move, something is off. They might not be as invested in the relationship as you would like them to be, or maybe they don’t see you two as a long-term option. Either way, if the desire to be physically together is one-sided, it might be a better decision to stay put.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. You and your significant other aren’t exactly on the same page about the future of your relationship&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-22.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Before even thinking of making a decision as big as a move, be prepared to re-evaluate your relationship. You need to see if you and your partner are equally invested in the relationship. Not only that, but you should also go ahead and discuss long-term goals both inside and outside the scope of your relationship to make sure that both your visions are compatible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you move for a partner, you subconsciously start expecting bigger and better things from the relationship. However, that might not really be close to the reality. If you are moving in the hopes of getting engaged or married, not only are you moving for the wrong reasons but your relationship will undoubtedly suffer when your expectations don’t materialize.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;5. The move will distance you from family&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-23.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Living from a distance from your family does not necessarily have to be a bad thing. Sure everyone wants to be close to their loved ones, but moving away does not mean you will never get to see them. However, the love and warmth that family represents can’t be underestimated. Having family around is important and should be a factor that is taken into account when making a big move.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. You have never thought about moving to a new city before the course of this relationship&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-24.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Relocating for only pleasing a significant other, spells nothing but trouble. If you had no interest in moving or travel before you met your significant other, it might be a cause for alarm and thus, a bad idea for you to move.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When making big decisions, such as a move, it is important to weigh out all possible alternatives. While depressing, the fact that your relationship might not work out, in the long run, is a very true possibility. In the event that that might happen, you might be left to fend yourself in a completely unknown territory. Therefore, make sure you have a plan that does not only revolve around your partner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. You aren’t used to spending large amounts of time together&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-25.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Before making a commitment as big as a move, give yourself a test trial, especially if you are not used to spending large amounts of uninterrupted time together. Plan a two week holiday to see how the both of you react in a situation like that. Living under the same roof for 24/7 is not as easy or dreamy as it sounds. Therefore, instead of coming to regret your decision later, give it a trial run to see if you remain unswayed and ready to move to another city for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. You’re not 100% yourself around your partner&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-26.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;While living together with your partner can be amazing, moving to another city might not be a fun ride if you are still in the initial stages of your relationship. To make sure you are ready for this, evaluate if you are in the comfortable stage of your relationship yet. Are you okay with walking around wearing your acne ointment as they laze around in crusty pajamas, not remembering when they showered last? If you still feel like these are private things, making a move might not be the best way to go.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. You keep feeling like you’re giving up a lot&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-27.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;If you are making the move but can’t stop the nagging feeling that you are giving up too much, such as a hard-earned job, important family connections or you just feel generally inconvenienced, you might not be making the move wholeheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Only you know how you feel inside, and your feelings, warranted or not, matter. If your heart is telling you that something is not right, then you should take some time out to reevaluate the reasons behind your move and the consequences it might bring forth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"8 Signs You Aren’t Ready to Move for Love","description":"Relocating to a completely new city is a monumental decision with severe implications on both your professional and personal lives."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/6/6a87188d0d1a3db7d7cd035c225ef4f6_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/6/78c3139b0b4ef64348b6c65911477e66_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Top 9 Mysterious Things Found Frozen in Ice"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/6/5e39a1332653657a9d8f879927fc1d06_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"What Your Love Life Will Look like in 2018 Based on Your Zodiac"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
