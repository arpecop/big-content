Here are 21 everyday things that you didn’t think had a purpose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;21. The hole at the top of a ball point pen cap&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-938.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;If you didn’t know, there is a hole there. For those who do notice the little things might not think of this as something worthy enough to think over in the first place. So there’s a hole in a pen cap? Who cares, right? Well, the hole is designed so as to minimize the risk of suffocation. Imagine if you were a kid and you had a fascination with small things, especially pen caps. The first thing kids do when they see something new and different is to try and put it in their mouths. If a ball point pen cap was to get lodged in a kid’s throat, the hole at the top would keep the airway open until help can be reached.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;20. Small patch of fabric that comes in with new clothes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-939.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Most new clothes come with a small plastic packet containing buttons (easy enough to see why) and often a small patch of cloth that your clothing item is made of. This is not for patches but for the customers to test out for washing and if their detergent would cause the fabric to fade or not. Genius!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;19. What about that hole in the middle of the pasta spoon?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-940.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The main purpose of the hole in the center and fanged bits on the spoon is to help you scoop pasta out of boiling water and strain it. Another lesser known purpose is that the hole in the center is for measuring out spaghetti according to a single portion. No more cooking for the entire block, accidentally, every week!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;18. The next time you are driving, take a look at the gas gauge on the speedometer, will you?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-941.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Many people might not even have noticed that there is an arrow next to the gas gauge. But it is there for one important reason: to make your life simpler. The side the arrow is on indicates the side the gas cap is on. This information comes in a lot handy if you are frequent traveler and tend to rent cars a lot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;17. Thick bits on your computer cords&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-942.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;We have all seen them but most of us don’t know what these are for. These contain bits of magnetic iron oxide and are called ferrite cores. Ever noticed how your speakers get a disruption when you take your phone too close to them? These ferrite cores are made to prevent exactly that happening to your computer screens and power supplies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;16. Using cutters the right way&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-943.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;My entire life I’ve been using paper cutters the wrong way. Ever notice the little lines that you see on the cutter blade? Yes, I am aware that you know that we are supposed to cut off the blade at those lines to get rid of the one we have been using once it gets blunt. But did you know how you’re supposed to cut? No, it doesn’t involve sliding it up and then applying pressure against a surface until it snaps off (NEVER do that!).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take off the cap at the back and slide out the blade backwards. Use the cap to cut the blade and then assemble it back together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. Hole under a padlock&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-944.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The tiny hole under a padlock serves two purposes. You can oil the lock through this hole to keep it working properly and it also acts as a filter if the lock is going to be used underwater. It is also believed that this hole prevents the padlock from rusting for as long as possible when used outdoors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. Bumps on the F and J keys on your keyboard&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-945.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Expert typists would know that in the 10-finger typing method, these two keys are the ‘home’ keys. So the bumps on F and J help you navigate your way back home and the rest of the keys on your keyboard accordingly without removing your eyes from the screen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Wings on Apple power cables&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yep we&#39;ve all been doing it wrong this whole time 😆 #Apple #magsafe #lifehacks pic.twitter.com/lNx3OGg0Co&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Jeremiah Smith (@itsJeremiahS) September 13, 2016&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A lot of people have been doing this wrong their entire lives. The wings flip up and give you something to wrap the cable around. Fold the thicker part of the cable around the power block and then use the wings to fold the thinner cables around. And then use the little clamp at the end to secure it properly. Everything serves a purpose!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Hole on the side of Converse trainers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-946.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;These holes provide better ventilation to athletes, as they were originally meant as basketball shoes. They also provide an alternate way of tying laces which is meant to give better ankle support.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. The little plastic disc under bottle caps&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-947.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via alibaba &lt;p&gt;These little plastic discs ensure that they keep the drink carbonated for as long as possible. Without these your sodas would go flat in no time. This is why you see them underneath carbonated drink caps and not in water bottles.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;10. Indentations under wine and champagne bottles&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Rechtzeitig zu den Feiertagen haben wir unseren Kostbar Sekt degorgiert – und natürlich probiert. Unser Team empfiehlt ihn als wunderbaren Genuss für die Vorweihnachtszeit, Weihnachtsfeiern, die Festtage und Silvester #christmas #christmas2015 #wein #weingut #weinlese #Weinflasche #rotwein #weisswein #sekt #faubel #weinkeller #maikammer #pfalz #neustadt #instagood #photooftheday #beautiful #happy #picoftheday #instadaily #yummy #travel #foodporn&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Weingut Faubel Pfalz (@weingutfaubel) on Dec 2, 2015 at 10:54am PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wine and champagne go through a lot of pressure during the corking process. As the bottom and sides of a bottle are its weakest points, these indentations are made in bottles to help distribute the pressure evenly. It is especially helpful for corking champagne because of the extra pressure carbonation adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Holes in airplane windows&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-948.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered what the hole on an airplane window is for? Called bleed holes, they are there for our safety. As pressure changed in the cabin during takeoff, landing as well as during the flight it is important to keep the pressure equalized between the two adjacent window panes as well. It also ensures that the most pressure is on the outer pane and in case something was to go wrong with pressure, that pane would blow off first instead of the inner one keeping you relatively safer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Hat bobbles are there for a purpose&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-949.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The bobbles on winter hats are not just fashion, they used to serve a bigger purpose for marine sailors. French sailors would wear hats with bobbles on top to help soften the blow to their head should they bump it on the low cabin ceiling. Since vessels in the sea move up and down according to the waves, they were easily in the danger of hurting their heads if there was a sudden jerk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. The hole in the Chupa Chups lollipop&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-950.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Often believed that it is there to prevent a choking hazard from happening should a kid swallow the stick, the hole is actually meant for something else. During production while the candy is still liquid, the stick is inserted into it and the candy hardens around it. Some of the liquid candy makes its way inside the hole and acts as a seal. This way there is a lesser chance of the entire candy breaking off and choking a kid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. The signature line is not a line at all&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-951.jpeg&quot;/&gt;list25 &lt;p&gt;The signature line on bank checks isn’t actually a plain line. It is ‘authorized signature’ written in tiny print over and over again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. “I’ll have a glass of buttermilk”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-952.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;No you won’t. You will have a glass of the milk which is leftover from churning butter. There is no milk with butter in it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Loop on backs of shirts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-953.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Some button-up shirts still come with a loop at their backs which was first introduced in the 1960s. Simple enough to figure out, it was so that the shirts could be hung on pegs to avoid creasing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Hole at the end of a tape measure&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-954.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;If you have ever used a tape measure you will know how bad it hurts if it coils back accidentally and snips your hand in the process. To avoid that from happening, there is a small rectangular hole at the end of a tape measure so that you can hook it into nails and screws and avoid a very painful injury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Soda tab on cans&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-955.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Pop a soda open, swing around the tab, slide your straw through it and you will never have to worry about the straw bobbing around again. The hole in the tab keeps the straw in place and you can easily take swings without worrying about the straw falling out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. 57 on Heinz ketchup bottles&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Our new Hawaii #HeinzBBQ sauce captures best of island BBQ—an enchanting flavor that is subtly sweet and balanced by a hint of smoke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Heinz Ketchup (@heinzketchup_us) on May 23, 2017 at 9:11am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;You might have noticed the number 57 on various Heinz ketchup bottles and sauces. It isn’t decorative and doesn’t hold any momentous value for the company, as one might think. It is there to help you get the sauce out evenly. So instead of shaking the bottle, bumping it on the bottom or outright going bonkers with it, simply press the bottle on its sweet spot where it says 57 and it will come out easily. According to the company only 11% of the people know this and hopefully you just raised that percentage.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"21 Things You Didn't Know About Common Objects","description":"Everything serves a purpose."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/6/1a38411f183716f2b362db7e89fbb6f6_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/6/22cc17fb557f3a8add0797817dfa4166_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"It Started When She Was 12, 16-Year-Old Was Raped 43,200 Times"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/6/15d2fac89dec09909545fc19aa420596_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"What Children Around the World Eat for Lunch at School"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
