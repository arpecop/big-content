Promises of a happily ever ending turned into her biggest nightmare. Karla Jacinto was tricked into becoming a victim of sex trafficking by a pimp who tricked her into falling in love with him.

Unfortunately, this story is nothing like that. What you’re about to read is sure to bring tears to your eyes. Some of us aren’t so lucky in life, this is the story of Karla Jacinto, so sit back, relax, because what I’m about to tell you isn’t for the faint-hearted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A little girl’s dream gone wrong&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-592.jpeg&quot;/&gt;likemag.com &lt;p&gt;We all look for love at some point in our lives, some much earlier than others. Karla Jacinto was just 12-years-old when she was searching for the love of her life. Now, you might already be shaking your head in disapproval, but when you come from a poor family, and poverty is the only thing you’ve known all your life, you look for ways to get out of your horrid reality. Young Karla had the same idea, she hoped for a better future with a much older man who promised to treat her like the princess she is, and to stay by her side through thick and thin. So, she decided that the only way to get away from this life of poverty is to marry her hero and start a new life. She would later begin to regret this decision that changed her life for the worse!&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;Survival in a jungle of broken dreams&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-594.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;She never imagined that the man who promised her the world would end up being a pimp. He targeted and preyed on young girls like Karla. If it wasn’t bad enough that the love of her life turned to be a fraud but now she was ordered to sell herself on the streets for him, just to survive. She had no choice but to obey if she wanted to live. He would beat her numb, spit in her face, and even burn her if she didn’t do as she was told. The pimp took her to his hometown Tenancingo, Mexico. This is where Karla was sold and forced to live out her days selling her body just to get by. By this time Karla had gone into a catatonic shock, she felt like a living corpse, neither dead nor alive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-596.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The 12-year-old had to work from 10 am in the morning till midnight every single day. She satisfied the disgusting hunger of men for 4 years. Thirty customers a day, sometimes even more, was her life now. It’s not that the poor little girl has never tried to run away before, or the idea never crossed her mine. These pimps have a way of instilling fear into their victims, beating them, and threatening to harm them or their loved one. They stay put because of this fear, and that is exactly what happened to Karla. Her clients were police officials, well-known politicians, and priests. Her pimp ruined her dreams of ever running away, and made sure she got the idea that this is her life now, so she better get used to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A happy ending&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-598.jpeg&quot;/&gt;i.dailymail.co.uk &lt;p&gt;Karla’s nightmare came to an end when she was 16-years-old. A volunteer organization liberated the broken little girl and helped her to get her life back on track. Freed at last, Karla calculated the number of times she was forcefully raped by men, the number sent chills up our spines. It’s hard to believe that at such a young age, this little girl was raped 43,200 times by her customers. But, she wasn’t going to let that ruin the rest of her life. Today, Karla is working with her rescuers to free young women and girls from these sex traffickers ring. Her battle to help these women become free from the chains of these powerful systems surely puts her life at risk, but it’s a risk worth taking.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;“When I wake up in the morning, I don’t know if I will live until the evening. Death lurks around the next corner because I do what I do.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"It Started When She Was 12, 16-Year-Old Was Raped 43,200 Times","description":"Lied to and forced, you won’t believe what this little girl had to endure!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/6/22cc17fb557f3a8add0797817dfa4166_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/6/237cc5e69b9993ae300b2ee64321dad6_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Warning Signs That Your Boyfriend Is Toxic"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/6/1a38411f183716f2b362db7e89fbb6f6_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"21 Things You Didn't Know About Common Objects"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
