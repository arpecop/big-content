These are meant to absorb Aunty Flo when sheâ€™s paying a visit and can potentially eliminate the need for other products like pads, tampons and diva cups. So what exactly are period panties and how do they even work? Youâ€™re curious. We are curious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Genius at work&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-10.gif&quot;/&gt;cc via giphy &lt;p&gt;The science behind period panties almost borders on pure genius. These are made up of a special layered combination of micro-fibers which are designed to &lt;em&gt;pull &lt;/em&gt;liquid away from the body to trap it inside the panty and prevent it from leaking. Some of these layers are made up of fibers specially designed to wick away moisture from the body and other layers, made of micro-fibers, help trap this moisture into a giant maze of super, small and tiny filaments. All of these layers combine to give as much as protection as possible and can ideally soak up blood from 1 teaspoon to 5 teaspoons at a time. Revolutionary, indeed!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Itâ€™s not how you think it is&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-11.gif&quot;/&gt;via tumblr &lt;p&gt;You might think that something that is supposed to absorb all your period blood will be thick and bulky and make you feel like Donald Duck. Nope, it wonâ€™t. Period panties are &lt;em&gt;made &lt;/em&gt;to make those days of discomfort extra comfortable for you. These are just like any other panties and once you slip them on, you wonâ€™t even know the difference. Pinky promise!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Different types of period panties for different type of flow&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-12.gif&quot;/&gt;tumblr via giphy &lt;p&gt;Just like every woman is different, in the same way their period is also different. Some women bleed more than others. Some women tend to have a heavier flow in the first two or three days as compared to the rest of the days. We get it. The panty makers get it. That is why there are different shapes and sizes of panties available with each style catering for different absorption level. Thinx is one of the most popular period panty name on the market right now and they have introduced different panties depending on how much they can absorb, for example, The Hiphugger (holds up to two tampons worth of blood), the Sport (up to 1 1/2 tampons) and the Boy short (up to 1 tampon).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Comfy and sexy!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-13.gif&quot;/&gt;via tumblr &lt;p&gt;There is a very slim chance that when you come across period panties while shopping youâ€™ll say, &lt;em&gt;that totally looks like period underwear&lt;/em&gt;. Since we usually reserve our most worn out, frumpy and dull panties (ruined from all those times blood leaks into them) as period panties, we do not expect these to look cute at all. But they are! According to many women now addicted to using period panties, they find them so comfortable and sexy that they also opt for wearing these when they are not on their period. They have a super refined cut (whichever style should you choose) and the fabric is not restrictive at all. These are like a cross between soft, fancy underwear and swimsuit bottoms. These also come with lace trimmings to make you look and feel good even when you might be bleeding your insides out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Oh, and did we tell you they &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;double as swimsuit bottoms?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-14.gif&quot;/&gt;via tumblr &lt;p&gt;Let me tell you of a time when my friends planned an impromptu trip to Hawaii. Going to Hawaii means only one thing- lots and lots of time in the sea! They had all sorts of things planned and I decided to test my period panties and their â€˜super absorbentâ€™ claims as well. Even though they are not advertised as swimsuit bottoms I was still extremely comfortable using them that way. There was absolutely no spillage while I was in the water and no one could even tell I was wearing period panties! They do not sag when drenched because they dry very easily and are meant to be absorbent. Best vacation while on periods ever!&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;7. Comfortable nights&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-15.gif&quot;/&gt;via tumblr &lt;p&gt;If I had dollar for every time I have had a nightmare about leaking through my pad and ruining the sheets while on my period, Iâ€™d have a house in Malibu with its own private beach. Or if I had a dollar for every time I have &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;leaked through my pad and soaked my sheetsâ€¦ well you get the picture. Itâ€™s like even when I would be asleep; my mind would be awake worrying about bleeding through my pad. In the morning, the first thing Iâ€™d do would rush to the toilet to change the damn pad before it filled up. With period panties, these petty worries are ancient history. No more do you have to worry about your pad moving in your sleep or having to wake up at night to change your tampon. You can wake up in the morning, fresh after an undisturbed nightâ€™s sleep looking like the poster picture of a happy, satisfied woman. Game changer, life saver panties!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. There is no need to change it all that often&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-16.gif&quot;/&gt;via tumblr &lt;p&gt;Typically, I would go to the toilet every 2 or 3 hours to change my pad or tampon, especially on the heavy days. Period panties reduce toilet trips (unless it is for number 1 or 2) by almost half. As they are meant to wick away leakage and provide absorption, you donâ€™t feel wet in your panties at all. They also hold up to around 2 teaspoons of period blood easily so you donâ€™t have to go to the toilet unless you really have to &lt;em&gt;go&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your bathroom trips will be quicker while wearing period panties. There is no need to balance your bag on your lap and trying your best to keep your pants off the floor all the while fishing desperately for that tampon or pad you &lt;em&gt;swear &lt;/em&gt;you put in your bag just before you left the house. But itâ€™s not there now, you swear under your breath (not really, you could be heard all the way to the menâ€™s bathroom) and you are very, very screwed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Toxic shock, what?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-17.gif&quot;/&gt;via tumblr &lt;p&gt;My mom scared the crap out of me with her lecture on leaving my tampon in for too long and dying of a toxic shock. So I thought she was just exaggerating and scaring me into doing something so I decided to ask the Internet for help. The internet scared the remaining crap out of me. Although it is pretty rare, we have all heard of it and know of at least one friend of a friend of a friend who was rushed to the ER because she left her tampon in too long, got a bacterial infection and almost died of toxic shock. Fortunately, period panties take care of this worry, among others, as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Environmentally friendly&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-18.gif&quot;/&gt;via tumblr &lt;p&gt;Something that you can reuse is better for our environment instead of something that you would use only once and then chuck out. Just think of how much sanitary pads and tampons you would use and throw away in your lifetime and then multiply it with half the worldâ€™s population. Thatâ€™s a lot of waste! Collectively, American women throw away at least 700 million pounds of menstrual hygiene products every year! Period panties are definitely an environmentally friendly option. Mother earth thanks you!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. You will actually be saving money&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-19.gif&quot;/&gt;via tumblr &lt;p&gt;Starting from as low as $24 (check out these Thong panties), period panty brands like Thinx offer a discount on the purchase of more than one item. That means you can purchase an entire weekâ€™s worth of period panties in a go and then you are set for a long time. These do not run when washed and the fabric holds absolutely fine so there is literally no wear and tear. The initial cost may sound a lot but you could add one panty a month till you have enough for an entire periodâ€™s duration. Think of this as a long-term investment. There will be virtually no need to buy tampons or pads every single month as long as you have your trusted period panties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Easy to wash&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-20.gif&quot;/&gt;via tumblr &lt;p&gt;Very frankly, the only reservation I ever had about using period panties was washing them. You have to first rinse them in the sink and then wash them in the machine like regular clothing. The sight of blood (and period blood at that!) in your sink can be a bitâ€¦ unnerving. Okay, Iâ€™ll be honest! That is something obviously very yucky and gag inducing. Those who already use a moon cup or re-usable pads wonâ€™t feel much of a difference but for a new consumer of period panties, this is something that will take some getting used to. However, when you think about how much youâ€™d be saving cost-wise each month, the impact it will have on the environment in the long run and how much more comfortable theyâ€™ll make you feel on a day to day basis then period panties will definitely come out as the winner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. No more dry vag and rashes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-21.gif&quot;/&gt;via tumblr     &lt;p&gt;One of the things I absolutely hate about tampons is inserting them when my vagina is almost as dry as the Sahara, but still bleeding. What sort of absurd logic is that, really? Wearing cotton panties with pads also gives me rashes towards the end of my period. It just a wonderful party from hell down there during those days with anti-rash cream smeared all around my inner thighs, the pad sticking out on the sides and me waddling like a duck when no one is around. But sound the horns because period panties are here and I am saying good bye to itchy lady bits and a sore and dry vagina forever. Girl, bye!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"12 Reasons You Should Try Period Panties","description":"Panties that will change your life forever.
