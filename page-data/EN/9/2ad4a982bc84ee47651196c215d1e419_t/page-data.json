First are those issues about which can and should do something rather than just mope around as most of us do each and every day of our lives. The second kind is far more heart wrenching when there is absolutely nothing one can do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While people do in general recognize the dangers and the evil of such things as guns or terrorism what many fail to understand however, are the very real dangers of drunk driving.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every 53 minutes one innocent by stander is run over by a driver who is driving under the influence of alcohol. Liam was killed in the incident in September, his parents however as bereaved as they were decided to do something so that countless other parents could spared the pain that they had to go through. Thus rather than simple rage the couple gathered up their courage to try to make a positive impact on society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;An adorable baby&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Liam was born in the city of Santa Monica, California on May, 25 in 2015.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The adorable toddler loved to meet with and interact with new people. He would smile at people, give them high fives, blow kisses. Liam was a wonderful and adorable little baby, his parents loved him dearly and were left devastated when he was run over while in his stroll.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;The three had a picture perfect life until that fateful day. His father Marcus was a fighter quite literally and was a professional Mixed Martial Arts fighter. Even though his father had the physical strength to take on just about anybody who might be naïve or ignorant enough to try to harm his family, nothing could have prepared him for the tragedy which befell the family out of the blue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;One day in September.&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just as life seemed nearly picture perfect on a typical September day Liam’s mother asked her sister to take him out on a short stroll so that she could study and her husband Marcus was fast asleep. That was on the fateful day of September,3rd, 2015.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Liam’s aunt was more than happy to take her cutie pie nephew on a walk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the aunt nephew duo came close to a crosswalk his aunt herself only 15 waited for the lights to turn green so that they could cross. Just as they were about to make their way across in came 72 year Donna Mary Higgins who was drunk clearly not in her right senses. The old lady hit both young Liam and his aunt who herself was only 15 at the time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1211.jpeg&quot;/&gt;thenypost &lt;p&gt;Both aunt and nephew were quickly rushed to hospital. The aunt made a full recovery. Sweet little Liam however was not so fortunate the hospital confirmed that he was brain dead and subsequently he was taken off life support and passed away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though Marcus and Mishel can never get their Liam back they decided to donate his organs so that some other kid may live. “We wanted Liam’s life to live on through someone else and there are not nearly enough organ donors out there” Marcus said.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;“Drunk driving is preventable. By definition it is a crime, it is attempted murder, but yet still the average American has to drive drunk 80 times before getting caught and penalized,” stated an angry Marcus as the couple tries their best to lobby to halve the drunk driving limit from 0.08 to 0.04 at least if not lower still so that other parents do not have to go through what they have.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"15 Month Old Liam Was Killed by a Drunk Driver — Now His Parents Are Fighting for Justice","description":"Marcus Kowal and his wife Mishel Eder lost their 15 month old son, Liam after he was run over by a drunk driver last September.
