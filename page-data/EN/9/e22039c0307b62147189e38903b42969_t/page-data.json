You might often think that there is no reason to smile at all. But this is where you got it wrong. Even small positive things and act of kindness can bring smile on you face, and can work as a pain killer after facing all the burden.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have collected some simple yet uniquely funny pictures that can make you smile and act as a pain reliever. The following is what we are talking about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;16. The fake hurdle:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-998.jpeg&quot;/&gt;reddit &lt;p&gt;Starting with the most innovative and funny picture of all; here is the way to stop your cat from going upstairs. This picture is enough to make you smile because the innocence in the eyes of the cat can be seen. The dinosaurs are really scaring the cat, don’t you think?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. Helping the duck out:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1000.jpeg&quot;/&gt;reddit &lt;p&gt;As we mentioned above, an act of kindness can surely make your day better than what it was seconds ago. What can be kinder than a lady helping mama duck and her babies to cross a three lane road.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. The amazing donut:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-10.png&quot;/&gt;imgur &lt;p&gt;People usually associate donuts with the police officers. Well this photo can definitely amaze you like the dog got amazed by the donut. This donut does not need any advertisement. The picture is enough to make any mouth watery and make any lips smile widely. Deliciously hilarious we mean!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Duck buying the grocery:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1003.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur &lt;p&gt;If you do not feed your duck on time, they can take the situation in their hands (or beak) and go to the grocery store. This picture has two main reasons to make you smile; the first reason is the one that we mentioned already and the second one is the mama duck sitting adorably with her babies. Mother’s love and a shopping duck is a deadly combination when it comes to giving you a reason to smile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. The doggy slumber&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1005.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur &lt;p&gt;Dogs are well-known for loyalty that they have for their owners. Well they are known for one more thing, which is sleeping in the most unusual places. This picture is a clear cut example of what we are saying. Many say that dogs are color blind. Sleeping in such awkward place is surely not due to the colorblindness factor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. The kitten-sitter:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1007.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur &lt;p&gt;Dads working for their daughters and taking care of their kittens is adorable itself. The dad in this picture is doing exactly the same thing. The thing that makes it funnier is the way the cat is looking at the man. It feels as if it is saying that dad please you do not have to give proofs about such small thing, she is your daughter not your girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Elephant meeting the sea lion:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1009.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur &lt;p&gt;We have seen animals interacting with other animals of same habitat. But what if the elephant sees a sea lion swimming? The staff at Oregon Zoo gave this elephant a little trip, and she liked the sea lion the most. The happiness on her face will bring smile on anyone’s face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. The caring daddies:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1011.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur &lt;p&gt;Combing daughter’s hair and polishing her nails is always considered as mommy’s job. The salon in this picture breaks that perception and trains the daddies into a helping hand when it comes to combing or nail polishing. This beautiful idea of nourishing a father-daughter relation is the reason why you are smiling right now.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;8. Paws to smile:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-11.png&quot;/&gt;reddit &lt;p&gt;Many animal lovers keep dogs and cats for the adorable things that they do. Even the expressions on their faces are the cutest thing on planet. But this picture focuses on the thing that I continuously neglect, which is the paws. The paws of a tiny little puppy are no less adorable than the human babies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. The new dog house:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1013.jpeg&quot;/&gt;reddit &lt;p&gt;Dogs have already earned two featured in our list. This third picture proves that dogs are technically the best thing to make anyone smile. A dog resting in a toy rack is unusual as we as funny to some extent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. The trio of cuteness:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-12.png&quot;/&gt;reddit &lt;p&gt;WWE fans are nowadays crazy for “The Shield”, also know as the hounds of justice. Well these 3 hounds of cuteness can definitely earn nearly if not more of the popularity that the hounds of justice achieved. These fluffy little creatures can melt even the hardest of hearts for sure!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. The act of kindness:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1014.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur &lt;p&gt;It is said that no matter how sad you are, even a kind act done by a stranger can help you smile. In this picture you can see people lifting the guy in the wheelchair, giving him much deserved attention and a reason to laugh out loud. Well only he is not the guy smiling, you are smiling as well. *wink* *wink*&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Down the cat:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1015.jpeg&quot;/&gt;reddit &lt;p&gt;We usually find cats as an adorable animal with them doing cute things every now and then. But the question is, does the cats look equally adorable from downwards? The question is splendidly answered in this picture. Those cute little paws and an interrogating look is the reason why you are smiling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. The hamster bed:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1016.jpeg&quot;/&gt;reddit &lt;p&gt;People say that baby animals look adorable while they are sleeping with their moms. Well that might be right but this cute little hamster sleeping in a hamster bed is way cuter than anything else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Are you happy deer?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1017.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur &lt;p&gt;A deer might be happy when it stays away from the carnivorous beasts and hunters but the thing that makes her happier is when you feed her with fresh apples. This picture is quite rare because you do not see a human giving apples to a deer, and the deer joyously accepting the gift in such a smiley fashion. An apple a day can make a deer happy everyday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. The cutest ghost on this planet:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1018.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur     &lt;p&gt;Ghost are considered as the scariest and the most dangerous thing on planet. The Hollywood movies have made us to believe that ghost can be dangerous at any given time. But this picture can surely change your perception. A cute little girl dressed up as a ghost with her dog proving to be the ever famous ‘human friend’. Both of them are looking adorable with that white cloak on them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"16 Photos That Will Bring a Smile to Your Face Even If You're Having a Bad Day","description":"Having a bad day?
