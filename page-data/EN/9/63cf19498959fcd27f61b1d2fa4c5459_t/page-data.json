The production teams may not admit it sometimes but some of them already have to ease our curiosity. Throughout the history of animation, cartoon characters have been inspired by real people and this is how they look so real and relevant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Native American actress Irene Bedard not only did voice-over for 90’s blockbuster cartoon movie Pocahontas but was the inspiration behind the character. Can you imagine the legendary movie ‘Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs’ has also taken its lead character’s inspiration from the 40’s well-known actress Marge Champion? She also modeled for Blue Fairy in Pinocchio.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apart from the above mentioned characters, here are the 15 most popular cartoon characters that are inspired by real people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. Aladdin – Tom Cruise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-298.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Yeah, you read it right. The top-rated handsome hero of Hollywood, Tom Cruise was the inspiration behind the middle-eastern character Aladdin. Tom was doing projects like A Few Good Men (1992) and Far and Away (1992) which earned him the tags of being a brashly self-confident and brave guy with a good wit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though when the script of Aladdin was written, the production did not have a personality like Cruise in mind. But who cares if the character fits its inspiration perfectly?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. Bugs Bunny – Clark Gable&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-299.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Animator Friz Freleng was in dire need of inspiration for his character Bugs Bunny in 1934. This was the time when Clark appeared in a comedy movie ‘It Happened One Night. The reason Bugs Bunny rose to great heights of fame was his style of munching on a carrot. This exactly was the trait of Gable as he munches on a carrot in the movie, talking from one side of his mouth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. The Vultures in Jungle Book – The Beatles &amp;amp; Fab Four&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-300.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;For the voice over of Vulture’s role in Disney’s iconic The Jungle Book, there seems a bit controversy as some relate it to Fab Four and some to The Beatles, the most popular band in the world of its time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rumors has it, The Beatles excused to do the voice of The Vultures initially as it did not match with their schedule. However, the Ziggy, Dizzy, Bussy and Flaps accent kind of prove this rumor false as they resemble with The Beatles a lot more than anyone. Fans who claim the voice to be matching with Chad Stuart and Lord Tim Hudson is because of the voices in the end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12.

The ‘Speed Zone’ Italian-American actress Alyssa Milano is the inspiration behind Ariel. Milano being 17, at that time, had acted in three films including the comedy “Speed Zone”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The inspiration of this character is actually taken from 1839 fable by a Norwegian author Hans Christian Andersen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11.

The resemblance is just unmistakable!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10.
