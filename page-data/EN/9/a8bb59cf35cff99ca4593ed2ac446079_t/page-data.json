The mother later on committed suicide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The boy was only 14 years old and was shot by his mother, Kameron Craig was a high school student and was shot dead in cold blood in the horrific murder-suicide. He passed away in Pender Memorial Hospital in the city of Burgaw.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His mother who was forty three had shot him in the head before committing suicide herself. She died on the spot while the son died two days later in hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1429.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Kameron Craig her 14 year old son and victim, did not live with his mother and instead he used to live with his grandparents and it is there that his mother came to visit him. Jennifer Craig had also updated her status just a few hours before the tragic incident and gave some insights into her mental health. She was not in the best state of mental health and suffered from chronic seasonal depression close to the holiday season. Depression continues to be neglected and is not given due attention. However depression is contributing to the suicide epidemic in which tens of thousands of lives are lost each and every year.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1430.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;‘The most difficult moment of the year for depression is coming. Depression and anxiety are very personal mental disorders.’ The single mother wrote earlier on the fateful day that would be the last day of her life. The middle aged woman wrote ‘everyone says: ‘if you need anything, don’t hesitate, I’ll be there for you.’ It is clear that her depression should have raised alarm bells with her doctors and the authorities however nobody had considered it a serious problem before it was too late.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Craig’s Facebook reads that ‘I can do BAD all by myself, but I can do GREAT with the ones I love.’ The whole incident is as devastating as it is tragic one can only imagine the pain that their loved ones are now going through.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1431.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Dailymail via Facebook &lt;p&gt;Jennifer’s young son, Kameron Craig was a bright and promising young man and was very good at mathematics. It would be safe to assume that had he lived longer he would have become a productive member of society had his life not been cut short by this tragic incident.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This latest tragedy adds to the growing debate on gun laws in the country. People can get hold of lethal fire arms as easily as they can get groceries. There are no meaningful checks and balances on gun owners meaning that deadly firearms often end up in the hands of those who are eager and willing to use them on the public.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mass shooting in Las Vegas earlier was the biggest massacre in the history of United States when one white man with guns was able to gun down dozens of people. Debate continues to grow and voices calling for controlling limiting gun sales continue to grow however all of this is happening to very little effect.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;The Republicans, are so fiercely loyal to the gun lobby that they have and will continue to shoot down any meaningful controls to try to check the rampant spread of guns across the country. The United States has the highest rate of gun ownership in the world among all countries not suffering from civil unrest.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Teen Dies in North Carolina, Days After Being by Her Mom, Who Went on to Commit Suicide.","description":"In a tragic incident in North Carolina, authorities have said that a young boy in his teens has died several days after he was shot by his own mother.
