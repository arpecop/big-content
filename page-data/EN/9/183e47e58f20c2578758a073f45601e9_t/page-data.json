But there are times when they believe in the myths which the heard from their parent or through interaction with other people. Some myths might be right but more often than not these myths are mere misconception. We have collected some myths rather misconceptions that most of you hear everyday. Without any further delay, we will unveil our collection now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. The sight improvement:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-357.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Many of the times, you will here it from your parents that eating blueberries and carrots improves your vision. But of course everyone knows that carrot is a vegetable, not a magic wand. It does contain the necessary vitamins that are essential for your retina. But the thing is that these vitamin can not improve your vision at all. It can not turn you from a “teen with nerdy glasses” into a “sharp shooter”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Mice love cheese:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-358.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Well everyone watched the cartoon “Tom &amp;amp; Jerry” where you see Jerry doing anything go eat cheese. This misconception is what many people believe in nowadays. The truth is that mouse eats anything everything, whether it is plastic, cardboard or even cloths. Mice have no specific preferences when it comes to eating stuff. Now the question is that what is the origin of this myth? The answer to this question is that in past cheese was stored in open places more than other products. This gave them the perfect opportunity to eat cheese and fill their tummies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Dogs are colorblind:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-359.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Many of us think that dogs are colorblind. For those of you who do not know what colorblindness is; well it is the disorder that makes it impossible for the seers to distinguish colors separately and can only draw outlines of objects with the help of different brightness levels. The dog trainers restrained from using colors while training their dogs. With the passage of time, scientists proved that dogs can perceive colors but not as efficiently as humans. The reason behind this is that they have only two cones in their eyes as compared to the three cones in human eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. The throw of coin&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-360.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;This myth says that when you throw a coin from a high tower, and it hits a passerby. Then it with cause him a serious injury. Well if you believe in this myth then you are really weak in physics. The science behind this myth is that when you throw a coin from a certain height, it has the chance to catch the highest speed of up to 60 mph.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The speed is good enough to hurt someone, but it won’t. It won’t hurt because its weight it too light. So a person getting hit by a coin at a speed of 60 mph might get angry at you but the chances of him getting hospitalized are negligible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Stress causes grey hair:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-361.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;People think that going through immense stress and tension causes the hair to turn grey, and this in turn causes an increase in tension that they take. The myth is nothing more than a misconception. Scientists say that color of your hair depends on the genetic traits rather than the stress factors. So relax, you are not turning into a grandfather while waiting for you exam results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. You cannot swim after you eat:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-362.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;It is a common misconception among people that swimming after a stomach full of food can cause you trouble. The thing is that the problem exists when you are going to compete in a swimming competition. There is no problem in having a light swimming session after dinner or lunch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Ostriches hide their head in sand:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-363.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;How funny is it when you think that ostriches hide their head in sand when they are afraid of something? Well that can cause them to die because of suffocation rather than any other thing. The Roman scientists believed in this myth and added it into encyclopedia. In fact, ostriches do so in order to swallow sand and pebbles to help them digest food. In the situations of threat, they lie down and press their head against ground.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;7. Nero and violin:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-364.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;This story is quite common but if you do not know it then we will tell you about it. The myth relates to a story that in 64 BC when Rome was burned to fire. Emperor Nero was playing violin on top of his castle in deep sorrow. Well we do not want to hurt your sentiments for the emperor but the reality is that he could not play violin. It was not that he did not have the skills. The thing is that violin was invented 1600 years after the tragic incident.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. The opposite attracts:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-365.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;It is a customary belief that opposite attracts and similar repels. This concept applies to the magnets only. Statistically, the best couples in the world are the ones with similar interests, hobbies and routine too. You cannot spend all your life arguing about the things that does not matter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Cats always land on their feet:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-366.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;People do trust the myth that cats always land on their feet when they fall from a height. The science behind this myth is that cats have ability to maneuver their body position while falling and their expanded body acting as a parachute. The ability to change positions while falling allows them to land in their feet. But when the cats fall from a lower altitudes, they cannot land on their legs because they have no time to adjust accordingly. So this myth is partially wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Asteroid belts:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-367.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;This myth emerged from the movies where astronauts leave earth to explore the space or visit some other planet and eventually get crushed in the asteroid belt. Scientifically this is impossible because there is miles of emptiness between two asteroids. Which means that it is not a threat for humans or aliens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Mickey Mouse’s author:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-368.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikimedia &lt;p&gt;Every child grows up and thinks that the author of the most famous mouse in the world, Mickey, was Walt Disney. This is a pure misconception, as the author of Mickey Mouse is “UB Iwerks”. He was known for the speed of his work where he could draw 700 drawings in a single day. Walt Disney was in fact the first one to animate the cartoon though. Walt Disney himself gave his voice to Mickey in the first release.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. The dead sea:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-369.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;It is said that The Dead Sea is the saltiest water body on earth and people cannot drown there because of the salt concentration there. The later statement is a fact while the former is misconception or may be lack of knowledge. Many people ignore the Antarctica in this regard. Most of the geographical and climatic records are held by Antarctica and this one too. The water body Don Juan was discovered in Victoria Land in 1961. It amazed researchers because in was not covered with ice at all, and the reason is that the salt concentration in the lake water does not allow it to freeze.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. 8 hours of sleep:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-370.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com     &lt;p&gt;Almost every person says that sleeping 8 hours every night is essential for the proper functioning of brain and a healthy routine. The fact that lies under this myth is that sleep time depends on subjective preferences. Some people might need 6 hours of sleep only. So do not feel worried if you wake up after 6 hours of sleep. Studies say that people sleeping for 6 hours each night live more and spend a health life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"14 LIES THAT YOU STILL BELIEVE","description":"Do you have doubts regarding the myths that you hear?
