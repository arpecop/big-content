When we live life long enough, we just take everything we get at face value and don‚Äôt question it. However, then something comes along that changes how we see the world, and usually comes with just a snap of a camera. Here are some photos that prove your life is a lie!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Gummy Bears Revelation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-150.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Pixabay.com &lt;p&gt;Gummy bears are some of the world‚Äôs most famous snacks. They‚Äôre sweet, they‚Äôre chewy, they‚Äôre colorful, plus they are so cute and tiny! Based off of the colors, we have figured out what flavor each bear is. Yellow is usually a lemon flavor; red is raspberry, pineapple is colorless and what about green? If you think it is lime, then you are wrong. Green is strawberry! Although it doesn‚Äôt make any sense according to the largest gummy bear manufacturer in the world, their green gummy bears are strawberry flavored, and it has always been that way. So whatever you think you have been tasting your whole life is a filthy lie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Subway is not a foot long&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-151.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur.com &lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôve eaten at Subway before, then you know you can get a Sub that is 6 inches, or even a foot long. For decades, we have never really questioned the company, and just assumed that we were getting what we paid for. But in the last few years, people have gone and measured their foot-long sandwiches and have made a shocking discovery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many Subway foot-longs are not a foot long! Most sandwiches are measuring to about 11 inches, which means that the 6-inch subs are only about 5.5 inches. The incident resulted in a lawsuit that was headed by some people. Subway said that they would start making their bread a true 12 inches long. They still have to pay over $500,000 in legal fees. Plus, it‚Äôs a better move just to do a true foot long since it is a hassle to change the name of their signature sandwich from ‚ÄúFoot-long‚Äù to the ‚Äú11-inch long‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Chicken McNuggets&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-152.jpeg&quot;/&gt;ShutterStock &lt;p&gt;McDonald‚Äôs has had quite a lot of explaining to do when it comes to their chicken nuggets. The fact that they come in pre-designated shapes is sketchy enough as it is especially when the nuggets are supposedly made from chicken breast. But it seems that it more often made from a chicken mixture instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, they come in orders of a very specific number, if you look at the box of what is supposed to hold ten chicken nuggets, you will find there is an eleventh in the picture making you wonder that what‚Äôs up with that? It seems that there‚Äôs some false advertising, it has to be one thing or the other. Of course, if we don‚Äôt have to pay for that extra chicken McNugget then feel free to toss it in and make match the picture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Pouring Milk in the Wrong Way&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-153.jpeg&quot;/&gt;ShutterStock &lt;p&gt;Over the years we have learned to pour drinks from containers with the spout on the bottom, sure there would be some spilling sometimes, but that was to be expected we would think. Well as it turns out you have been pouring wrong your entire life, just because you have been doing it one way your whole life doesn‚Äôt mean that it is the correct way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This only applies to liquids that come in a carton with the spout on one side; this would apply to milk, juices and similar stuff like that. How you should be pouring with little spillage is to have the spout and the top and then start. It looks like it shouldn‚Äôt work, but miraculously it does so next time you see someone pouring the wrong way you can show them the light with the better way to get their liquids with as little spillage as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9.

The late Mike Yurosek, a California carrot agriculturist, created baby carrots in 1986 because most full-developed carrots were too terrible to offer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8.
