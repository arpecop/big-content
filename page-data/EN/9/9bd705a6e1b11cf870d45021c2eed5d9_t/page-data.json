Caring Father&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2283.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;pikabu.ru&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perfect example of how to not disappoint your children but hey, you don’t have to give up your favorite sports or tv shows for that anymore. Now you know what to do when your children invite you for their performances!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;19. The king of sympathy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2285.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;pikabu.ru&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the marathon, the guy trolled the runners. It looked like a genuine sympathetic slogan but when you actually read it, you understand that he is just trolling the poor marathon runners. Trying to trigger the runners eh?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;18. When your neighbor’s house is higher than yours&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;17. The right presentation is everything&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2287.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;pikabu.ru&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a 13-year-old who came up with this idea! Can you believe that? yeah me neither. She found it extremely funny and so decided to troll the poor birthday boy. Now you have to just simply ask people what they want for their birthday and wait for them to say anything so you can prepare for the perfect gift ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;16. A horrible car accident? No! The bus moves like this. There is a passenger car inside&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2289.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;pikabu.ru&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An interesting idea came from one hippie. At first glance, it may seem that the T2 bus has turned over, but it does not just lie on its side, it also rides, on its side. A lot of people were shocked when they saw the buss and then they realized it was just a prank.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For this project, two cars were purchased, Golf 1 and T2, the bus was hooked onto the Golf and it turned out such a miracle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. The person who repairs this porch in the future will be really surprised.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2291.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;pikabu.ru&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone came up with the brilliant idea to just scare people off who would want to repair this porch. They made it look like someone hid a body here and now there’s just a body left. Spooky huh?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. These detective novels are even more mysterious now&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2293.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;imgur&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You want mysterious books? You get them! Now these novels are even more mysterious as you can’t see the book name or the author’s name.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. He had half a scooter as a boy.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2295.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;imgur&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. When Mom asks you to clean the bathroom as if the Queen of England was going to visit it.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2297.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;imgur&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Children come up with pranks all the time and I’m pretty sure this one has crossed all our minds once or twice maybe. Am I right guys? This guy actually worked on the idea and set welcoming cards for the Queen of England everywhere in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. What’s in the front then?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2299.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;pikabu.ru&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Pranking the people behind you in traffic can be the best prank you could think of, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. My parents said we had a brother, but he didn’t like to wash himself and became a mushroom. Here is the proof.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2301.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;imgur&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A parent trolling their kids is the cutest prank ever I’d say. They told their kids they had to shower regularly or they’ll end up like their brother, who didn’t and turned into a mushroom. They even added pictures to the album to support their statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. When you don’t want to pay for your luggage…&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2302.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;pikabu.ru&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t want to pay for your luggage? No worries! Just wear it all. These two adults didn’t want to waste money on paying for the luggage so instead they decided to become the luggage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Sometimes janitors are bored too.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2303.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;imgur&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. You just need to reach up.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2304.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;reddit&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone just played with all the people having restroom emergencies. Hope they all reached out for it and it all worked out for them in the end. Lol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. When you are a lazy but inventive employee:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2305.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;pikabu.ru&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This guy didn’t want to go through the trouble of doing his homework so instead sent himself to a hospital (or at least made it look like that). He plugged his earphones in the nose and took a picture showing the teacher he is in the hospital and therefore, won’t be able to submit the homework.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Love you daddy!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2306.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;reddit&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Risk seeker or a risk averse? That’s your choice to make.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. When your teachers pull a prank&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2307.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;imgur&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Teachers can pull pranks on us kids too alright!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Do you still want an iPad?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2308.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;imgur&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sisterly love is the best, isn’t it? If you don’t troll you siblings are you even siblings?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone just decided to give an eye pad to their sister for her birthday but the prank part is that they gave it in an iPad packaging box. Lol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Let’s start the toenail hunt!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2309.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;seenox&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. My wife asked me to cut the bread, but she didn’t mention how she wanted it cut.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2310.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;imgur&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Always be specific about how you want stuff to be done if you want to avoid this happening.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"12 People Who Can Make You Laugh out Loud Even You Are at a Funeral","description":"  20.
