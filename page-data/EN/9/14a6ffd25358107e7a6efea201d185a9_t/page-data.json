Drew Barrymore:&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; #holidayawareweek @worldfoodprogramme_official this is the girl who changed my life. Edith. I met her on my first trip to Africa with the U.N. Over 10 years ago. I had not had kids yet myself. And my relationship with them was unique because I never really felt like a kid myself and didn‚Äôt have siblings. But she took me into her world. Grabbed my hand and my perception all at the same time. We became close and she single hand-idly opened my heart to children‚Äôs related issues. Because of her, my whole journey changed. Being involved or trying to be philanthropic, caring or aware in any way can be intimidating. But what is important to remember is that 5 dollars. 50 cents. A few hours‚Ä¶ can truly be effective. It can make a huge difference for all involved. Get involved. And happy holidays to everyone. Love as much as you can. Love is free. And kindness is so giving. In any way, shape and form!
