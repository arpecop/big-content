However, some of the people all around the globe are still single who desperately feel the need of having one soul mate, just like everyone else, in this season when everyone is enjoying the holidays to the fullest with their love birds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Singles have always been mocked over the social media in various ways like funny pictures, quotes, or memes. Especially in the contemporary world, where now even 13 years old kids are having their so called “relations”, if you have crossed your 20’s and are still single, get ready for being mocked and laughed at by everyone you know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You might feel the dire need of a partner every other moment but remember that there is always a time for perfect things to happen and that time will come to you soon and that will be the best thing that will ever happen to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All you need to do is a little more wait and show a little more patience than others because good things always require time and patience to come to you. Remember that single is not a status. It is a word that describes a person who is strong enough to live and enjoy his or her life without depending on others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let us tell you the story of Emily Seawright. Emily became viral all over the internet due to her hilarious family’s Christmas card. The card was shared by Emily herself on her twitter timeline. Soon after the card was shared by Emily, there was a lot of laugh and mocking about that card and people started re tweeting it because probably they all could relate to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-650.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Twitter/emilyseawright &lt;p&gt;The card featured Emily’s full family. She, her parents, and sibling are holding play cards. The card portrays everyone’s relationship status other than Emily. One couple has written “Excited” over their card, the other has written “Engaged” over it, and the third one has written “Expecting”. Well, Emily’s situation is very much different as she has written only her name over her card. This is kind of hilarious and all the single people can relate to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Right after Emily tweeted this card; many people like her also started posting pictures about their single lives. All of these were funny in their own individual way but somehow all of these pictures are a depiction of every single person out there. Let us have a look on them below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Brant Gressel Did Something Similar But Before Emily&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-651.jpeg&quot;/&gt;twitter/brantmgressel &lt;p&gt;A young lad on twitter, Brant Gressel, mentioned Emily in his picture post telling her that he had done the same thing with his family before. His picture had everything similar to Emily’s photo except that instead of having “Brant” written on his card he had written “Egg Salad” over it.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;But Samantha Eyth Is the Ultimate Winner&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-652.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Twitter/Samanthaeythh &lt;p&gt;Another twitter user, Samantha Eyth, shared her picture with her Eyth family. This picture, too, was totally similar to the others but Samantha did something even more interesting. She had written “Egg MCmuffin” over her card and was eating one too. What a brilliant idea!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Another User, Morgan Craddock, Is Living the Same Loner’s Life&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-653.jpeg&quot;/&gt;twitter/morgan_craddock &lt;p&gt;Twitter user Morgan Craddock shared her picture showing her family’s relationships and her single life in a very different yet equally funny manner like that of the above mentioned users. In Morgan’s picture, there are two couples other than Morgan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One couple is standing with their baby while the other is standing in a very romantic manner. Lastly, there is Emily who is sitting on a piece of rock looking carefree of all that is going around her. Well this is a true depiction of how single life actually is, yes it is carefree! Be thankful Morgan for you are blessed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bailey Dwyer Is Too Single To Sit On A Double Couch&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-654.jpeg&quot;/&gt;twitter/baileyadwyer     &lt;p&gt;Another user, Bailey, shared her family picture snapped on the occasion of Christmas. Two couple are sitting on the couch all dressed up with their kids. And then there is Bailey sitting on some chair all alone in a cute cap that is totally in accordance to the occasion. The smile on Bailey’s face truly expresses her inner awkwardness amongst the couples.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"This Family's Christmas Card Goes Viral After People Notice One Savage Detail","description":"One family has made a Christmas card and the internet cannot handle it."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/9/c91a93f5290ce6885193bb9a5c128029_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/9/e0be7330d2591b1f41b66c82def79bd9_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"8 Ancient Medical Treatments That Should Stay in the past Forever"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/9/c76cbe111946e1f0aea677a88f4f0859_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"This Company Just Gave Non-Smokers 6 Extra Days off to Compensate for Cigarette Breaks"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
