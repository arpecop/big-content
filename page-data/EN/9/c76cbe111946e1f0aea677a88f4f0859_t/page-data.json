It is not your traditional punishment or nagging that is being used to combat this bad habit but rather the power of an incentive. This incentive is a 6 day holiday on top of the vacation the employees receive if they are non-smokers to counter the time off smokers get to go smoke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This form of motivation is perfect for all the employees that love their holidays and lets just admit it, unless you are a workaholic you love your holidays. Watching other employees cash in holidays to spend time with their family or go on trips abroad could be used as a promising incentive for the smokers as they gaze into the future of what they could have compared to what they have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What they do have are brief moments with that toxic stick that’s giving out smoke good enough to damage their lungs permanently if they don’t stop smoking it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-22.gif&quot;/&gt;giphy &lt;h2&gt;How did they come up with it?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Did you know that almost every company has a suggestion box? And have you noticed that almost every company has that one employee that’s full of bright ideas? The same thing happened in Piala Inc. located in Tokyo, when one of their employees complained about the time the smokers got off which amounted to a total of extra vacation time for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which was technically true as smoking was seen as a valid need and since the employees couldn’t smoke while they worked they had to go to the basement floor and smoke. This complain caught the eye of the boss and he decided to do something good about it. He came up with a theory that would have made skinner proud of him. Positive reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I hope to encourage employees to quit smoking through incentives rather than penalties or coercion,” Piala Inc CEO Takao Asuka told Kyodo News.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Something along the lines of killing two birds with one stone. He was determined that not only will this decrease the amount of smokers present in the office this will also satisfy the non-smokers who were envious of the short breaks that amounted into longer ones, once counted at the end of the week. Who wouldn’t be angry? How did that happen you wonder? Well the company’s head office is on the 29th floor of an office block in the Ebisu district of Tokyo and anyone who wanted a cigarette had to go to the basement, taking around 15 minutes for each trip. Doesn’t sound like much of a vacation if you ask us but then again smoking is not something they would be rewarded for doing.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;How is it going so far?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Small and steady wins the race no? Well the company’s new policy got mixed reactions, majority of them being good. The six extra days started being cashed in by the non-smoking staff leaving the smokers looking on with envy. According to a new observation this new policy has helped at least 4 of the smokers to kick their habit of smoking. 4 might seem like a small number right now but eventually it is going to go up to 10, 15, 30 and so on. Every life matters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How are they thinking about enhancing this?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-724.jpeg&quot;/&gt;asianjunkie.com &lt;p&gt;Over all these years we have seen NGO’s, Societies and environment and health activists come up against one campaign or another to combat smoking and help the world see all the bad it does but were any of these campaigns ever really successful? What was the reason behind their failure? The lack of motivation fueled by incentive can hardly be accounted for the failure of the whole campaign itself as there are many factors that influence it like: How was it conducted? Where was this conducted? What were the external factors that influenced this campaign? All these questions made us realize maybe we should explore the idea of incentive and see what other devices we can come up with and use to help combat smoking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After observing the quick success rates by this particular method, people are coming up with other methods that can be used to give these smokers an incentive to leave the horrible habit that’s not only staining their teeth and fingers but their lungs too. Everyone needs their lungs to survive in a state that’s not black and charred.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of these methods is offering the non-smokers an increase in salary, another option is giving them paid leave. These sound like valid arguments and very motivational incentives but the only issue is that they have with this is the ethical aspect.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Would it be wrong of them to have more money being paid to non-smokers rather than smoking? Although the cause is good would the company risk instability just to have their employees quit smoking itself? Not to mention what if the boss smokes him/herself? Their position as the head and potential role model can also act as a deciding factor for their younger employees and what they think about the habit itself.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"This Company Just Gave Non-Smokers 6 Extra Days off to Compensate for Cigarette Breaks","description":"A company in Japan is giving the non-smokers 6 days off!
