Woman meets man and finds him interesting. They hit it off either instantly or after a few dates. He woos her with his incredible charm and humor and she finds herself spiraling into a relationship. Everything is great and she couldn’t be any happier. But then, almost always, one twist or another comes along.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He either ups and leaves without an explanation or plays the blame game before taking his leave. She may find that she’s been cheated on or may be abused in some other scenario. She gets her heartbroken by someone she was falling for and it rips her existence apart. Very carefully, she learns to pick up the pieces and puts herself back together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1687.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Nothing is worth this pain and effort. No woman goes into a relationship thinking that it will not last long. She is always hopeful and believes that things will work out and the relationship may end up long-term. A relationship is a partnership and requires effort on behalf of both the partners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The woman can carry it along alone as far as she can but even the most strong of women will eventually exhaust. A lot of women find the prospect of looking for love a hard one because they can never tell how long a relationship will last and if the guy is genuinely interested or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1688.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;This is where the universe itself steps in. When we feel clueless in the field of love the universe points out the right path through one of its most beautiful entities: the stars. There are five star signs in particular which carry personality traits making it difficult for women to form a long-lasting relationship with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This does not mean that men with these zodiac signs will never find love or a long lasting relationship. Being with these men requires a lot of hard work and women going into a relationship with them should be aware of this beforehand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Capricorn&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1689.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;It seems that the Capricorn isn’t even sure of what he wants. You will be as confused with them on day 100 as you were on day 10. He will test your patience and tolerance like it’s nobody’s business. They are difficult to understand because their façade is all calm and quiet but the inside is an altogether different story.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;They almost always erect walls around themselves because they do not like feeling exposed and vulnerable emotionally. They are also very cautious when it comes to matters of the heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cancer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1690.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Cancerians are an emotional roller coaster. He may be completely happy one moment but passive aggressive the next. It is also no secret that Cancer men are very attached to their mothers and dating him would be like dating his mother.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They can be emotionally manipulative and will not hesitate from using guilt as a weapon. They are also emotionally clingy, needy and entirely too possessive. With a Cancer, you will never know what you signed up for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Taurus&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1691.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;With the Bull as its star sign, Taurus men are the most stubborn of all Zodiac signs. The most difficult thing about dating a Taurus man is that he will never share his true feelings with you. He will say everything that you want him to say or expect of him but what’s going on inside would be a whole other story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are very loyal to their partners but are emotionally detached which makes it difficult for the women in their life to form an emotional bond with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pisces&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1692.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Pisces are balls of energy but get disinterested and exhausted too easily. They are sensitive and extremely needy emotionally. The woman in a Pisces man’s life better be prepared for holding his hand day in and day out as he vents his feelings about everything and anything under the sky.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They wear their heart on their sleeves and are very dedicated to their partners. However, their emotional dependence is a baggage of its own and they will never be emotionally available for the women in their lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Virgo&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1693.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos     &lt;p&gt;A Virgo man is a temper tantrum waiting to happen. They are very unstable emotionally and take their frustrations out on their partners. They have very little time for tolerance and understanding and always need to get their way.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"The 5 Zodiac Signs That Are Every Woman’s Nightmare","description":"The universe is hinting at something and you better pay attention."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/9/26c41496a3dca3b12a7ee982d6506819_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/9/286792273cfe3013ba367fd5e6a65bb9_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"5 Reasons Why Men Shouldn't Shout at Women in the Street"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/9/183e47e58f20c2578758a073f45601e9_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"14 LIES THAT YOU STILL BELIEVE"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
