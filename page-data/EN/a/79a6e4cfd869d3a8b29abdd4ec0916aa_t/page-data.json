The quality of the images has been improving since the past years as many countries are willing to participate and contribute their share. So let’s explore the list of the year having the most amazing and mind blogging photos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. TIbor Kerczz&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1568.jpeg&quot;/&gt;comedywildlifephoto. &lt;p&gt;The first entry of our list and yet the most exotic one containing three cute owls with two of them trying to look out for something while the third one is just focusing on the camera. I think it believes on the “Say cheese” phenomenon! Sitting merrily on a branch of a tree these owls are looking extremely cute! I think he is just trying to catch our attention by being obnoxious on the other two photographs! What a funny little owl!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Andrea Zampatti&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1569.jpeg&quot;/&gt;comedywildlifephoto &lt;p&gt;Okay next in line is the laughing dormouse trying to sneeze or laugh on that flower! It is difficult to figure out though as to what is it trying to do. The fact that it is trying to sneeze is evident from closed eyes, blown away whiskers and the hands clinging to the flowers! An interesting part is that the tiny teeth are looking hilarious! So give it up for our funny little cupcake dormouse!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. George Cathart&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1570.jpeg&quot;/&gt;comedywildlifephoto &lt;p&gt;The young elephant seal is looking at the other one in this photograph in shock and bewilderment. Seems like the two friends are happily sharing some surprising moment with each other and are shocked at the revelation saying “wtf” man. While the other one is making such an “I don’t care face”. These two prove that friendship is for real and is long-lasting!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Daisy Gilardini&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1571.jpeg&quot;/&gt;comedywildlifephoto &lt;p&gt;This particular one where the polar bears are taking a ride on each other is the most amazing photograph. For a moment my eyes were searching for the image because I thought that this was a snowfall scene. The fact that mama bear is too huge while the baby bear is trying to take a ride on the mama is too cute. It is so cute that I just want the baby bear to come out the photograph and hug me because of course I cannot aim for the mama bear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Carl Henry&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1572.jpeg&quot;/&gt;comedywildlifephoto &lt;p&gt;This picture proves that penguins want to be religious too man! The three of them are heading towards the Church in a line while trying to observe the beauty around as well. Funny, little and cute these penguins just stole my heart while also reminding me that they also want to be close to God!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Douglas Croft&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1573.jpeg&quot;/&gt;comedywildlifephoto &lt;p&gt;This one is amazingly hilarious. I find this fox quite smart because it has identified the perfect spot to poop! The golf course hole is just the right place to poop since it will not spread the litter around!&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;8. Troy Mayne&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1574.jpeg&quot;/&gt;comedywildlifephoto &lt;p&gt;“I will not let anything come in my way” definitely was the thought going on in this turtle’s mind when it was pushing that fish in the sea! I am assuming that this one might be a little angry with someone and is setting out to settle his anger with the turtle! The look on the face of the fish is another story and it looks like the fish is not really happy at being pushed! Well that’s something fishy going on there!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Penny palmer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1575.jpeg&quot;/&gt;comedywildlifephoto &lt;p&gt;Happiness is everything is what this sea otter is trying to convey in this photograph by posing in the victorious way in front of the camera. It is lying happily in the sea swimming and making you feel that you should stay happy in order to appreciate this life!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Bence mate&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1576.jpeg&quot;/&gt;comedywildlifephoto &lt;p&gt;The bears are having their moment in this “caught in the act” photo. They are not even aware of the fact that this one will be circulated around the world making them quite famous. I wish they knew that they have been chosen for being in the winning category of the famous photographs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Lavek Foster&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1577.jpeg&quot;/&gt;comedywildlifephoto &lt;p&gt;These two monkeys seem fed up of the forest conditions that is why they are trying to escape in to the real world. One of them seems quite happy at the prospect of escaping while the other one is in command of the motor bike. So yea monkeys have their own ways to chill and enjoy their own moments! Kudos to them for being this cool!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Oliver Collie&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1579.jpeg&quot;/&gt;comedywildlifephoto &lt;p&gt;“Oops” is the only thing this bunny can come up with! This bunny is trying to eat this grass while it was photographed and man this is another cute picture you can see. Especially those tiny ears are adding up to the cuteness of the photo! So yes our Mr. little bugs bunny is having his own day!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Jean Jacques Alcalay&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1581.jpeg&quot;/&gt;comedywildlifephoto &lt;p&gt;This photo where the wildebeest are moving in a hurdle seems like the armed force which is going to conquer the enemy . The commander is riding on top of the other soldiers because obviously they are moving unarmed. The bomber crew is a typical example of the fact that our army is going to be one strong one! Cheers to the clan and hope they end up achieving their purpose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. John Threlfall&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1583.jpeg&quot;/&gt;comedywildlifephot &lt;p&gt;The fact that “birds fart too” is the message these birds are trying to convey in this photograph, while reminding us they also have needs like humans. The other birds seem to be moving away because who can bear that smell. Apart from jokes this particular one is also quite amazing as it is showing that the four of them are moving towards the same destination flying as high as they can!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Daniel Trim&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1585.jpeg&quot;/&gt;comedywildlifephoto     &lt;p&gt;The mud skippers are trying to sing a song at the top of their lungs and making up quite a show lol See talent cannot be hidden so yea we must try to appreciate it. They are reminding us the fact that happiness can be appreciated anywhere and we must try to enjoy our lives wherever we are!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"14 Funniest Wildlife Photos of 2017 Have Been Announced, and They Will Make Your Day","description":"The wildlife awards are held in order to spread awareness about the wildlife conservation since the year 2015 and is becoming more popular day by day.
