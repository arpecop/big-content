Denying it would be fruitless. Knowing people are going crazy to find cheaper or better alternatives than the usual one is helping the cosmetic world to grow and develop with trends you wouldn’t even dream of trying. Let’s explore what these new trends are like.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;18. Birdy bits:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2334.jpeg&quot;/&gt;greenbeauty &lt;p&gt;Many a times we have panicked at the thought of bird poop falling on us while we sit under a tree seeking shade or what not. Never has anyone heard of people actually rubbing bird poop on their face themselves for a beautiful and healthy glow and a youthful appearance to the skin. Used since the 17th century, for this expensive, Japanese, Geisha facial one needs the poop of nightingales who were specially fed for this job. The main thing this did was bleach the skin as well as repair the prior damages it had done. The stink on the other hand was not worth it. It smelled exactly what you expected poop to smell like!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;17. Fire skin treatment:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2335.jpeg&quot;/&gt;yahoo &lt;p&gt;Did you ever think that you would actually need to get set on fire to actually become hotter? Well neither did we but this new method to beauty will blow your mind or should I say set it on fire. This is a Chinese originated beauty trend where they place actual wine soaked towels on your body and set them on fire! It doesn’t do any harm to your body, quite the opposite actually. It warms the elixir that was primarily applied to your body before placing the soaked towels there. It cures the common cold as well stimulates the skin into regenerating of new cells. Don’t we all just need that eh?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;16. Beer Baths:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2336.jpeg&quot;/&gt;travelaway &lt;p&gt;A gewgaw that was once reserved to add to the glitz and glam for the stars of the music and movie industry, but is now being offered in so many hotels across Europe as a therapeutic treatment. Heated over 30 degrees, the beer yeast, the brewed malt and the mineral elements combine to make a bath that helps sweat the toxins out of your body. This leaves the skin glowing and clears it out immensely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. De-sssssstresss:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2337.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is definitely not for those who have a phobia of snakes, because then the purpose of this is completely ruined hence the name. A shame that many won’t try this because not only is this inexpensive being at 70 dollars per session but is a completely brand new experience and might help you more than any other treatment you have had before. This treatment involves 6 non venomous snakes, sliding over your body while you lay face down and working their magic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. Treating your behind like your front:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-administrator-downloads-31-10-ready-to-dr.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Want to know what is becoming even more important than your face looking perfect? Your behind. Yes that’s right you read that right. People are not obsessed with face lifts as much as they are into butt implants in the year of 2017. It’s not just about making your lower behind look full and perky, it is about making the skin look clear, shiny and taut as well. There are two ways to go about this:&lt;/p&gt;  One is where they use a scrub to clear the dead cells and give your behind a massage Another is where they use a micro current therapy machine (used for face lifts as well) to send bio electric signals to the butt to eliminate any cellulite.  &lt;h2&gt;13. Swimming in red wine:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Do you have a lot of cellulite on your lower behind and love drinking red wine? Well we definitely have something for you that’s going to combine both of those elements together to provide you with a treatment that’s going to help getting rid of your cellulite without you having to do much about it. Vino therapy. Swimming in a tub of red wine or getting a wine wrap at a spa helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles as well as cellulite from your body due to the presence of grape seed oil in it the wine itself. The grape seed oil acts as an anti-oxidant. The wine helps with your skin circulation and provides you with a very healthy looking glow. This is an expensive and a very recent treatment that has generated recently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Dive into chocolate:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2338.jpeg&quot;/&gt;beautynewsindia &lt;p&gt;Like wine isn’t just for drinking, let’s just say chocolate isn’t just for eating either. Chocolate has many benefits and not just for tasting good, but for helping the person losing water weight as well. Feeling fancy? Well microwave dark chocolate chips to make a fine paste. Feeling even fancier? Add a few strawberries or some honey or heck even some champagne to make it even richer. Apply the mixture for no less than 15 minutes for it to take effect. Wrap the areas with plastic for another 15 minutes before rinsing it off with warm water. The chocolate raps are known to moisturize your skin and make it smoother and softer. Don’t forget to give this method a try.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Bull conditioner:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2339.jpeg&quot;/&gt;mnn &lt;p&gt;We wouldn’t want to make you wonder what excretory product of a bull that is being used to condition people’s hair these days. It is much worse than what you think it is. Let’s just say it sounds worse than it really is. Bull’s semen has been known to be a good conditioner most popularly used in a salon located in Knightsbridge called Hari’s Hairdressers. They offer a conditioner which is organically made of bulls semen combined with a protein rich plant Katera. It only costs 7 pounds and you really don’t need to worry about it being stinky because freezing it before use eliminates the threat of it smelling. This treatment has been ironically referred to as Viagra for hair since it brings dead and brittle hair back to life. It also helps make the hair grow out healthier and faster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Suck it up:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2340.jpeg&quot;/&gt;healthcareasia &lt;p&gt;This is hardly a new method, but never has it ever been used to cater to beauty treatments before. Known as leech therapy, it was primarily used for improving blood circulation and getting rid of infections. This new trend on the other hand has altered the process a bit for other purposes. After smothering your body with resin oil, the leeches are placed on your body. When the leeches have drank till their heart is content they are removed leaving you to bleed just a little bit. This is known to detoxify your body from bad blood leaving your skin glowing and clear. Want an example if it really works? Well search for Demi Moore on the internet and you’ll know why she loves this treatment. That woman looks young for her age.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;9. Dermapen facials:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2341.jpeg&quot;/&gt;edinburghbeautyboutique &lt;p&gt;Popularly known as vampire facials, these facials involve taking blood from your arm and injecting it into your face. Sounds more painful than it really is. Soaking your face with your own blood, let’s not pretend we don’t want to appear in an episode of The Vampire diaries. Talking about TV shows, this trend was made popular by Kim Kardashian after she posted a picture of her taking a part in this process. Now we know how she manages to look so youthful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. A snail slide:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2342.jpeg&quot;/&gt;bestthinking &lt;p&gt;Ever felt envious of all those actresses on the television looks perfect and radiant as ever? Well you be like that too only if you don’t mind a couple of snails crawling all over you! No one is a big fan of feeling the snail mucus trail all over them but if it is for a good cause why not? It helps you look younger and gives you firmer skin! Snail mucus contains rich proteins and anti-oxidants that rejuvenate the skin. Instead of actually getting lip injections let the hyaluronic acid in the mucus of a snail work its magic which is basically the same thing that’s present in lip injections but with no side effects. Let’s just say it’s all organic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Placenta therapy:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2343.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;As if bull semen wasn’t enough of a nasty thing to put in your hair, let’s talk about these placenta hair treatments. Putting them on your face is worse but I am sure it is not that fun on your hair either but hey anything for a full head of hair right? Feeling adventurous? Well drive to the nearest beauty supplier and buy this and apply it to your hair! Many women have claimed that this has been extremely helpful in giving their hair moisture and helping it grow thicker and fuller.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Thai gap:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2344.jpeg&quot;/&gt;thewhiskeyjournal &lt;p&gt;Who isn’t obsessed with trying to acquire a body like the ones found on runways or movies? Noticing this the some people opened up a clinic in Texas known as the thigh gap therapy. Inviting many woman desperate to lose the fat embracing their thighs and making them touch. They use laser therapy to eliminate the fat at the thighs and many have claimed that it doesn’t work but people are hopeful anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Bee venom mask:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2345.jpeg&quot;/&gt;truthinaging.com &lt;p&gt;Facelifts have always been in style but there are many people who aren’t entirely comfortable with having needles inserted in their faces but let’s just say Deborrah Mitchell observed this and solved the problem by releasing a product that will have the same effect as botox without the side effects. A bit stingy on the wallet at 55 pounds this mask is made from bee venom that lifts and tightens the facial muscles. Making them firmer and having the same effect as a dose from botox would. Want tighter skin? Go try this out. If the Duchess of Cornwall was ready to endorse this treatment who are we to say no?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Fish feet:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2346.jpeg&quot;/&gt;dmagazine.com &lt;p&gt;Fish really aren’t picky eaters and humans really know how to use this trait of theirs for our own benefit. Everyone has heard of fish pedicures right? The guppy sized fishes chew away the dead and stiff skin from the feet of the people who dip their feet in the tub full of them for this very purpose. Particularly sensitive about your feet? Well this is going to be a giggle fest for you because it really is known to be ticklish. Although this procedure has been banned for being unhygienic because the fish are known to carry a lot of bacteria but people risk it anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Thai face slapping:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2347.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Usatoday.net &lt;p&gt;This might just sound a bit funny but it really is true. Let’s just hold in the giggles till we reach the end of this paragraph. Mostly offered by a masseuse in Bangkok known as Tata who opened up a parlor in San Francisco to carry this treatment out. What this masseuse does is pinch and lightly slap the skin to help remove wrinkles and tighten the skin. Got huge pores? Well this is the treatment for you. It will leave you 350 dollars lighter than you came with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Urine therapy:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2348.jpeg&quot;/&gt;thenaturalhealthonline &lt;p&gt;Did you ever think about having more use of urine than just flushing it away? Well this process is going to make you think twice. There are people who prefer urine for its other uses like drinking it can cure diseases like lupus or its clearance of acne. Although the legitimate medical community hasn’t found any benefits for consuming urine these particular people encourage the use of urine for these purposes. Let’s just wait for a more professional go ahead before resorting to such methods ladies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1.
