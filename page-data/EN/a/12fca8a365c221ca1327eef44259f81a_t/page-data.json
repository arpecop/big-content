This year five of the Brazilian hotties who are trying to prove that they have the best booty in the country; decided to make the show about something less sensual than their behinds.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; #GPRepost,#reposter,#notetag @bumbetoficial via @RepostApp ======&amp;gt; @bumbetoficial:@bumbetoficial, patrocinador oficial do concurso @missbumbumbrasil, presente na final. Parabéns @eurosieoliveira!! #bumbumbet&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Miss Bumbum Brasil (@missbumbumbrasil) on Nov 8, 2017 at 4:35am PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a rather surprising move reminiscing five contestants took the bold decision to wear ‘Beef- Kinis’ reminding one of Lady Gaga’s dress that she wore during the 2010 MTV music Awards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of the eight extremely hot women spent a grand total of eight hours at the shoot. In total the five drop dead gorgeous women are wearing a total of 110 pounds or about 50 kilo grams of beef.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Organizers at the infamous Brazilian beauty pageant said that the message behind the meaty dress to convey a message that women are not just sexual objects and are more than just meat as per reports by SplashNews.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pageant has twenty seven contestants every year representing each of the twenty seven states of Brazil. This year 28 year old reporter and model Rosie Olieveria won the pageant as nationwide millions of people voted over a several month long period to decide who has the best behind in the country. This year however the winner not only has a winning behind but has abs to die for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are some of the other gorgeous ladies taking part in the beauty pageant this year.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;The pageant has been subject to controversy in the past in particular because it Is alleged to objectify women. British Journalist Daisy Donovan who works with the highly respected channel 4 news service claimed in June 2013 that Television shows in the South American nation such as Miss Bumbum and others like it tend to not just objectify women but such programs also degrades them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Daisy Donovan said that the show was “a spectacular feast of the flesh”. She said that watching the final was an extremely awkward affair for her and further said that “It’s a bit disconcerting being a woman here and not dressed in dental floss.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Corruption is also not a rarity across Brazil and the Miss Bumbum contest has faced corruption allegations. In October 2013, according to the International Business Times contestants; 24 year old Eliana Amaral and 25 year old Mari Sousa were both accused of bribing judges to the tune of thousands of US dollars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, pageant organizers have been known to be publicity hungry and it would not be wrong to say that the entire episode may have been just a publicity stunt in order to promote the pageant. In particular in order to try to salvage the pegeant’s image as it considered to be a misogynistic degradation of women by many people especially feminists and women rights activists are in uproar at the blatant objectification of the bodies of women.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Candidatas ao Miss Bumbum fazem ensaio para apoiar o Outubro Rosa O movimento mundial Outubro Rosa vem ganhando força a cada ano. A população se veste em tons de rosa para chamar atenção e mostrar a importância da luta contra o câncer de mama. Esse câncer é o que mais mata mulheres em todo mundo e é preciso sempre lembrar a importância do diagnóstico precoce: quando descoberto no início, há 95% de probabilidade de recuperação total. O concurso Miss Bumbum está em sua 7• edição e trouxe diversas mudanças, como o limite máximo para o bumbum e a participação de estrangeiras. As votações acontecem até o dia 29 de outubro e evento da final acontece em São Paulo, no dia 06 de novembro.
