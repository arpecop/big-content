The unconditional and unrestricted love we have for our sibling should not be underestimated. Even more than parents or friends, our brothers and sisters have been on our side through, embarrassing, awkward, joyous and miserable times of our lives. Our siblings were the one who without even direct conversations, have always been listening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that siblings have a special bond which cannot be explained, but there are some examples of siblings around the world, who are just truly amazing and exceptional. Today we discuss some of the examples of siblings who are one in a million.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Japanese Twin sisters, Gin &amp;amp; Kin&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-564.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Top10hq &lt;p&gt;The first example of an exceptional sibling is Gin Kanie and Kin Narita from Japan whose name means silver and gold respectively. These identical twins were born on 1 August 1892 in Nagoya, 270km (170 miles) west of Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The twins only became famous when they were 99, after the mayor of Nagoya visited them on Respect for the Aged Day. The day is a national holiday in Japan, where life expectancy is the highest in the world, and older people command considerable respect. The twins soon started to appear on television game shows and advertisements. Their broad smiles and lively interest in the world around them endeared them to people in Japan and abroad. Aged 102, they made their first trip abroad, visiting Taiwan, where they were greeted by more than 1,000 pairs of twins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The twins said that the simplicity of their lives, their frequent walks and each other’s company kept them healthy into their second century.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We never thought we would live this long,” said Kin on the twins’ 100th birthday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We could survive because we were twins. We need each other more than anyone else in the world.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kin Narita died in the year of 2000 at the age of 107 and Gin Kanie died one year after her sister in 2001 at the age of 108. They became media celebrities in their final decade, charming the Japanese public with their wit and lust for life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Black and White Siblings&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Black &amp;amp; white twins Hayleigh and Lauren Durrant proudly hold their new sisters Leah and Miya — who incredibly are ALSO…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Posted by Talking Babies on Wednesday, April 8, 2015&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another example of one in a million siblings is of Lauren and Hayleigh Durrant. These two sisters are also twins, but what makes this set of twins so unique, is that while being identical, their skin and hair color are in fact different. While Lauren is light skinned, with blue eyes and red hair, like her mother; her sister Hayleigh has dark skin and dark hair like their father.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When their parents, Allison and Dean Durrant who are a mixed-race couple from Britain, gave birth to the twins in 2001, they were shocked to see that their girls were also biracial. Years after giving birth to Lauren and Hayleigh, the couple found out that they were expecting once more. Little did they know, the amazing story of their first-born twins was about to happen again in 2009.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The curious case of Abby and Brittany&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Abby and Brittany Hensel (@abbyandbrittany) on Sep 16, 2012 at 8:00am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Abigail and Brittany Hensel are conjoined twins from Minnesota. Being conjoined, they have had many struggles throughout their lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Abby and Brittany are one of the rarest set of dicephalus twins in the world! It is very rare to be born conjoined (1 in 40,000) and it is even rarer to survive after birth (1% of the 1 in 40,000)! The fact that Abby and Brittany are alive and well is a miracle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They have two hearts, two spines joined at the pelvis, four lungs, two throats, three kidneys, one ribcage, one liver, a halfway shared sensory system and a common circulatory framework. From their waist down, all organs are shared including the reproductive organ, intestines and bladder. Abby, the right twin can’t feel anything on the left half of body while Brittany, the left twin can’t feel anything on her right side. Despite the fact that the twins can only feel their half of the body they share, they still are able to type, play piano, bowl, play volleyball, ride a bicycle, play softball, and swim, etc&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The twins have been in the media several times in their lives. At the age of six, they appeared in Oprah Winfrey show and on the cover of Life magazine. They stayed out of the media for 10 years, and then when they were 16 the girls were filmed for a TLC documentary. If features them passing their driver’s test; each twin controls the steering wheel with one arm. Their mother wondered which twin would get the speeding ticket if they were ever pulled over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Born together, Raised apart&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-565.jpeg&quot;/&gt;People.com &lt;p&gt;This is a case of Jim Springer and Jim Lewis, they are identical twins who were separated at birth and adopted by separate families. The coincidently have the same first name instead of the last, however the coincidences between them does not end just yet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So began their parallel lives, growing up in different homes, both were aware, barely, that they had a twin brother out there somewhere, but neither gave it much thought. Springer’s mother told him his twin had died, while Lewis simply wasn’t interested in meeting his brother.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That changed in 1977, when Lewis, then 37, decided to track down his brother. He found Springer’s name through a local courthouse, and the two of them spoke over the phone, both of them nervous wrecks. They agreed to meet, and their bond was restored on February 9,1979. Now, both consider their reunion the most important day of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Once they started talking and opening up with each other, they discovered the shocking similarities and coincidence between each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both were adopted by families living in Ohio and grew up within 45 miles of each other. Both had childhood dogs they named “Toy.” Both were married twice — first to women named Linda, and then to women named Betty. Both had children — including sons named James Allen. Both lived in the only house on their block. Both were chain-smokers, enjoyed beer, had woodworking shops in their garages, drove Chevrolets, and served as sheriffs in separate Ohio counties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Due to these similarities, they became the perfect candidates for behavioural research. he two participated in a study of reunited twins conducted by Dr. Thomas Bouchard of University of Minnesota. In one test measuring personality, the twins’ scores were so close that it may well have been the same person taking the test two times. Their brain-wave tests were similarly near-identical, as were their medical histories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Twins Deliver Twins&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-566.jpeg&quot;/&gt;rebelcircus &lt;p&gt;In the year 2005, 20 year old twins, Ashlee Spinks of Indianapolis and Andrea Springer of Conyers, Ga delivered their twin babies about an hour apart. Two twin sisters are seeing double — or make that quadruple — after delivering two sets of twin boys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both the women were six months pregnant when they found out that they will be having a set of twins each due on the same date which was 1st January 2005.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both the sisters claimed that the twin genetics run in the families of all four parents and that they have not used any sort of drugs for conceiving twins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The McGuire Twins&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, #ChrisChristie, shrieking, escapes down unlit corridor in #Trump tower, but is tackled, and dragged back by two even larger men.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Werner Twertzog (@WernerTwertzog) March 18, 2016&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Billy Leon McCrary and Benny Loyd McCrary also known as the McGuire Twins were professional wrestlers and were listed as the worlds heaviest twins by the Guinness Book of World Records. The twins had a combined weight of 666 kilogram which is 1468 pounds. Billy and Benny were born in Hendersonville, North Carolina, on the 7th of December 1946. In 1979, Billy died of a motorcycle accident at the age of 32. Whereas Benny lived for 21 more years, he died at the age of 54 of a heart failure in 2001.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Husain and Khardra&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-567.jpeg&quot;/&gt;thetallestman &lt;p&gt;Hussain Bisad was in 1975 in Somalia, but he fled the country after getting shot and took asylum in Britain. Hussain being 7 feet and 7.5 inches, shortly after arriving in England took the title of the tallest man. He also claimed the record of having the largest hands measuring at 26.9 centimetres long.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, as tall as Hussain may be, tallness does not run in Hussain’s family. Hussain also has a twin sister named Khardra and she is the complete opposite to her brother in terms of height. While Hussain maybe taking titles for being the tallest man in England, his twin sister is below the average height of women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lucy and Maria Aylmer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-568.jpeg&quot;/&gt;DailyMail &lt;p&gt;This is the second example in our list of mixed racial twins. Lucy and Maria Aylmer who are 20 years old from Gloucester are non-identical twins. Maria has a dark skin with curls and Lucy is fair skinned with ginger hair. With such opposing looks it’s hard to believe this striking pair is sisters. But they are much more than that – they are twins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The girls were born with radically different complexion and colour thanks to a quirk of their mixed-race parents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maria and Lucy Aylmer’s father Vince is white and their mother Donna is half Jamaican, and they managed to deliver one white and one black twin together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;June &amp;amp; Jennifer Gibbons&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-569.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Unbelievable-facts &lt;p&gt;These twin sisters grew up to be known as the ‘The Silent Sisters’ as the only communicated with each other and no one else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;June and Jennifer Gibbons were born in April eleventh, 1963 in Barbados. Not long after they were born, their family moved to Haverford west, Wales. While growing up the two sisters wound up plainly inseparable. They even chatted with each other in abnormal, fast, patois-like English which nobody else could comprehend, not even their parents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While growing up, the twins were the only black kids in their community. Because of their race, they were bullied and tormented at school. This ended up being a traumatic experience for the twins driving them to maintain a strategic distance from correspondence with others and just talking with each other in a dialect which was practically incomprehensible to any other person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The twins were sent to various different therapists due to their resistance to speak with the outsiders. However, none of the professional therapists could enable the twins to talk to others. The twins were even sent to different boarding schools just to break their habit but this separation resulted them to become even more withdrawn and catatonic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Teun and Koen&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-570.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Top10hq     &lt;p&gt;This pair of twin brothers was named as the least alike twins in the Twins Festival in Ohio. The twins were a product of vitro fertilization, to a Dutch couple Wilma and Willem Stuart. They were born in 1993, Koen was black while his brother Teun was white. It was later demonstrated that while Teun was unquestionably Wilma and Willems child, Koen wasn’t. A terrible blunder by the hospital had brought about another man’s sperm getting mixed with Wilma’s fertilized eggs. Joyfully, both young men share a profound bond and are cherished by their parents.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Incredible True Stories About Twins","description":"A Discussion on Some of the Examples of Siblings Who Are One in a Million"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/a/50011b29848a5779e75694be237d59aa_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/a/565101de610e59ca10c5157972e999aa_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"18 Strange Beauty Treatments You Can Get Today"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/a/4f9942278ab89bffef0c429be40e88da_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"15 Tweets Celebs Were Forced to Delete"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
