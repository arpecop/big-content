We may read our horoscopes for fun or actual guidance. However, not everyone would know that our zodiac signs could actually tell us something about how we perform in bed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s right; our sexual powers may just come from the sign under which we were born. Sure, there are several other factors that contribute to this aspect of our lives. Still, it can’t hurt to read up on just about anything that could help us impress our partner in bed. So read on and get some guidelines on what the stars say we’re good at:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-44.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Afraid are usually the spontaneous ones when it comes to doing the hanky panky. When they want something, they would generally not hesitate in trying their best to get it. This may be delightful for their partners, who may feel very attractive with how an Aries showcases just what they want.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re an Aries, you may want to think more about what the other person wants as well as fulfilling your own needs and desires. Saying what you want to happen is all well and good, but listening to the other person makes the experience even better. This way, you would be sure to have a fulfilling and satisfying physical relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-45.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;The bull sign is usually a wizard at making the mood for a wonderful sexual experience. When they’re in the mood, then, they would be likely to light candles, put on some soft music, and scatter rose petals. Hopefully, this would also turn on their partner and get things going in no time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, there are downsides to this sort of behaviors. One may start expecting the same thing of their partners. This habit may also lower the spontaneity of a relationship if one gets too dependent on it. Hence, it is recommended that you indulge in the tone-setting, but not be governed by it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-46.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Geminis are generally known as the intellectuals among the sigs. They would also be able to talk their way in and out of any situation. Of course, they wouldn’t be true Geminis if they weren’t able to have the same skills when it came to their physical needs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hence, one can expect a Gemini to have some hardcore dirty talk going on in the bedroom. They would also be open to discussion on fantasies, kinks, and overcoming fears with their partners. This may lead to both partners working out how to give and receive the best time of their lives. So when you’re with a Gemini, you may prepare for some role play and risk-taking!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-47.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;The sign of the crab is a deeply sensitive and emotional one. Cancers hence usually go into their shell and rarely come out unless they’re completely comfortable. They may hence shy away from being too voluble or outspoken when it comes to sexual matters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the upside, this sort of quietness does hide a lot of spirit. Most of the hiding away is for protecting themselves. When Cancers find out that they have no need to do so with their partner, watch out! The resulting lovemaking can be quite hot and heavy, even if it takes time to get there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-48.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Of course, this fiery sign has its own share of drama, love of spontaneity, and a strong romantic streak. If you’re a Leo, you would probably go big and bold on the lovemaking. You would be starting with candles, foreplay, lingerie…the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The gestures with a Leo are large and loving, and there’s no second-guessing their advances. There might be quite a bit of drama and foreplay involved as well. This would keep both partners interested and into each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-49.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Just because it’s called ‘doing the nasty’ doesn’t mean one has to be hardcore about it. There’s a caring and caring side to sex as well, and probably no one emulates it better than Virgos. Virgos tend to get attached very quickly in matters of the heart. They show these emotions in and out of bed, and their partners should highly appreciate them for it.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;If Virgos do get seriously attracted to their partners, they should get ready for a sexual roller coaster in bed. Those born under this sign could be serious sexual wonders when put to the test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-50.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;If there even was a sign to put some serious thought into their relationships, it’s this one. The thinking part doesn’t go away even when their heart is pounding and they’re raring to get it on. The Libras, hence, would not usually want to take a relationship to the next level until and unless they’re really sure about it. So if one shares a bed with them, they may almost be sure of a serious commitment. Of course, this all depends on one’s belief in the governance of zodiac signs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Libras would put in quite a bit of hard work in the physical aspect of a relationship too. They would find out just what their partner likes and make sure to master that skill. The lucky people they o to bed with are thus wholly satisfied at the end of the experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-51.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Scorpios are generally known for their highly charged emotions. When they do feel something, they feel it with a vengeance. In a relationship, this could mean mad love, crazy sex, and absolute focus on the other person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So if someone is with a Scorpio, they can expect all kind of favors in bed. This is because this sign doesn’t mess around when it comes to pleasuring those they care for. However, they may not be able to express their own needs so much. It is hence up to their partner to make them realize that they have anything of the sort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-52.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Sagittarians are notoriously known for breaking hearts wherever they go. They may treat the sexual aspect of a relationship like a game. However, they would make it a good and sincere game if they really care about someone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, Sagittarians may even perform amazingly because of the goal they have in mind. They could hence want to have the best experience or give their partner one, or both.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-53.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Here’s where things might start getting a little chilly. Capricorns may come off as a bit stand-offish to their partner when it comes to doing it. More often than not, though, that’s just a wall they put up to avoid heartbreak or embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Capricorns let go of their reservedness, things can get quite crazy in bed. Their partners should hence prepare for being the center of attention. Capricorns would take them on a wild rise and never come back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-54.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;The Aquarians are wild in bed, no two ways about it. They know what they want to do, and they’re not afraid to go crazy if it’s required. However, they could also seem a bit withdrawn at times. Still, they’re usually all right with trying out new things. One can get very weird with these kinds of partners, but in a supremely good way!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-55.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;When a Pisces gets frisky, they’re usually very empathic about it. They focus most of their energies on finding out what their partner wants. Then they make sure to remember this information and use it as much as possible. They are very sensitive and caring in this aspect. They may even have the ability to know what their significant other would like without much of an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Every individual has their own unique personality. Still, a little reading on what the signs have in store for us is fun, if nothing else. The above strengths describe for each sign just may motivate and inspire your performance in the future.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"This Is What Makes You Good in Bed, According to Your Zodiac Sign","description":"If you believe in the influence of zodiac signs, you may wonder what they say about your expertise in bed.
