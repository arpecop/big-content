Instead she made a covering for it and is now using it as her butter dish. Besides, putting in butter she also sometimes cleans it from a dry cloth and uses it as a cheese dish or to save some strawberries. Since the day this idea of her became successful, she is trying it with all the other boxes in home.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1637.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Reddit &lt;h2&gt;10.
