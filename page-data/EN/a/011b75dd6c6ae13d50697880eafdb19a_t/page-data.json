Now, you don’t understand how funny that can be. Just scroll down and you will find yourself laughing on the ground.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is a list of singers who had to wear some virtual clothes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1 # Shakira&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shakira Isabel Mebarak is her full name and she was born on the 2nd of February in 1977. She is a Colombian by ethnicity. She is not just a singer but a songwriter, record producer and a dancer. She was raised in Barranquilla where she started exploring her talent in school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-426.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Amazon &lt;p&gt;Her music and talent revolved around more around Arabic, rock &amp;amp; roll and Latin American decent. She is known for her belly dancing abilities, and that is why she stood out like a sore thumb amongst other singers of her time. Her initial albums failed but she rose from her fourth album.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-427.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Amazon &lt;p&gt;After that she decided to sing in English – and that was her greatest decision. She sold millions of albums and became world famous. But unfortunately the creativity she put into her album covers was not accepted by the whole world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-428.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Amazon &lt;p&gt;In order to sell her album in the Middle East, they had to censor her covers because they were too revealing. Middle Eastern countries expect a little more modestly, even in music.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-429.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Amazon &lt;p&gt;It is hilarious how the strategically placed leaves on her body parts had to be multiplied all over her body to cover it. Clearly they don’t want their audience seeing her chiseled stomach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-4.gif&quot;/&gt;Giphy &lt;h2&gt;2 # Britney Spears&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Britney Spears was born on December 2nd in the year 1981. She is one of the highly credited teen pop icons of the late 90’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-430.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Amazon &lt;p&gt;In no time she reaches the top of the charts with her bestselling songs and was the most selling teenage artist of her time. She was given titles like ‘Princess of pop’ and received many awards and even accolades such as the Grammy Award and the MTV Video Music Award.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-431.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Amazon &lt;p&gt;She is also present in the Hollywood walk of fame. She was in the 8th position on the billboard and came fifth in general. Not many people know that she was a child star in television shows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-432.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Amazon &lt;p&gt;Moving on, when she became world famous – her albums were to be sold in the Middle East and for that they required modestly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-433.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Amazon &lt;p&gt;The Photoshop is done in a funny manner, and in one case – her whole body is cropped out of the picture without any effort being put in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-5.gif&quot;/&gt;Giphy &lt;h2&gt;3 # Lady Gaga&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lady Gaga’s real name is Stefani Joane Angelina. She was born on 28th March in 1986. She is an American and known for her singing, acting ad songwriting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-434.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Amazon &lt;p&gt;She is known to be very contemporary and for experimenting with creative ideas. How she portrays herself is something dark and stands out, not hard to notice at all. A lot of people find her work to be provocative.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-435.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Amazon &lt;p&gt;She started her career from singing at open mic nights at different places. She studied music at the New York University and her hit albums were of the electro-pop genre. She posted for her album completely naked with a ball between her legs. The Middle Eastern world would not be able to handle that so they increased the size of the ball and make her wear leggings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-6.gif&quot;/&gt;Giphy &lt;h2&gt;4 # Selena Gomez&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her full name is Selena Marie Gomez, she was born on the 22nd of July in 1992. She started her career very early as a child actress in television series.

She released her solo album in 2013 and ended up being in the top ten singles. The star sold about seven million albums and her singles were about twenty two million.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-437.jpeg&quot;/&gt;iTunes &lt;p&gt;She even has her own clothing line and a fragrance. She is known for her charitable work from the age of 17.She has also won many awards in her career, from American Music Award and People’s Choice Award. Coming to her album being censored, they really didn’t like her wearing less clothes so they photo-shopped some.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-7.gif&quot;/&gt;Giphy &lt;h2&gt;5 # Mariah Carey&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mariah was born on the 27th of March and she is known to be a singer, record producer, songwriter and actress. She rose up to fame due to her eponymous debut album.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-438.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Amazon  &lt;p&gt;She became successful after four of her songs topped the charts and she was confirmed as a highest selling act in the ‘Columbia Records.’ One of her songs also remains the ‘longest running number 1 song’ on the US chart history.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-439.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Amazon  &lt;p&gt;He sold millions of albums and has a record breaking deal with Virgin Records. But when she became world famous, the Middle East had to make her put on some clothes before they sold the album in their markets. They really have some talent in making people wear clothes.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-8.gif&quot;/&gt;Giphy &lt;h2&gt;6 # Nirvana&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As we all know, Nirvana was one of the most popular bands in American rock history. The lead of that band was Kurt Cobain who committed suicide at the peak of his career and fame.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-440.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Amazon &lt;p&gt;He made sure that the world remembered him as a legend. Although it only released three full albums, it is still known to be the most influential bands in history.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-441.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Amazon &lt;p&gt;It still has a following although the band does not exist, as after Kurt’s death the band did not continue making music – and respected his memory and work. The album called ‘Never mind’ had a baby in the pool – now no one thought that even he would need to wear a photo shopped underwear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-9.gif&quot;/&gt;Giphy &lt;h2&gt;7 # Madonna&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now do we even need to introduce Madonna?

She used to sing in church was she was a child and kept working through till the top.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-449.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Amazon &lt;p&gt;She made an album that covered her with clouds, but clearly those areas were not enough. The Middle East had to use a little more clouds to cover all of her body. Now you roll all over the floor.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;The list does not end there, here are a few more examples of how the modestly takes over album covers when it goes to other countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10 # Geri Halliwell&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-450.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Amazon &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-451.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Amazon &lt;h2&gt;11 # Kylie Minogue&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-452.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-453.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;h2&gt;12 # Jennifer Paige&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-454.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Amazon &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-455.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Amazon   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"12 Music Covers for Middle East Censorship","description":"You can’t believe what all was photo Shopped on to these covers"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/a/011b75dd6c6ae13d50697880eafdb19a_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/a/058b50c01fd3d0a6676a55582cec567a_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"6 Simple and Ingenious Magic Tricks Anyone Can Easily Learn to Do"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/a/008b1b3c3d2f0eb51f9196462997be1a_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"This Couple’s Wedding Photo Captures Two Generations of Long-Lasting Love"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
