Here is where they could go wrong is, not all guys are the same and they all have different things they like and things they don’t like. Although this. Most guys secretly have their own little ways how they fall in love with someone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you think of how someone might fall in love with you, you might think of personality traits or looks wise, etc. But there are more to love than just that. Read about this on the 15 ways to make them fall for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. When you are getting ready together.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-614.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;They like to take a look at what is theirs. They enjoy what they see even if it is your imperfections. They still will think of you as beautiful as can be. They love to see you off guarded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. Receiving and sending notes.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you write to someone, things might be easier to write or type than to say them in person. In this case, explain to him how you feel about them or how much you care about them. They want to feel loved by you and this could be easier because you are writing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Jam out to the same music.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-615.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;You tend to like people that have the same music taste because you can relate with them more. You might be feeling the same way for the type of song or the lyrics in the song.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. It’s all about the eyes.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-616.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Looking into someone’s eyes shows how intimate you will be with the person. Just looking straight into their eyes shows honesty and faithfulness, which eyes will love and appreciate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Always be there for him through thick and thin.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-617.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;When we are vulnerable most of the time we tend to open up to others when we normally don’t. This is great time to get closer with him because he appreciates you being there for him in a tough time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Small little peaks “kisses”.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-618.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Sometimes less is more. So, giving a small kiss could have more to say rather than such an intense kiss with no meaning behind it.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;9. Having your awkward moments with him.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Its normal to have awkward moments but it’s even more awkward when you are trying to hide them. Laughing it out with him should make the situation and your relationship much better. He would really love that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Random noises you might make.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Making small noises while you are only with him will make him see that you only act like this with him. You don’t mind showing off your weirdness to him even if it isn’t intended to be shown. He likes to see this in you because it makes you different than the others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. When your feet might touch.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-619.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;This might make him fall in love with you because your feet are sensitive and you have a weak spot on them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. OCD kicks in with you.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;you have strict rules with what you want to go down. You know how you want something and you only want it done that way. If not he knows he will be hearing an earful with you, which he is okay with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Paying attention to things he didn’t know you paid attention to.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is important to your relationship so that he knows how serious it is. Remembering not only the big things in a relationship but also remembering the small things does mean a lot to them because you wouldn’t haven’t paid attention if you didn’t care about them and the situation that he is in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. LAUGH.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-620.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Laughing will make them fall in love with you because they know that they are making you happy in a sense of you dying of laughter. They want to see you smile and just be happy in general.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Out of the blue texts that blow your mind.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To make a man fall in love with you, he would love to see how much he really means to you. Shooting up a special text to show him how much you care is the key to a happy man.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Shock him.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s be real who doesn’t like surprises. A couple surprises and you should be good to go!! Who would like to be in a boring relationship where everything is predictable. NO ONE.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Be intellectual.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-621.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock     &lt;p&gt;Who doesn’t want a girl that is smart. Sometimes they need a little smart talking just to stupid them up. boys like when you read informational stuff to them that have background facts that have been proven.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"15 Men Reveal The Little Things Women Do That Make Them Fall In Love","description":"Females tend to feel as if they know exactly what guys want in them.
