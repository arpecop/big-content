One so immersive the device itself disappears into the experience. And so intelligent it can respond to a tap, your voice, and even a glance. With iPhone X, that vision is now a reality. Say hello to the future.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; ئایا دەزانیت نرخی چاککردنەوەی شاشە(ڕونما)ی ئایفۆن ئێكس ٢٧٩دۆلارە وریایبە کە کڕیت 😀 #iphoneX #kurdishtechnology&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Kurdish Technology (@kurdishtechnology11) on Oct 31, 2017 at 12:23am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the iPhone X was first launched we were all amazed by what an advanced technology it boasted. It seemed so revolutionary and we instantly bought into all the hype that surrounded this latest launch in the Apple series. It has made some huge claims and brought forth completely new technology for phone like TrueDepth camera, Animoji, augmented reality, and AirPower among other ground-breaking and innovative additions. It claims to create a world like never seen before and we will have the front row seats of when Apple fulfills these claims.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It all sounds very futuristic and most of us cannot comprehend how iPhone X is going to shift the way we operate phones and life through phones. However, just because something is the latest tech around doesn’t mean it is also the greatest or the best fit. Following are ten surprising reasons why you should NOT bring this baby home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Standard brainpower&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2311.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Why do we usually want a new upgrade in our smartphone? Because the older one seems to get slower with time and the new seems so much faster! Imagine the time I’d be able to save while sending work emails if my current phone wasn’t showing a 2 or 3 second lag, right? If you are thinking about shifting from an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 plus to iPhone X because it’d be faster then let me stop you right there. The iPhone X uses the same A 11 bionic chip and M 11 motion co-processor as iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 plus. All of these phones also run on the same iOS 11 so ay apps that you might think would work better on iPhone X would work just as fine on its other models. iOS 11 rolled out with a smarter Siri, introduction of Apple’s new Files app and subtle design enhancements along with plenty more features and it would have given your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 plus a significant upgrade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Face ID&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What could be more natural than a touch? A look.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2312.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The smartphones revolutionized our life when they came up with touch ID. We were dumbfounded, taken and smitten by that advanced technology when it came out and rushed to the stores to get our iPhones and set up a touch ID feature right away. This technology has been around for a while now and there hasn’t been much advancement in this regard. However, Apple is claiming to shake the tech industry once again with its bold statements about facial recognition. It claims that your face is now your password and it is a new way of unlocking your device through secure authentication. This is achieved with the help of face mapping that is enabled and set up with the help of TrueDepth camera, another new feature. However, these claims have not been proven as yet in the hands of the average consumer. If you compare the time and energy it is going to take to lift a phone to your face, swipe to turn it on and then unlock it to that of simply using your finger for touch ID and unlocking, the face ID is going to feel cumbersome and impractical eventually&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Security&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2313.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;There has also been serious backlash from people who believe that their facial recognition data could be stored in database and possibly used by third parties. Apple denies these allegations vehemently, as it did when similar concerns were raised about the touch ID data storage. Right now you are not required by law to give police officers the password for unlocking your phone. But there is no law from preventing an officer to simply holding it up to your face and getting it unlocked. Such concerns have made security experts extremely vary and doubtful of this new feature.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;7. It’s all screen&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2314.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;For some people, the screen is one of the most desirable upgrades that they look for. For the longest time, Apple didn’t pay much attention to its screen as compared to other android devices. That has changed recently and now Apple is all about bezel edges and screen to body ratio which has improved to 83% for iPhone X. 5.8 inches of OLED multi-touch with fingerprint resistant oleophobic coating and Super Retina HD display, this screen is ALL glass! Although Apple claims it is the strongest glass they have ever used, it doesn’t mean it is made of magic and won’t ever break. If you drop your brand new iPhone X on the curb and your heart jumps to your throat, there isa good reason why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. The Notch&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2315.jpeg&quot;/&gt;cdn.vox-cdn.com &lt;p&gt;You’d think that anything with the word notch in it would also have ‘top’; top notch. It is but not in the sense you might think. There is a notch on &lt;em&gt;top &lt;/em&gt;of the wildly expensive and supposedly mind-blowing iPhone X screen and we cannot wrap our heads around it. The seamless display which a huge screen boasts of is smeared with this flat notch on the top and because it is used with the face ID system, there is nowhere else they can put. But with the best designers working for Apple, you’d think they could have at least tried to camouflage it better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. But where’s Home&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2316.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;With the iPhone X, there is no way home, literally. The first thing you will notice on an iPhone X screen is that they have done away with everyone’s trusted Home button. It was a handy and easy way of exiting any open app and getting back to our home screen in an instant. Now instead of that, you have to learn a series of new gestures and rely on them to be perfect every single time to be able to reach the home screen. Swiping is more cumbersome than pressing a simple button. We really don’t understand how that is an upgrade and it feels more like a step back in terms of features.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Two handed operation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2317.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The last time we used two hands to work a phone was back when slide-out keyboards were still a thing. As they have done away with the traditional and beloved Home button, to activate Siri you would have to press and hold one of the buttons on the side. With a 5.8 inch screen, managing to do so will be a feat in itself unless you have a pair of extra-large hands. Did we mention the screen is all glass and there is a good chance it might slip and fall when you are fumbling with calling upon Siri one-handedly?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Complexity&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2318.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;To work an iPhone X, you will have to learn a ton of new gestures to use it like you would any other iPhone. Besides the absence of Home button and swiping, there are a dozen other ‘upgraded’ features which would require you to re-familiarize yourself with the new and improved iPhone X. One of the reasons people of all ages were drawn to the iPhones were because their use was so streamlined and effortless. The new iPhone X is going to be very complicated to use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Price&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2319.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Sure there has been a hike in iPhones over time but that is understandable as everything as gotten pricier with time. iPhone X isn’t just expensive. It is an investment. You can get an iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 plus for $700 or $800 but for an iPhone X you’ll have to spend hundreds more with it being priced at a $1000. And these are essentially the same phones! Even Apple care costs more for iPhone X at $199 as compared to the normal $120 for other models.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. The risk&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2320.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock     &lt;p&gt;Don’t worry, your phone breaking and a $1000 going down the drain isn’t the risk we are talking about. With the iPhone X, Apple has introduced a lot of new technology and features that we have just discussed and it is asking you to invest in those. If these features were not received well by the everyday user or if the technology were to fail in making daily tasks smoother as they claim. If their new technology fails to meet standards and people’s expectations then they are clearly going to feel as if they have thrown away a $1000 on a phone which is a struggle to even unlock properly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Surprising Reasons You Should Never Buy the iPhone X","description":"To buy or not to buy?"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/a/230f0162fa3f71770c905ad0d687559a_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/a/246a69e89b3558d10f9dcb6cf071b33a_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"8 Things Selfish People Do in a Relationship"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/a/20f1df0f5c47e320d86595c2202e69ca_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Judge Asks What ‘Thot’ Means in Trial of Man Accused of Groping Woman at Christmas Party"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
