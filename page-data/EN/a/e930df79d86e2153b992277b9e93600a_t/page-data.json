This is no mean feat, but the timeless lyrics and tune of this work make their magic felt. However, as it often is with songs and music, the background to this song is heartbreakingly tragic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By looking at the song in some detail and reading up on its story, one can somewhat understand its true essence. Below is a discussion which would probably make one never feel quite the same way about this song ever again. You have been warned!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. A Good Atmosphere for Popularity&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1547.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;This song was both penned and composed by one Irving Berlin. Bing Crosby’s was the voice that first made the song popular on the radio. Of course, the atmosphere at the time, back in 1941, was also instrumental in its success. It makes one happy, hopeful, and wistful for the simpler things in life. This was just when the Second World War was ending and soldiers were returning home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result, the song itself has become a symbol of Christmas cheer. While it is secular in its content, it does talk about many relatable things everyone traditionally feels about Christmas. For instance, it mentioned the glistening tree top and sleigh bells, and, of course, snow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. The Ones Who Tuned In&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1549.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;When it was Christmas time in 1941, many American soldiers were very far away from home. Of course, they missed the traditional festivities that they remembered back home. During this time, this song became something almost sacred to them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“White Christmas” would come on the radio through Kraft Music Hall. American who heard the original version for the first time was most probably thinking about the attack on Pearl Harbor. This occurred just a little more than a couple of weeks before the release of this song.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. The Demand for “White Christmas”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1551.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bing Crosby, the original voice behind the song, soon began going on overseas tours. He was a known singer in his own right, but “White Christmas” was somehow his most requested song. This was especially true when his audience was comprised of American soldiers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, Bing Crosby himself was never too eager to perform this particular song. In fact, he tried to cut it out of his act several times. However, the persistent request of his audience usually made him put it back in for their sake. Even then, he would think long and hard before starting to play and sing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. The Reason for the Hesitation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1553.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Bing Crosby’s hesitation was not out of a dislike for the song “White Christmas” itself. It was more of a preservation technique and a way to prevent soldiers from feeling too homesick. He didn’t want the troops feeling sad and missing home more than they absolutely had to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, it is understandable why so many soldiers would want to hear this song regularly. It reminded them of home, no matter how much it broke their heart to be far away from it. This is why they would usually not give up until Crosby performed “White Christmas”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Another Song&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1555.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;In a way, this discussion is reminiscent of another popular Christmas song “I’ll Be Home for Christmas”. This song was well beloved by soldiers and prisoners alike. However, the sadness of this song comes to light in the very last line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This lyric goes ‘I’ll be home for Christmas…if only in my dreams’. The heart-wrenching reality of those who could not be home with their family for the holidays is quite saddening. However, both this song and “White Christmas” are describing the very feeling of Christmas. Hence, they are both well-loved even if they do have some connections to tragedy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. The Story Goes On&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1557.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;However, when we talk about “White Christmas”, nostalgia isn’t the only thing that makes it sad. The real tragedy of this song lies with the talent that created it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It seems strange but the writer/composer of “White Christmas” was not a Christian. Irving Berlin had come to America from Russia, and was Jewish. Perhaps this accounts for the non-religious factor within the song. Of course, the secularism in the work only serves to make it more appealing to modern Americans.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;6. The Tragedy at Christmas&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1559.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;But we digress. Berlin actually penned the song “White Christmas” not as a nostalgic yearning for the simple joys of this holiday. For him, Christmas was a day of mourning more than anything else. This was the day his son died after only three weeks of being alive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every Christmas Day since 1928, Berlin and Ellin, his wife, visited their son’s grave. They would put a wreath on the grave, and that was their Christmas tradition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. The Contrast&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1561.jpeg&quot;/&gt;twitter &lt;p&gt;With all the excitement about Christmas in America, one can imagine how stark the contrast must have been. Here was a grieving couple who had lost their child at a terribly young age. On the other hand, they were surrounded by people who were ecstatically happy about the holidays and Christmas traditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One can only imagine the sorrow that must have enveloped Berlin when penning this song. The lyrics are simple and there are little more than fifty words. The song is perhaps all the more heartfelt because of his loss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. The Great Hit&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1563.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikimedia &lt;p&gt;When it came to “White Christmas”, the success of Berlin’s work was a surprise to many. Along with the low number of words, it also had only sixty-seven notes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Berlin was a talented composer, and his other works were much more mature and deep. Still, “White Christmas” was the work that propelled his fame to new heights. It was used in the movie Holiday Inn as part of a musical. “White Christmas” even managed to bag an Academy Award.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. The Covers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1565.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikimedia &lt;p&gt;As is the case with almost every popular classic song, “White Christmas” was covered by several artists and musicians. These include Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Dean Martin, Otis Redding, and even Elvis Presley. More recently, Taylor Swift has also released her version of this Christmas classic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Elvis Presley was one of the most iconic singers to date, Berlin did not like his cover of “White Christmas”. This was understandable, since the composer was not a fan of the rock ‘n roll music genre in general. Since this was the field in which Presley was king, there was bound to be a clash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Irving Berlin was actually so opposed to Presley’s cover that he campaigned to have it banned from every radio station. This goes to show us just how passionate he was about his work even if he didn’t consider it his best one. However, his campaign was largely unsuccessful. That year, Elvis’ Christmas Album topped the Billboard charts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Another Piece of Trivia&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1566.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikimedia &lt;p&gt;Another interesting fact about the song “White Christmas” is that we don’t really have the original version anymore. The song was such a huge hit that Bing Crosby had to record it again in 1942 in order to make it better for radio and general distribution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, there is another reason for this repeat recording. Apparently, the 1941 version had been taped over or misplaced. As a result, Crosby had to re-record the tune all over again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s more, even this 1942 recording also wore out due to its immense popularity. Ah, the great problems of the twentieth century! With the recording software we have today, this would never have happened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Crosby was good enough to record yet another version in 1947. This, finally, is the version of the song that is still extremely popular today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. The Hint in the Tune&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1567.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikimedia &lt;p&gt;If one listens closely to “White Christmas”, the tragedy surrounding Berlin is not such a surprise. This is because the tune of the song is not a happy, bouncy one. The latter is usually the case with the truly joyful Christmas songs. However, Christmas does bring out the melancholy in some as well as excitement in others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While “White Christmas” is no “Jingle Bells”, it does pluck at the hearts of those who aren’t feeling too upbeat at Christmas. The season may get them down for one reason or another. Perhaps this is why the masses still make this song so very popular year after year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not everyone has to feel hyper and full of good cheer on Christmas. People experience losses, or could be away from their loved ones at that time. Seeing everyone rushing around with their own families and in a bubble of happiness may make things worse. This song may hence help remind many that they are not alone in their sadness.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;The little details of “White Christmas” are quite different now that we know the story behind it. One can still enjoy it as a lovely Christmas song. However, it is more important; we feel, that we learn as much as we can about what we are listening to. If we can feel some human empathy along with enjoying the music, the world would be a better and kinder place.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"The Dark and Tragic Tale Behind America's Most Popular Christmas Song","description":"Every song has a story behind it, but the story behind this popular song may move you to tears."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/a/e930df79d86e2153b992277b9e93600a_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/a/f29ed14f0cfd6576dbc4d0727b2a89ca_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"It Is Now Illegal to Declaw a Cat in Denver"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/a/e1f3ef40edb59929d935e5e87ea2188a_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Hidden Insecurities That Your Man Have"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
