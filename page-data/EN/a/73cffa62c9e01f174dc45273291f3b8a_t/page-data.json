Add a little obsession, a dose of jealousy, pint of drama, a big amount of cuteness and a huge pile of complications. It’s the little things that could make them happy or bring her mood down to zero. No one’s perfectly been ever able to understand a girl, not even their own wives or daughters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are 10 things girls are guilty of doing. And they don’t care if you judge them for it. It is not necessary that every girl will relate to these 10 points, but most do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1891.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;h2&gt;Put On Makeup Just For a Picture&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1892.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Behind every flawless picture that you see on Instagram is a 2 hour long preparation. You have to earn those double taps. And every girl knows that. Girls spend hours in front of a mirror going through the whole procedure from primer to setting spray so that they look perfect in front of the camera. It’s a must to show off those cheekbone with just a little help of the bronzer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just to get a single picture with that highlighter poppin’ girls go through the whole routine. Her eyebrows need to be on fleek or else the world cannot see her. There a numerous tutorials on YouTube guiding girls how to wear makeup for camera. These tutorials even give a list of products used. There are tutorials on the Internet showing how to get the perfect pout or duckface or any weird kind of pose that could get you more likes than other girls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To a girl, her Instagram posts are a serious deal. She’ll take a hundred pictures and only one will make the cut and get honored to be posted on her Instagram feed. Or, if hours of watching tutorials and her makeup skills paid off another one will make an appearance on social media with the mandatory caption throwback Thursday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Whaling for Compliments&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1893.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Girls need to hear that they’re beautiful. Every now and then we feel low and insecurities creep in. Sitting in sweatpants with their hair tied in a bun, sitting on top of their head and face swollen from all those midnight snacks girls need to make sure that they’re still perfect. In days like these a little compliment can make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the perfect moment to post that throwback picture from when your skin was glowing, eyebrows on fleek and your hair looked flawless. All you need to do is post a picture and your loyal army of followers will bombard you with complements in the comment section. A girl’s mood shoots up from 0 to 100 when her crush likes her picture. And breaks the bar if he comments. One good picture that’s all that’s required. Insecurities, what?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another technique that works every time is complaining. There’s no need to post any picture in this case. Girls complain to their best friends just to hear “Gurl, are you kidding me? You’re not fat you look perfect.” And that helps with the self-esteem issues. Thank God for friends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Have Their Phones Glued To Their Hands&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1894.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Everyone is guilty of this one not just girls, to be fair. Phones can cause drifts between relations and friends. But, what can a girl do if her phone’s loaded with unanswered texts messages and social media notifications? Then there’s Snapchat. If her Snap story didn’t see it did it even happen? Her Snapchat friends should know that she spent her weekend in her bed drinking coffee, watching Netflix and avoiding responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Compare Themselves to Others&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1895.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Yes she will compare herself to the girl who borrowed assignment from you. She will compare herself to that girl whose photo you just liked on Facebook. No matter how much you tell her that she’s better than other girl in the world she’ll ignore it and feel insecure about herself in presence of another girl. It obviously hurts the people who love her, but she can’t help it it’s in her nature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Be Indecisive, All the Time&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1896.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Never make the mistake of asking a girl where she wants to eat. I repeat, never. Girls are notorious to never be able to decide where she wants to eat. And it’s not until one of you lose your mind will that decision be made.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Why do you think they take forever in the mall? Girls cannot decide which dress to buy. Because it’s not just the choice of black or pink dress. It’s ‘do I want to look like a boss or Barbie? Do I have matching shoes? Lipstick? Jewelry? Which bag am I going to wear with it? Should I get a new bag?’ Her decisions are based on so many questions that it takes forever to take one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Talk About Girl Issues Even If You Don’t Relate&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1897.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;When it’s that time of the month, girls have so much to go through. PMS-ing Cramps and mood swings are the worst. There’s nothing she can do about it but complain. It’s not in her authority to control her mood or language. So, all you can do is bear with her. Would be better if you get her some flowers or chocolates. That won’t help with the pain but will at least make her happier that you are there by her side.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stock Up On Products&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1898.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Girl’s obsession with things is real. The reason makeup industries are so successful because girls love to buy it even when they don’t need to. She has to have the Kylie Cosmetics Holiday Edition lip kits even if her dressing table has a separate drawer just for lip products. Even if a one blush is missing from her collection of over a hundred blushes she’ll throw a tantrum and get 2 new. Similarly, girls need to have a collection of shoes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doesn’t matter if she’ll ever wear those she has to buy them only because she ~loves~ shoes. These shoe collections could be enough to start a shop of their own. And, yet still you’ll always find her in her Adidas Superstars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hanging Out In Groups&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1899.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Whether it’s the mall or the bathroom, girls go in groups. Reason? They’re planning to take over the world with Beyoncé as their leader. It’s time to paint it all pink.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Girls always have to have their girlfriends by their side. To give them shopping advice, or relationship advice. Or to tell them that they look perfect while they fix each other’s lipsticks in the washroom. The best selfies are the ones taken in the washroom mirror, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They will all go to the bathroom together to bitch about the new girl he’s hanging out with and how awful her dress is. This is why girls’ phones are always buzzing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s the group chat emergencies what does your ‘hey :)’ text mean and how should it be replied with. Every squad member has to approve a picture before it’s posted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Talking Down About Themselves&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1900.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Ever noticed how girls are always complaining about how they look. Even Angelina Jolie might do that at times, I bet. To others, she probably looks perfect. Other girls are probably envying her legs or silky hair. Yet still girls’ insecurities always linger around making her feel worthless and ugly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have a friend with low self-esteem make sure you’re by her side to ensure her that she’s beautiful the way she is. Whether dark or fair, curvy or skinny every girl is perfect and deserves to enjoy life without her mind constantly be conscious about how she looks. Everyone has some qualities that make them different and unique than others. Remind her of those qualities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pretend They’re Fine Even If They’re not&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1901.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Most of the time girls don’t want to broadcast their problems to the whole world. This is why it’s easier to say “I’m fine” rather than explain the mess that’s been bothering them. Girls are really sensitive and you’ll never know what hurt them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It could be something you said, something they remembered out of the blue, something that opened an old wound, someone’s presence. This list could go on and on. Rather than explaining she’s going to reply with her ultimate defense ‘I’m fine”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Save a lot of time and energy. Because, she knows if she opens up it could take forever and she might even end up crying. Her close friends always knows that behind this fake façade is her hurting heart and that’s another great things about girls. They will always support each other and will always be there for them, offering their shoulder and wiping off her friend’s tears.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;People think they understand girls. To them all girls care about is attention, makeup and shoes. But, in reality a girl’s mind is like a twisted maze with no escape. And the funniest part is that even she fails to understand the mess in her own head.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Secret Gross Things That All Girls Do But Don't Talk About","description":"Girls are really interesting creation.
