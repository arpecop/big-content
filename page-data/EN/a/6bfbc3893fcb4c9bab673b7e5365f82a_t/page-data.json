Despite the fact that this 40 something man is pushing his luck being with a college-aged girl in our minds, society seems to be perhaps moving much faster than we deemed plausible. Compound that with the fact there seems to be some grade-A Public Display of Affection going on, it appears that things may have genuinely gone awry. Whether you choose to laugh, cry, admire or cringe for humanity, there will always be distinct emotions to outline our cause.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It gets spicier. Considering how the women are a consenting adult of legal age, judging or passing verdicts does seem unfair on our part. After all, it is 2017 (barely now). And since when are there age thresholds to make relationships questionable. Maybe humanity is coming of age after all (MAYBE!). We sneer and backstab all the young-gunning uncles in our family with the women pile driving them into the ground, but who’s to say what we would’ve done under the circumstances. With a wife half his age, we doubt he’d even care about the weeping you all do behind his back. Nobody can see beyond those slim shoulders now, can they…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes we blame gold-digging tendencies and daddy issues to boot with for the women that dig older men (wayy older). But are the men the real roots of the problem here? Is it even a problem? And most importantly, why do men even waver that way, to begin with?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What many people oversee, however, is that men date women a fraction of their age for a good reason. Despite there being substantial differences between each person in age and personality alike, we still happen to find common ground over time and thus learn to agree as people. Even if that means watching gramps stroll around with that young, hot ‘un. She can mean lesser responsibility, strength in character, attention, anonymity, acceptance and all that an aging man ever craves out of his relationship (or lusts for anyways). He may just be dating her role rather than her for all it is worth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;19. Wonder-esque stamina&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-169.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;According to a survey, 79 percent of aged men claim that a regular roll in the hay is vital to them in the run of things. Directly speaking, in a man’s eyes, a younger woman equals a more youthful body. This exists not just aesthetically, but also psychologically as younger people tend to have fewer aches, pains, digestion issues, and all of the arsenal of small ailments that come upon us every year we get older, which bear our partner down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is much less of a grind on him — considering he probably has a full plate with these things as well. It is much easier to sustain the relationship when just one person in the pair is falling apart. Younger women can take longer hikes, have much more time to rumble in the bedroom and can challenge him in most aspects — which may not be the case with women that share his age. The men are still interested in intimacy and new things mentally, which in turn puts their stamina and drive above women the same age as them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;18. Mid-life crisis stricken&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-170.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;When older men go out with younger women, often it’s not for a serious relationship and is just a side fling. Most commonly, men will do the obvious — a toupee or hair plugs for the hair; Botox to decrease wrinkles and increase appeal; even trade in their SUV for a convertible to become all hip and trendy again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He might decide to visit a dance club on Friday nights, even though his dance moves aren’t quite up to today’s standards and you can’t teach an old dog new tricks (dab, daddy-o). He may even try out those hot yoga classes in the hope of meeting a young and hot, plaything in her yoga pants before the class is even remotely over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;17. Perky to the max&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-171.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Mature women who tend to be the same age as their men are more settled in their ways. They have a specific way that they like to arrange their kitchen. They have their coffee at a specific time in the morning each day. Little does the male cradle robber realize he’s going out with someone with a loose and carefree life who won’t possibly take care of him the way a more mature woman can, ever. But perkiness is perkiness, we guess.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;16. Zero strings attached&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-172.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Lets agree to agree. Younger women primarily appeal to older men because they are a novelty commodity in their minds. Mostly, this notion wears off when they find out that the same things that initially attracted them to their girlfriend are in fact the exact same things that will probably end the relationship at the dusk of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sure, there are examples of some relationships that are genuine in intimacy, and involve two people who truly can love each other despite a visibly large age difference. But the complete lack of responsibility that a newer, younger woman brings as luggage, doubled with the fact that she has a whole life ahead of her equates that she will bounce back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. Not a peep left or right&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-173.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Whenever an older man dates a younger woman, quite often, she will be having a polar opposite lifestyle to his. The men of the girls her own age are wearing cheap and knockoff tee shirts donning band logos and wearing weathered and ripped jeans while being involved neck deep in memes. It’s a vastly different circle of friends that she has and most likely different places that they hang out in so no links back to the older man’s life. So they’re safe in the essence that no one ever gets to know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. Life is flex and bend for them&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-174.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shuttestock &lt;p&gt;Maybe the fact that they are not stubbornly set in their ways quite yet, or are genuinely established in their careers, or are busily invested in raising children that take all of the attention away from the leading man in their life, younger women tend to be more emotionally available. Moreover, they also tend to be more pliable and flexible when it comes to molding their personality to fit the needs of their man.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Ease is order of the day&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-175.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, which one of us doesn’t want to reap all the benefits without putting in all the hard work? Older men tend to be in a position of power in the relationship, often calling all the shots and making all the decisions. This leads them to be able to delegate al the work rather than make any actual efforts themselves. Moreover, long-term relationships require emotional attachment and genuine effort. Chances are, that a relationship as superficial as this one would require minimum effort on account of being so temporary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Work easy- play hard&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-176.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shuttestock &lt;p&gt;An older man is more to be more settled than a younger man, making him a better sugar daddy candidate. He is more likely to have a mortgage, a spouse, an ex-spouse, and children than younger men. This leads younger females to believe that older men are more stable and secure, owing to the responsibility they have on their shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;11. Boss Complexes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-177.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Because of his significantly greater life experience, our very own Mr. Cradle Robber might think that he is in charge of both the younger female and his relationship with her. This holds true to the degree that younger women do tend to be more pliable, often idolizing their older boyfriends. They tend to listen to them more often and object lesser, letting them call the shots, something that a mature and wise woman would never let them do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Automated ego feeding&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-178.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;To have a gorgeous, younger woman by your side when you are out in public, or at a function with your peers, is nothing short of a great ego boost for men. Men often find themselves unknowingly stroking their egos in an attempt to make themselves feel superior to the men around them. To a mature woman, such immature antics would be distasteful and degrading while younger women would let it slide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. His want matches her needs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-179.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;When men are younger, they often have trouble landing dates. Sometimes they aren’t well settled enough, and sometimes they are not rich enough to be considered desirable by society’s standards. So when they get older and are more established and stable, they automatically become more desirable in the eyes of the opposite gender, making them eligible for women they previously had no chance with. The problem is, because they never got to experiment in their younger years, the teenager inside them still wants younger women. Dating a younger woman becomes an obsession that has been denied for far too long. This denial makes them lash out even harder, and before you know it, they are what can only be certified as a serial cradle robber, trading in their girlfriends for even younger versions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. No rejection on the cards&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-180.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;One of the hardest parts of initiating a new relationship is when a man has to overcome the unbearable fear of rejection. Younger women think that older men are more experiences, thus, more confident. This perception makes it harder for them to turn them down, making the rejection levels drop significantly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Adventurous all day, erryday&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-181.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;In bed and in out of it, it is a fact that younger people are more adventurous than older people. The younger you are, the easier you find it to embrace your sexuality, instead of trying to shy away from it. Growing up often leads to people being more inhibited, while on the other hand, younger people are more spontaneous. So when someone older chooses to interact closely with someone younger than they are, they feel inundated with spontaneity as well. Dating a younger woman is like going on an adventure filled fun spree. Once a man gets a taste of that feeling, it can be hard to let it slip through his fingers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. New women are ecstacy to their mind&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-182.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;When the relationship is new, everything seems exciting and thus, a cause for celebration. While sparks tend to die out after a while, the feeling remains persistent if the woman in question is younger than they are. Younger people, by nature, are filled to the brink with energy and enthusiasm. This vitality tends to rub off on everyone they surround themselves with. The thrill and excitement a younger woman brings into your life are beyond comparison to anything else that life may have to offer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. New taste for the palette&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-183.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Being with someone who is significantly younger than you is nothing short of a trip to a candy shop. If your significant other is way younger than you are, the chances are that she watches different movies and enjoys different music and overall lives a life different than what yours is like. On account of the stark difference between the lives of them both, she could end up opening his eyes to newer things that he might not have been able to discover on his own. Get it on, daddy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. A reminder of better times&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-184.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Who’s to blame older men when they feel nostalgic about times that involved them with flowing locks of dense hair and youthful, taut bodies? The thing with younger women is that they are a stark reminder to these men of their youth and that is a commodity they are prepared to pay any price for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Fertility births flings&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-185.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;IOpen mindedness ins her Standard Operating Protocoln this day and age, offspring means continuance and continuance is man-pride. Sound primal? It is. But that is how it is in general with men. They can realize very late in life that they want a heir to their name and fortune and so seek offspring that their age fellow women may not be able to sustain both physically and fertility wise. So the men begin to seek newer avenues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Open mindedness if her modus operandi&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-186.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;At some point in life, men begin to have a range of drastically outrageous ideas (I’M GONNA BUILD A BOAT) that their age fellow wives may not deem the best. This can seem stemming to these ageing men and they seek more open minded support in the form of younger women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Younger she makes a healthier he&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-187.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock     &lt;p&gt;Men are naturally competitive and having competitive bodies in the form of youth and health drive them to self betterment, through which they push themselves to be healthier. Having such driven physical activity generates endorphins in your body which lead to a feel good chemical lifting your spirits. This qualifies as a motivating biological aspect for ageing men.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"19 Reasons Why Men Go for Younger Women","description":"Despite the fact that this 40 something man is pushing his luck being with a college-aged girl in our minds, society seems to be perhaps moving much faster than we deemed plausible."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/a/6bfbc3893fcb4c9bab673b7e5365f82a_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/a/6c0886db258048ace8bbc315068b745a_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"19 Genius Ways to Solve Everyday Problems"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/a/61cca6e7b8ba92457935bce0c402c8ea_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"How to Stay Together When You're Different From Each Other"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
