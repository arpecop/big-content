Well, it might be true looking at the fact that every barber is an expert at sharp tools but there are certain things we do everyday which can increases the chance for us to die unexpectedly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Did you know that leaving a toothache untreated can end you up in brain damage? Or talking on the phone while it’s plugged in can end you up with no ear? Well this sounds scary, you might want to read on to find more facts we have compiled to help you be safe in the daily routine. Ready? Let’s get right into the post.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;19.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1057.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;This is strange and nearly impossible to avoid as there are screens everywhere around us; phones, laptops, televisions and even cars. So what if we stare long enough on the screens around us every day? According to researches, if you stare long enough at the screen everyday for more than 4 hours, it can increase the chances for you to suffer from stroke for more than 110%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well it is very hard for some people to avoid the screens as work nowadays have less involvement of paper work and it requires for us to work for up to 8 hours in front of the screen but is there any way we can cut down the dangers? Yes! There are specially designed UV glasses that you can wear at work which will protect you from unwanted rays from the screens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;18.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1058.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;This can be considered common for everyone around to ignore the occasional toothaches; the amount of pain it gives us can be an indicator for us to get the idea that going to the dentist for a regular checkup is essential and there might be something more serious than just a nerve getting disturbed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A toothache can indicate problems inside the tooth and can grow into serious infections or diseases if untreated on time. These infections usually affect our brain because of close connections to it through mouth. To avoid such circumstances, schedule a visit to the dentist once in 3 months for them to check if everything’s fine at the back of your teeth and well, it also gives you cleaner teeth so go for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;17.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1059.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;The working schedules nowadays are demanding us to sit for hours especially when all the work includes sitting in front of a screen mostly; so sometimes we don’t realize the importance of taking breaks in between which can be beneficial for our back and overall health. Did you know that sitting for prolonged hours can actually lead to heart attack?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well this might sound strange but here’s what happens. When you sit too much without taking breaks, you grow blood clots in your legs which can later suspend in your blood flow and eventually blocking your heart; leading to an unexpectedly early heart attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;16.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1060.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;How many times have we avoided consulting a doctor for the headache we get occasionally? Imagine coming back from work on evening and experiencing this weird frequenting pain in your right wrist, well you might think of it as a sprain or it was too cold today but it could another thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note that most of the diseases are not diagnosed with clearly apparent symptoms but through small one like headaches, upset stomach or coloration in the skin which we ignore massively to give self-medication a good attention. Diseases like cancer reach their last stages due to this one mistake of not consulting the doctor on minor symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1061.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Yeah I know that you have to watch that episode at midnight but why schedule it so late when you can stretch out time anytime in the day or evening? Well, I’m not being a dad here but listen, it’s quite serious. Sleep deprivation is a real issue around our ambiance and it develops by not focusing on sleeping a sustainable amount at night; which means a distorted sleep pattern and feeling fatigued almost every time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The effects are worse than alcohol and can lead to chronic issues like psychological illnesses and even weight issues, which can be hard to tackle with all the low energies of less sleep every night. Try to schedule your sleeping pattern and plan everything by evening so you don’t compromise your health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1062.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Okay I get it, you must be an entrepreneur with all the orders coming through, a contractor to deal with the customers or… No? You aren’t? Alright my bad. Well that’s a surprise because it gets me wondering why you have to stick to your phone so much that it explodes on your face. Yes that happens when you have low charge on your phone and you really have to talk to somebody due to boredom but take note, if your charger is faulty at some point, it can make your phone explode on your ear leading to severe burns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Samsung users might want to be more careful here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1063.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Nearly 1.3 Million people die each year and around 50 Million people are injured due to road accidents each year. The major cause of these accidents is one small mistake of not following safety rules correctly. Wearing seatbelts in the car and helmets on bike is a very simple task but ignoring it can definitely make you one of those 1.3 million people because of an unexpected accident on the highway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1064.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Ever wondered what could possibly happen if you decided to restrict that massive, window-shattering sneeze? Well if you plan to do that any sooner, just know that it could be the last time you’d hear something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Restricting a sneeze can cause a few things like damaging your ear drum, rupturing an artery or puncturing your diaphragm but if you’re lucky, you can get away without any harm, too. So next time you decide to pinch your nose and block your mouth while sneezing, it could even pop your eyes out so save it.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;11.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1065.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Who would be stupid enough to try lighting a cigarette at Gas station? There have been numerous of fire cases caused by smoking. The reason behind it is the volatile nature of petrol which turns into fumes to move in the air and sticks to everything around it, increasing the chances of the objects catching quick fire. Well what’s worse here is the fact that water isn’t that effective on such fires which can make you lose your car or most possibly the skin you wear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1066.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Heaters can be dangerous if misused. If you have a gas heater, then it is important for you to be in the same room while it’s burning and turn it off before you sleep. The reason behind such precautions is Carbon Monoxide which is released from burning natural gas and if it gets filled in a closed room, it can cause suffocation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1067.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Its common sense to realize that if you see a fire caused by electric wires or appliances, water will get you connected to it causing death. So if you experience an electric fire at home, then it is recommended to shut down the power first in order for the electricity to stop flowing. Once that is done, you can use sand to extinguish the fire if you can’t reach an extinguisher.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1068.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;If you have clogged up wires under the carpet or anywhere in the house, you might want to unclog and keep every wire separate. This is because if by any chance an exposed wire gets in contact with conductors, then it can start a fire which can engulf your house in flames.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1069.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;If you notice that the fan at your place is hanging loose with it screws screaming to get back in place, then call your electrician or grab a screw driver to fix it yourself. The fan, if not fixed can fall on anyone creating more problems for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1070.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;If you prefer leaving the food cooking on stove and watching tv in the lounge in hope for it to not burn, then you might get yourself in trouble. The reason behind not paying attention to the stove is because of indulging in other activities like watching TV or reading a book which can distract you completely from the thought that there is something burning. This kind of mistake can cause house fires and can potentially engulf you with the house.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1071.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;It is very irresponsible more the people to not wait for a couple of seconds to cross the road in which they choose to reply to a text or two, thinking of traffic to be scarce. But it can be a life threatening mistake because vigilance is must in such circumstances and a minor distraction can end you up in hospital or worse, grave.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1072.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;This is commonly acknowledged in many parts of your country where a city is not safe at night for treading or small hassles like taking money from the ATM. If you happen to reside in one of the areas then do not even think of going out there thinking everything would be fine because some lunatic robber might rob or murder you for a couple of bucks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1073.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Not keeping a driver’s license and considering it “okay” can become a reason behind your lifelong regret because if you accidently happen to hit somebody with your car or bike, then the state will charge you with murder and you can end up in jail till you get old or die.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1074.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;The safety lines on the subway train stations are there for keeping you safe from fast moving trains. Standing close to the line is dangerous because the fast moving train has an effect on the air around it which strangely pulls you towards it and it wouldn’t take 2 minutes for you to get chopped under the train if this happens; so keep a good distance from the railway track and stop anyone getting close to it for good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1075.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Drinking heavily and driving is a common practice but if drinker a little and driving gets you killed, then? Alcohol is called poison for a reason; first it kills you slowly by hollowing you internally and secondly, it increases the chances for you to die because of external forces. If you think you will drink a little and drive a couple of miles, then know that alcohol can sometimes affect your body in a sedative way and you can most probably sleep in the middle of the road.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Safety rules don’t deserve to be ignored but spread generously from one community to another. If you found this post to be helpful and made you learn new things about general safety, then make sure to share it with your friends and family; your share can save someone’s life one day. Peace out!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"19 Things We Do Everyday Despite Knowing How Dangerous They Are","description":"Well this sounds scary, you might want to read on to find more facts we have compiled to help you be safe in the daily routine."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/a/8d024f97c2cf3dc38481def0bd66601a_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/a/960a42424f13ef23ab285c0c630e291a_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"12 best iPhone tips & tricks, in iOS 11.2 and earlier"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/a/89d1b21472c87d875973e6eadaaafaba_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"30 Reasons Why I Cheated on My Wife"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
