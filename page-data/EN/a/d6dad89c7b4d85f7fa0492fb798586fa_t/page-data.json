The strength of this bond is perfectly shown by the story of Ada Keating and her son, Tom. The 98 year old mother joined her eldest son, 80, in Moss View Care Home in Liverpool in order to take care of him. The two get along extremely well and it just comes to show that you are never too old to mother your child.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Family Situation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-684.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Liverpool Echo &lt;p&gt;Ada and her husband, Harry, had four children. One child, unfortunately, passed away at the tender age of 13, but the remaining three siblings, including Tom, remain alive. Tom has never married and has always lived with Ada who worked as an auxiliary nurse. Before his retirement, Tom worked as a painter and decorator at HE Simm Building Services. In 2016, he became a resident of Moss View Care Home because he required help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Mother Wants To Help&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-685.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Liverpool Echo &lt;p&gt;Just over a year after Tom moved into the care home, Ada decided to move as well in order to help her eldest son as best she could. The two are inseparable and love spending quality time together. Their favourite hobbies include playing games and watching Emmerdale. About her relationship with Tom, Ada stated, “I say goodnight to Tom in his room every night and I’ll go and say good morning to him. When I go out to the hairdressers he’ll look for me to see when I’m coming back. When I get back he’ll come to me with his arms outstretched and give me a big hug.”&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;I am sure the two must love each other dearly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What does Tom think of the Situation?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-686.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Liverpool Echo &lt;p&gt;Tom is very happy with the new turn of events. He has lived with Ada all his life and loves spending time with her. About the situation, Tom said, “They’re very good here and I’m happy to see my mum more now she lives here. She’s very good at looking after me. Sometimes she’ll say ‘Behave yourself!’” It is great to know that he is in a good place and that even at his age, he does not respond negatively to the guidance of his mother.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Views of those at the Care Home&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The manager at the care home remarked how it is extremely rare to have to take care of both a mother and a son at the same time. He commented on the strong bond they both shared and how it is very touching to see the two interact. The care home is delighted to be able to accommodate both mother and son and is committed to trying to make their remaining time together as delightful as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Social Media Response&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-687.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Facebook &lt;p&gt;When the story was posted on the Internet, people from all walks of life were able to relate with the story. The users were in awe at the bond between Tom and Ada and posted some of their views on Facebook. The responses, shown above are beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;During our old age, it is often the loneliness that really causes us to suffer. We are no longer as independent as we would wish and we cannot as actively pursue our own relationships. It is extremely refreshing to see that even in her late 90s, a mother has the energy when it comes to taking care of her son. I am sure the two are enjoying their time together and provide excellent company for one another. A mother’s love will never cease and she will do everything in her power to ensure that the child lives the best possible life he can.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Mom, 98, Moves Into Care Home to Look After Her 80-Year-Old Son Because &quot;You Never Stop Being a Mum&quot;","description":"It isn’t often that you come across a story of a mother taking care of her son at an old person’s home.
