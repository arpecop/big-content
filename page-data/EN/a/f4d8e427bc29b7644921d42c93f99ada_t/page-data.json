He gave Kate McClure twenty dollars so she could fill her car with gas, even though that was the last 20 dollars that the homeless man had on him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kate McClure has decided to return the favor and started a GoFundMe campaign to provide Johnny with a better life and has raised more than 300,000 dollars for him.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; üçÅPositivity Post-ever so often we feature an individual who had performed a heroic or compassionate deed. . A New Jersey woman who was helped by a homeless man when she ran out of gas in Philadelphia is raising money to help him. Kate McClure was heading to Philadelphia to visit a friend last month when she ran out of gas on Interstate 95. Kate pulled over and began to worry until a homeless man approached her. . The man, a Marine Corps veteran named Johnny Bobbit Jr., told her it wasn‚Äôt safe and told her to get back into her car and lock the doors. A few minutes later, Kate said Johnny returned with a red gas can, having used his last $20 to buy fuel for her car. . Kate promised she would return to pay him, and she has periodically returned with gifts, including $20 for the gas, along with clothing and food. Kate said that she gave Johnny a box of cereal bars, and the first thing he asked was if she wanted one. . Kate and her boyfriend, Mark D‚ÄôAmico, have since created a¬†GoFundMe¬†page with the goal of getting Johnny an apartment and help with transportation and a job. Johnny, 34, is a veteran of the US Marine Corps, and he was a firefighter/paramedic. (The 2nd &amp;amp; 3rd photos show Johnny before he became homeless). Kate said his story shows that any of us could fall upon hard times. The GoFundMe has since raised over $100,000. We wish Johnny the best‚Ä¶ üçÅ #johnnybobbittjr #kindness #thankfulthursday #positivity #positivevibes #katemcclure #thanksgiving2017 #instamemorials #homelessveterans #bethechange&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  üïäMemorial Tributesüïä (@instamemorials) on Nov 23, 2017 at 10:16am PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Johnny Bobbitt, a homeless man in the state of Pennsylvania has showed us all that we can still think for others before ourselves.

She ran out of cash to pay for gas. The twenty seven year old woman then received help from the most unexpected of sources a homeless man who was himself destitute decided to help her without regards to the dire straits he in himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though she could not repay the man then and there she made sure not to forget his kindness and came to visit him several times each time bearing gifts such as clothes including warm socks, a jacket and a hat in addition to food and last but not least she gave Johnny cash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1461.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Kate eventually came to find out that Johnny had not always been like this and like so many others struggling in a tough economy he too had fallen on hard times. The 34 year old Johnny had seen better days and previously served as paramedic, a fire fighter and perhaps the most amazing thing of all was the fact that Johnny had bravely served his nation and was a veteran of the United States Marine Corps one of the nation‚Äôs premier fighting forces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The campaign has far surpassed her initial hopes and expectations for it. She was aiming for about ten thousand dollars and however the American people have shown once again that we stand by those less fortunate than ourselves. In the end more than ten thousand donors came together to raise more than 370,000 dollars to help a hero in need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kate says she wants to use the money so that Johnny can find a place to live, get a car of his own and to get his life in order. Kate shared details with the public that she and her boyfriend had put Johnny up in a hotel so that he could spend a weekend in comfort and that they were also busy looking for permanent accommodation for Johnny. No man, woman or child should have to be homeless in this day and age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fact that Johnny has done so much for his country and has served in the United States Marine Corps and still has to live on the streets also raises some serious moral questions on America‚Äôs social safety nets and how we treat the brave men and women risking life and limb for this country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1462.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;According to twenty seven year old Kate McClure in the GoFundMe advertisement she says that she wanted to do as much as she could help the 34 year old Samaritan. She further went on to say that she thought that all the man really needed was a little help from society at large and that he would be able to pull himself from the state of poverty and misery and he was in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This incident goes to show that despite the fact that the world and the people around us might al seem to be very selfish and self-centered kindness has not died and cannot be allowed to die.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;We all must fight to keep our inner humanity alive no matter what circumstances that we find ourselves in.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Woman Raises More Than $200k for Homeless Man After He Gave Her His Last $20 for Gas in Philadelphia","description":"Description: Johnny Bobbitt, a homeless man in the state of Pennsylvania has showed us all that we can still think for other before ourselves.
