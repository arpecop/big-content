We might believe that our favorite celebrities are beyond these struggles which plague us common peasants but that couldn’t be farther than the truth. Here are ten of our most favorite celebs, their actual dress sizes and the struggles they have had regarding body image issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Katy Perry who dazzles in a size 8&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2418.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via wikipedia &lt;p&gt;We love her vocals and we love her performing on stage. Katy Perry is one of those rare artists who doesn’t just have great vocals and sings on the stage; she is a downright gorgeous performer as well. She is also very well-known for her fabulous curves and over-the-top clothes. Seeing her on stage it is hard to believe that Katy is a size 8. She pulls everything she wears off with such ease and perfections. “I’m generally around 130 pounds, which is totally fine for me,” Katy says while talking to Elle magazine, “But when I was a kid, I was the same height and weighed more like 145. And I had enormous boobs that I didn’t know what to do with, so I wore minimizers, which were not cute … Little did I know…that these things would come in handy someday.” She has never made any effort to hide her curvy figure and her audiences love her for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-58.gif&quot;/&gt;via reactiongifs &lt;h2&gt;9. Mindy Kaling also a size 8&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2419.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Wikimedia commons &lt;p&gt;The sassy Mindy Kaling of The Mindy Project is incredibly self-confident and that is goals. She is not the ideal, stereotypical Hollywood hottie but knows how to rock her size 8 and shows the kind of confidence that only a size 0 does. In her book ‘Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?,’ Mindy addresses her size and writes, “For the record, I’m a size 8 (this week anyway). Many stylists hate that size because, I think, to them, I lack the self-discipline to be an aesthetic, or the sassy confidence to be a total fatty hedonist. They’re like ‘Pick a lane.&#39;” She’s fearless when it comes to her fashion choices, opting for bold cuts and loud colors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-59.gif&quot;/&gt;via reactiongifs &lt;h2&gt;8. Sofia Vergara curvy in a size 6&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2420.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Wikimedia commons &lt;p&gt;The drop-dead gorgeous Modern Family star Sofia Vergara slays people and their hearts in her to-die for curves at 5’7. She wears a size 6 and admits that although her ideal weight should be 130 but also says that, “My ass gets smaller, and my boobs get smaller,” she says. “I don’t mind when the boobs get smaller. I don’t like when the ass gets smaller. In Latin America, if you don’t have a big ass, you’re nothing.” She was always caught saying to NY Daily News that there are actresses who definitely look better than her in a dress but she looks better naked. Yaas queen! We hear you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-60.gif&quot;/&gt;tumblr via giphy &lt;h2&gt;7. Rachel Bloom has to buy her own dress at size 10&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2421.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Wikimedia commons &lt;p&gt;The actress and also creator of the comedy show &lt;em&gt;Crazy Ex-Girlfriend &lt;/em&gt;shot to fame with her brilliant acting. But she also made headlines when news about her Emmy dress surfaced. You’d think that designers would rush to dress a talented diva like Rachel but Bloom says that she found it impossible to find a dress in her size with many of the designers she checked in with. This is the sort of thing which goes to show everything that is wrong body image wise in the industry today. She ended up buying a pricy Gucci designer dress on her own and although we are glad things worked out for her, it is still a shame that a size 0 has more opportunities and options available than a size 10. She told Giuliana Rancic, “I’ve said in an interview before, ‘oh, sometimes it’s hard for places to lend me dresses because I’m not like, a size 0,’ but also I can afford it, so it’s okay.” That’s the spirit, Rachel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-61.gif&quot;/&gt;tumblr via giphy &lt;h2&gt;6. Kat Dennings has luscious curves at a size between 6 and 8&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2422.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Wikimedia commons &lt;p&gt;Hard working, hilarious, super talented and beautiful, inside and out, Kat Dennings wears her curves with perfection. She is petite in build and falls between sizes 6 and 8. She is also naturally quite endowed up top and that leads people to label her as fat. Well, news flash, she’s not! She looks exactly like the average American girl and if anyone finds that wrong then they need to set more realistic beauty standards. We love that Dennings is comfortable in her own skin and oozes confidence whenever she is on screen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-62.gif&quot;/&gt;via wifflegif &lt;h2&gt;5. Dascha Polanco slays our screens in her size 10&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2423.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Wikimedia commons &lt;p&gt;One of the incredible things that we love about &lt;em&gt;Orange is the new Black &lt;/em&gt;apart from the wonderful acting and strong storyline is how diverse the cast is. There are actors of all ages and body shapes representing different ethnicities and nationalities. Polanco herself wears a size 10, which again is completely normal in the real world but she is definitely on the larger side when it comes to Hollywood standards. “Fashion in my real life is more important to me than fashion in my acting life; it’s expressive, it’s creative, there’s so much to do with it,” says Polanco while talking to Vogue. However, designers won’t dress her because of her size. “I understand that it’s business, but still, it’s like, really? My industry friends, who are clear and honest with me say, “Girl, they don’t have your size, and you’re not at that level yet, so you have to either move that way or just build those relationships so that later in the future maybe it happens”.” It is just disheartening to see that fashion designers still have so much to make up for and catch up to in this particular regard.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-63.gif&quot;/&gt;tumble via giphy &lt;h2&gt;4. Melissa McCarthy never fails to stun in a size 16&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2424.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Wikimedia commons &lt;p&gt;Comedienne extraordinaire Melissa McCarthy is 5’3 and wears a size 16. She is hands down, one of the most talented and funniest women on TV at the moment. She is also crazy talented but her rise to stardom hasn’t been without struggles. During an interview with Refinery29 her weight came up as a question and she had the best clapback ever, “The thing is, if that is the most interesting thing about me, I need to go have a lavender farm in Minnesota and give this up. There has to be something more. There are so many more intriguing things about women than their butt or their this or their that. It can’t be the first question every time, or a question at all.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-64.gif&quot;/&gt;tumblr via giphy &lt;p&gt;She is unapologetic about who she is and accepts herself fully in every regard. McCarthy is a tremendous inspiration to girls and women all over the world who have body image issues. Using her influence in Hollywood Melissa has created her own clothing fashion line which caters to women of all sizes. It is people like her who restore our faith in the fact that looks will not get you as far as raw talent and hard work would. When you embrace the way you are and celebrate it then nothing can bring you down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Rebel Wilson in her curvy size 12&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2425.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Wikimedia commons &lt;p&gt;We love her witty sense of humor and the way she just lights up the screens whenever she’s on. Rebel Wilson does not let anyone else make light of her size 12. Instead, she does it herself. Although she jokes about her size from time to time, like McCarthy she has used the opportunities given to her by Hollywood’s platform to work on an exclusive line aimed to dress plus-sized women. Rebel Wilson does not fit the ideal Hollywood standard body wise but she is extremely proud of the way she looks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-administrator-downloads-31-10-2567-16-gif.gif&quot;/&gt;reddit via giphy &lt;p&gt;“…for me, it’s just about being comfortable in your own skin,” she says while talking to E News, “You never want to be like too unhealthy because that’s bad. But you just want to be comfortable with who you are, whatever your size.” Rock on Rebel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Demi Lovato rocks a size 8 after battling with eating disorders&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2406.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Wikimedia commons &lt;p&gt;This Disney super star shot to fame early on as just a teenager and later on made a name for herself as an amazing performer and solo vocalist. She hasn’t always had it easy and at the young age of 22 has struggled with more than people twice her age including everything from substance abuse to eating disorder. However, Demi Lovato has always been outspoken about the issues which have plagued her for a long time and has made an amazing recovery. Her journey is an inspiration to every young girl out there who struggles with similar issues in her own life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-administrator-downloads-31-10-2567-18-gif.gif&quot;/&gt;tumblr via giphy &lt;p&gt;After years of battling bulimia, self-harm, and addiction Demi eventually decided enough was enough and checked into rehab, where she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2011. “I had two choices: I could pretend it never happened, or I could tell people the truth,” she says. “I was tired of hiding and relieved to know what was wrong with me so I could finally do something to get better,” she explains while talking to Fitness Magazine. She is extremely proud of everything she has achieved so far and embraces her size 8 curvy figure with enviable confidence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Adele wears sizes between 14 and 16 and we are obsessed with her&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-administrator-downloads-31-10-2567-19-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Wikimedia commons     &lt;p&gt;Adele is a goddess who is the personification of grace and perfection and we couldn’t be any more obsessed with her than we already are. She stands tall at 5’9 and wears a size 14-16. Adele has been very open about her body image issues but insists that she does not let them rule her life. She believes that the world has only one of each kind of a person and that they are all supposed to look different, not the same. “I’ve seen people where it rules their lives, who want to be thinner or have bigger boobs, and how it wears them down,” she said in an interview with the Rolling Stone. “And I don’t want that in my life. I have insecurities, of course, but I don’t hang out with anyone who points them out to me.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-administrator-downloads-31-10-2567-20-gif.gif&quot;/&gt;tumblr via giphy   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Actual Celeb Dress Sizes That Will Make You Feel Better","description":"Celebs are humans too and not every one of them is a size 0."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/a/d0e61b5935cc0d1fc5079f5bc49178ea_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/a/d3110e60afc507b2d303294e56127b2a_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Transgender Man Becomes First Ever to Give Birth as Both Man and Woman"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/a/d0452c81387817f599736dfe793fbaaa_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Facts You Didn't Know About Men and Women"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
