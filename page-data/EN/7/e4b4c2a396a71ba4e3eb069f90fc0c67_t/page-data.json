However, many also affirm that we may be able to guess at our inner personalities from our hands. The fingers especially can give up deep clues about what kind of the person they’re attached to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just a few ways in which our pinky finger does this is by telling us how we show our emotions. It may even show how easily we travel, or adapt to change. While one may or may not believe in such practices, or think them wise, it is nevertheless an interesting topic. Read on below for an insight into what this little finger could be telling us:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Planet Association&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2195-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;When we start talking about fingers, we need to talk about the planets they’re associated with. In this case, the pinky finger is traditionally linked to the planet Mercury. Not only is Mercury one of the smallest planets in the Solar System, it’s affiliated with the Roman god Hermes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Association of fingers with planets represents the distinctive energies that each finger represents. Hermes is also the smallest of the Roman/Greek gods. He is also the god of finances, traveling, and communication. Hence, it follows that the pinky would be a signal about such aspects of human life as well as others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More specifically, the pinky is important in relation to its height as compared to the ring finger. We’re going to be looking at mostly this comparison and what it could say about an individual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Short and Sweet&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2195-2-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;If the tip of the little finger comes below the ring finger’s top joint, the pinky is said to be short. What does this mean?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically, if a person has this trait, their emotions may run amok. In other words, they may simply have too many emotions to deal with. This could cause problems when one wants to express themselves. When it comes to reacting towards other stimuli, such an individual may have special problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is even truer when these stimuli are somewhat romantic in nature. A short pinky person may hence not respond to such hints from another individual. Of course, they may realize and regret it later on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As one grows older, however, this person could start to realize hints more. They may be understood by few, but they are extremely resourceful and caring. In a nutshell, this is more the introvert type of personality. They hopefully learn to become a little more open to other people as time goes by. Empathy may be another way to describe a person with a short pinky and its characteristics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Begin the outpouring of words&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2195-3-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The best advice one can give to such a person is encouraging them to write. Writing out their emotions would help them organize their thoughts and describe their feelings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, they may tend to become more in control of their emotions and perhaps see them for what they are. For instance, if they are speechless at someone’s treatment, writing it could make them realize how angry they are. It would also help them work out just what it is that makes them angry. They would also look at the situation in a more objective manner, thus being better able to guide themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A sense of equality&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2195-4-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The pinky’s height could also be equal to that of the ring finger’s top joint. In this case, the corresponding personality is most likely a balanced one. The introvert and extrovert inside them are both equally active.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is quite an ideal situation to be in if such a thing exists in the world. Such persons may get irritated, angry or frustrated. However, they are also more likely to express themselves in a balanced manner. In other words, they are able to control themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main thing these individuals probably value is honesty. When something goes awry or if something is hidden, they can easily sense it. They may seethe and rage inside then, but would hopefully wait it out and solve issues at the proper time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Your Secret Weapon&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2195-5-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;When it comes to maintaining power and balance, laughter is a great weapon. Spirituality experts recommend checking chakras for such a person in order to make sure they’re balanced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hearts of the equal pinky person are warm, and this is maintained by laughter as well as other factors. Plus, laughter is also a way to radiate power and keep things under control. This is probably why people want to be seen laughing and having a good time with their friends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Aiming higher&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2195-6-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;If the pinky finger’s height is actually higher than the ring finger top joint, that again says something. Basically, it could point towards the psychological tendency to be an extrovert. This is not to say that such a person would thrive in other people’s company. However, they would be charismatic and have an attention-grabbing personality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those with such a physical trait, they may remember their childhood as being no different. They may have had no trouble finding other children to play with them. In fact, they would attract other people towards themselves and wouldn’t even have to go looking for a friend. This is quite the opposite of the short pinky personality discussed above, who is shy and withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Come back to Earth&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2195-7-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;In many senses, the dominant pinky person is very lucky. They’re not encased in a shell to be coaxed out of. Nor do they have to go in search of other people because other people search for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, such a person may have a lot of extra energy. Energy chakras could hence help them stay grounded and focus on others too. Since these individuals have a tendency to make things happen, they could be born leaders. However, they have to be careful not to get too lost in their ego.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically, such people tend to have dominant personalities. They may thus get lost in their own dreams, needs, and goals. However, in order to be successful and worthy, they should make an effort to appreciate those around them. They should take advice from those more experienced and learn that others may be wiser than they.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lowest in the Circle&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2195-8-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The base of our fingers does not commonly form a straight line. It’s more of a slight semi-circle. Within this circle, if the pinky is extremely low-set, it could mean that one lives in their dreams and aspirations. While this is not a bad thing, it could mean that they are too busy daydreaming. Thus, their goals may not get realized in the real world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Right along the ring finger&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2195-9-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;If the pinky finger is exactly the same height as the ring finger, it could belong to a power-hungry individual. The ambition of these persons could be admirable, but not carried out very well.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;It may be a worthwhile exercise to examine the hand of presidents, celebrities, even the tyrants of the world. There is a high chance that their ring and pinky finger could be equal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hence, such a trait would mean one has the ability to change the world. However, it also means that they can introduce some very dangerous elements to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Being a square&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2195-10-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The top part of the pinky finger also has a lot to say in terms of personality. If the pinky tip is somewhat squarish, it could mean that the person has several great qualities. They may speak their mind plainly, for one. This may land them into trouble or get out of it. It depends on the situation and how they wield their tongue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, this type of person may not be able to understand those who are sensitive to outspokenness. They may also be admired for their honesty. However, they would do well to learn a bit of diplomacy for the sake of communicating their arguments better. Such personalities may also become good leaders, albeit not aim to be one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The point of the pinky&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2195-11-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The pinky may also have a pointed tip, which again speaks volumes. This could tell us that the owner is probably an eloquent public speaker or writer. They may not even know it yet, but one could try steering them in that direction. In particular, this information just may help out teachers and parents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What makes these individuals so eloquent is their diplomacy and delicacy. They could hence teach their square-tipped counterparts quite a bit about these practices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fear in the curves&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2195-12-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The pinky finger does not have to be in line with the other fingers. In fact, its tip may curve away from other fingers. This usually signals a sort of fear, especially of confrontation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, one may take this in a positive or negative sense. The person with a curved pinky may only be in favor of peace. However, they could also be a bit of a coward. It is better if such individuals use their psychological traits to create bridges between those who are disconnected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Standing Apart&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2195-13-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;When the hand is viewed as a whole, the pinky finger may also naturally stand apart from the others. It could thus represent the signs of an independent mind. The tendency to think on one’s own is quite admirable, but it could again have negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the realm of relationships, for instance, such a person may need more space than others. They may not be as intimate or clingy as the other person would like. Talking out these situations is probably better than leaving them to fester and possibly explode later on, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Possibility of change&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2195-14-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;One question that many may ask is: Are these qualities set in stone? For instance, if a person trains themselves to have on that over another, their pinky may actually change. Some do claim that such a change is possible if one is young enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, a curved pinky finger could very well straighten out with enough dedication. In this case, one would need to confront their issues head-on and sort them out. However, this is not to say that a curved pinky is a bad sign, only that it could be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A hint of scam&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2195-15-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;A little intuition goes a long way, especially when you have pinky information on hand. Many people have been turned off by those with underdeveloped fingers. If the pinkies curl inwards, that’s probably a dangerous sign. Such individuals may be likely to scam others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the pinky alone should not be an indicator of negative or positive traits. There are probably other signs that may put an observer on their guard. For instance, one tends to get suspicious when there’s a lack of eye contact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What the ring says&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2195-16-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;If one finds gold and diamond rings on the pinky finger, it may be a sign of acquisition. The pinky ring could symbolize a lot of energy. The phalange on the ring fingers of is mysteriously short when it comes to wealthy folks, for instance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This means that while they may wear a ring there, money is not their driving force in their decisions. Simply put, they have never had to consider it as such. This may positively mean that they are more driven by loyalty and family values.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The left and the right&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2195-17-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the pinky on the dominant hand is shorter. If so, it probably means the owner has overcome an obstacle in their past. They are thus more likely to have dealt with their demons, especially if it’s something like a dysfunctional family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order to find out if this is the case, though, a heart-to-heart is in order. One needs to find out their past occurrences. It is also helpful to see what they have done to go beyond their childhood and come out strong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Phalange Factor&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2195-18-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The bottom phalange of the pinky finger is also important. A long and thick phalange here, for instance, represents an acquisitive tendency. Such individuals are thus likely to place importance on acquiring material wealth. This may be due to childhood factors or the way they were raised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One also has to interpret a thick bottom phalange by looking at those of other fingers. If their bottom phalanges are also thick and long, self-indulgence is probably the answer. Such individuals hence have trouble controlling themselves when it comes to eating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A Rare Occurrence&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2195-19-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikimedia &lt;p&gt;Moreover, some rare individuals have just one joint in their little finger. Some have more than the customary two, but it’s not clear what that means. However, one joint means that the bottom phalange is missing altogether. One may not be motivated by material things at all in such a case.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, one can only say that the pinky may be diminutive, but it is highly powerful. It could hence be a valuable tool in reading others as well as ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"19 Surprising Personality Traits Your Pinky May Reveal About You","description":"The pinky is one of the most telling fingers on our hands, if you can bring yourself to believe it"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/7/e4b4c2a396a71ba4e3eb069f90fc0c67_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/7/e9aec6e7cdeb6f1109242ad949eacb37_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"15 Actors Who Won’t Get out of Bed for Less Than $1 Million"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/7/d020a3c487fad5d203a0847f4b873b07_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"7 Cartoon Characters with Tragic Origins"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
