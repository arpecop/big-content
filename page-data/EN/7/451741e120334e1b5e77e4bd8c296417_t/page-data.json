Their spouse turns out to be unfaithful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And just then reality sets in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s easy to think you will leave if your spouse betrays you, but when confronted with the reality of divorce and dissolving your marriage, the stakes are really high. It’s not that overcoming the devastation of infidelity is easy, it isn’t. But it can be done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some may believe that cheating on your spouse is a combination of timing, circumstance, availability, and opportunity. This is the perfect recipe of adultery which hardly anyone can resist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We normally believe that a man will cheat if he is unhappy with his wife, right? You’ll be surprised to know that this is not always the case. According to various surveys and studies, half of the men who cheat on their spouse are actually very happy with their relationship. They are completely satisfied with whatever they have and do not want to have it any other way. Yet, they still tend to stray away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a recent male infidelity survey, 44 % of men cheated with a coworker, while 32 % had an affair with a friend. The survey also showed that men who cheated on partners with a work colleague were more drawn to certain professions than others. But honestly, if they had to cheat, they’ll cheat on you regardless of whether or not they have a job. Therefore, it cannot be pointed out that the man belonged to a certain profession and that is why he cheated or it was the job that provoked them to do so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As such, here are the top 8 jobs of unfaithful men.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Bartender&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1622.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;You guys must have already predicted this! This is one of the most obvious jobs on the list. The main factor that accounts for bartenders being on the top of the list is that they’re normally working late nights with people who are consuming large amounts of alcohol. This automatically raises a red flag. Adding on to this, bartenders get large amount of tips if they are more attractive and have a friendlier nature. This then increases the probability of them getting hit by customers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not like we are saying that bartender’s life is the easy life but without a doubt it is a continuous party in one way or another. That type of lifestyle does not create the stable environment supposedly needed in order to build a strong enough foundation at home to ensure that no one is willing to stray from the relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Real Estate Agents&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1623.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly enough, real estate agents makes it to the list as well. Though, they may not be suspected but are amongst the top cheaters. It may have something with the erratic hours or maybe they are so fully indulged in one’s personal lives starting from getting them a house that they cannot fully commit to their relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similarly, freelancers do not have a fixed working time and due to a lack of structured schedule and instability they are likely to cheat on their spouse. High divorce rates have a direct relationship with a lack of organized life lived by an individual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So whatever the case is, no matter how loyal you think your spouse is, take notice for any abnormal behavior.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Entertainers:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1624.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, entertainers makes it to the list as well. It is very complicated yet interesting to study entertainers. Entertainers may look very confident and energetic, but a high majority of entertainers suffer from depression, low self-confidence and other psychological issues. An amazing fact about entertainers is that they can perfectly hide their emotions. Therefore, they often go un-noticed, but they also lead to extreme and self-centered behaviors such as alcohol abuse, drug use, adrenaline-seeking activities and cheating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. I.T. Workers:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1625.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Internet, social media and chat rooms are the most common reason behind divorces. They make connections with people all around the globe easier and the anonymity gives many people a false sense of innocence. Since, I.T professionals spend a lot of time online, it’s no surprise that they may be found cheating on their spouse. A lot of I.T workers work on a freelance basis which has shown to factor into infidelity. Long hours and mental draining work can take a lot out of a person who is not on a structured schedule, which can make stress skyrocket and lead to unhappiness, which in turn can often lead to the first signs that infidelity is possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Firemen:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1626.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Divorce rates for fighters are higher than most other professions. The major reason behind all these divorces is a cheating spouse. Those who have prior experience related to firefighting knows that the biggest danger In this industry has nothing to do with smoke and fire, but with mental effects that can develop from working under such dangerous and sometimes traumatizing conditions. Firefighters normally are inclined to spend most of their time at the firehouse with their colleagues or at bars. Be at frustration or any other psychological issue, spending a lot of time away from home gives rise to questions such as what do they when they are not home for long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Nurses:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1627.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Nursing although is a very female dominated profession but the amount of male nurse have tripled since the 1970’s. It is an immensely stressful position weighed down with long shifts and the psychological burden of constantly being in contact with ill patients. This results in nurses having the highest rate of depression. Cheating is often used as a distraction tactic, much like drugs or alcohol, which might explain why nurses cave to cheating so frequently.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;7. Lawyers:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1628.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Lawyers are usually known for being unfaithful. It’s a joke really but like all jokes it does contain a little bit of truth in it. Not all lawyers lie, of course, and many of them usually are there to make a difference and do good but let’s be honest guys most of them are very good at manipulating the truth which what they usually get paid for (if you are guilty that is). So it’s not really much of a surprise to find out that lawyers land on the list of professions with the most cheaters too!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Stay at home moms:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1629.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The jobless mothers who stay at home, in their defense, have loads of work to do at home which is very stressing as their entire home is dependent on them and the isolation and boredom just adds up to the pile of stress as they start feeling like they are in this all alone and that’s definitely not what they signed up for. The partners tend to grow apart when the working spouse isn’t able to fulfil the needs and give them the time and attention they need. The reasons could be different in every case really. And so all these resentments lead on to an unhappy relationship which forces you to fulfil your needs by cheating on your spouse as that helps you get rid of some of the stress and let off some steam, or at least that’s what the housewives think.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Police:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1630.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Cops have long-since had a reputation for cheating on their partners. Between handling the role of authority along with irregular shift work, long hours and physical and mental stress, police officers already meet multiple criteria for committing adultery or infidelity. To top it all off, there is another factor working against them. You must have heard of ‘badge bunnies’. They especially hunt down cops who have been married to seduce. Yup! People like those exist. Not that we’re trying to defend police officers here but yeah it definitely shows us how why police officers are so likely to cheat on their spouse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Physicians:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1631.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The industry of physicians is not gender biased but numerous studies indicate that most of the physicians who tend to cheat on their spouses are mainly males. Anyone who is married to a female physician can now breathe a sigh of relief. What can I say really, they’re physicians right, so we can’t really expect them to keep they’re (emotions/ feelings) (bottled up/contained).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Teachers:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1632.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Feel insecure sending your kid to school? I’ll agree this is one of the most shocking professions to land on this list as it took me as a surprise as well. In fact, this profession is known to have the highest percentage of people that cheat on their significant others and this one is mainly reserved for the females. It doesn’t necessarily have to be one of the students, it could be anyone from the staff too. However, the teacher-student scandals that have popped up over a decade ago, have been increasing by huge numbers every day so beware and make sure you don’t lose your wife or your son to some teacher.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Doctors:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1633.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;A doctor cheating on their significant others with the hot nurses or other healthcare workers doesn’t just happen in tv shows. Male doctors have always had a reputation for having affairs and in their defense, they are constantly under pressure and so when the stress takes over you don’t think straight and you may choose to de-stress in the on-call room, in the company of a female colleague&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Salesmen:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1634.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock     &lt;p&gt;Salesmen are usually known for their lying skills, they truly are gifted with having a way with words, since they make things up on a daily basis. Therefore, they always know exactly what to say to get someone in the mood. In addition, when they go back home to their wives, they can come up with a perfect lie on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Survey Discloses the 13 Jobs Where Men Would Probably Cheat","description":"It is very common to hear people say “if my spouse ever has an affair, I’m outta here!” and then it happens.
