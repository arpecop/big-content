It is very private matter for both the individuals involved and it is something we experience in our own ways. Some may find it exciting while others may see it as a painful experience. However, when celebrities are involved in any such scandal, the news is bound to spread like wild fire. They have that global audience which follows them and people are obsessed with their famous celebrity’s lives. A thing as big as losing virginity is bound to be a hot gossip amongst the fans. Well when you are in the public eye it is hard to slip past unnoticed in a matter as big as losing your innocence to someone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following is a list of celebrities who are believed to have lost their virginity to other celebrities. It ranges from awesome to awkward and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Jack and Meg White&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2280.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Creativecommons  &lt;p&gt;The singing duo of White Stripes had the public fooled that they are siblings while in fact they were husband and wife who went way back in their relationship. It is believed they were high school sweet hearts who later married each other while of course performing together in the band. They tied the knot in 1996 and Jack took Meg’s last name. They later filed for divorce in 2000. The fact that they went so far back in their relationship with each other followed by marriage it is safe to assume that they were each other’s first lovers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Macaulay Culkin and Rachel Miner&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2281.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Creativecommons  &lt;p&gt;The “Home Alone” child star Macaulay Culkin and “Bully” starlet Rachel Miner passionately loved each other and decided to marry at a very young age in 1998. Their parents were against this matrimony as they did not see them compatible and it proved to be the case when they later split and went their separate ways in just two years after tying the knot. They filed for divorce in 2002 however they never really discussed their relationship in the media. The fact that they were so young when they ‘fell’ for each other to the point of marrying one another suggests a strong probability they lost their virginity to each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Macaulay Culkin and Mila Kunis&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2282.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via wonderwall  &lt;p&gt;It is hard to believe how Mila Kunis felt attracted to the guy not that we are hating on Culkin but due to his frequent run ins with bad press and over all troubled personality and career. Not to forget he recently got out of a relationship with Rachel Miner. Perhaps the fact that he was still very famous and retained some of his personal charm and appeal. Whatever the case maybe, both the celebrities started dating in 2002 and kept their relationship going for 8 years. They finally separated at 2011 and Mila later married Ashton Kutcher. About her relationship she could not pin point any specific reason except for Culkin’s “weird attraction” which she was drawn into. She made it clear she never wanted to marry the guy despite an eight year long relationship with him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Vanessa Hudgens and Zack Efron&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2284.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via zimbio  &lt;p&gt;Both the stars got their big break in movies by starring alongside each other in Disney’s famous “High School Musical”. They were both pretty young at that time and obviously spending so much time on set together naturally led them to spend more and more time off the set together as well. They spent five years together and before this long term relationship both did not have any notable relation with anyone. Especially Vanessa came from a conservative family and it is only natural to assume after 5 year long relationship she might have lost her virginity to Zac.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Kirsten Stewart and Michael Angarano&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2286.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Creativecommons  &lt;p&gt;Kirsten Stewart more commonly known for her role in twilight series and her romance on and off the screen to Robert Pattinson actually dated Michael Angarano before all that. Michael was her co-star in the film Speak and she was a much younger 14 years old at the time when she started dating him in 2004. The relationship between them lasted four years before Kirsten was shot to fame in Twilight series and moving to Robert Pattinson. The young age and a relationship of almost four years bound to have some serious consequences one of which is losing her virginity to Michael.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Jake Gyllenhaal and Taylor Swift&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2288.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via wiki &lt;p&gt;If you do not like to be in the limelight for wrong reasons or prefer to stay away from media attention regarding your love life stay away from romantic relationship with Taylor Swift. She would channel her grief into her work and as talented as she is you can be certain it will top the charts. That is what happened with Taylor Swift when she finally broke up with Jake Gyllenhaal after dating him for few months in 2010. Their relationship was quite serious and they were passionate about each other while it lasted. At least Swift was committed to the relationship so much so that she saw Jake as her future husband.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However Jake repaid all that love by not showing up at her twenty first birthday party which naturally devastated the talented singer. However she refused to give in to the defeat in love life and concentrated all her energies in her work giving public her highly successful album Red. The album was resonant with Swift’s bitter feelings towards Jake Gyllenhaal especially the hit single ‘Shake it off’.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;6. Beyoncé and Jay-Z&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2290.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Creativecommons  &lt;p&gt;Beyoncé never had a serious relationship before building the lifelong relationship with now husband Jay-Z. She only had one friend in her teen years and that never went towards anything significant. So it is basically implied that she dated one person in that capacity who is now her husband. She was 19 years of age when she started dating Jay-Z and eight years later married him in 2008 and have three children with him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2292.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Creativecommons  &lt;p&gt;They both performed together since their childhood when they first met on the set of “The Mickey Mouse Club”. The chemistry between the two signified something lifelong for Britney but Justin could not commit to the relationship owing to her rise to fame and uncomfortable closeness to her choreographer. From the way they dressed up to the way they gave interviews as a couple everything seemed picture perfect with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The people obsessed over them individually and their coupling was the greatest work of entertainment fictions fans could ask for. They had their parting of ways in 2002 when Justin announced their split. Considering they went so far back in their relationship and also both admitted to the fact of having slept with each other we can safely say they lost their virginity to each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Kim Kardashian and T.J Jackson&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2294.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Creativecommons  &lt;p&gt;The reality T.V star Kim Kardashian dated several people like Ray J. Damon Thomas, Reggie Bush and Kris Humphries before settling down with Kanye West. However there is one affair she openly admitted to in her teenage years with T.J Jackson which she attributes to her losing her virginity. She recalls how she approached her mom about her desire that she may end up having physical love-making and how her mom was supportive and understanding. She was just 14 when she started dating T.J Jackson, nephew of the famous Michael Jackson and member of the singing group 3T.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2296.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Creativecommons  &lt;p&gt;Both the stars are powerful celebrities in their own right and both of them falling for each other before the fluctuation between their relationship status became so much that everyone eventually lost their interest in them. However during their relationship together both could have been seeing cavorting together on beaches in quite a passionate way. Both spend a significant time together since their teenage years we can be sure of having a relation which was much more than meets the paparazzi’s eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2298.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Creativecommons  &lt;p&gt;Miley and Liam first met on the set of film The Last Song in June 2009, where they both were quite young and instantly fell in love with each other. On March 2010 they made their debut on the Red Carpet event as a couple thus confirming the rumors that they are indeed together in a relationship. However there were many heartbreaking separations and sweet reunions followed by more break-ups in their relationship over the years. Things got so serious that rumors of their engagement surfaced but it was eventually called off since the couple had a falling out between them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Joe Jonas to Ashley Greene&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2300.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Creativecommons      &lt;p&gt;Joe Jonas of the Jonas brother proudly sported the purity rings to show his resolve to stay a virgin until marriage. However after dating the likes of Taylor Swift and Demi Lovato, he was no longer sporting the ring. At 20 years of age he started dating Twilight series actress Ashley Greene. In an interview he confirmed he gave up his v-card at age 20 and that should be pretty obvious who he lost it to.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"12 Child Stars Who Lost Their Virginity with Each Other","description":"Your favorite stars and their shenanigans!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/7/7e3978afefaad444f2dd59c69877e367_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/7/7f8bcadcc0854eec55685d49482c2d97_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Working Mom Says Hiring a Housekeeper Is Smart and Not Lazy, Having Her Post Shared More Than 24,000 Times"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/7/75ad2175620b9b894f450b60240306f7_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"14 Absolutely Cheesy Texts from (So Called) Flirting Experts"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
