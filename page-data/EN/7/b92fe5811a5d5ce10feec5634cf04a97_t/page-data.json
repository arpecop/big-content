Pictures, along with speaking a thousand words, tell tales as old as time. They have the power to take you back decades and show you stories you couldn’t even think of.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even with all these smartphones having cameras nowadays, some people still cannot take a good picture to save their life. A good picture is one that transforms your surroundings and takes you into a new world. It tells you a story and empowers you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Keeping that in mind, we stumbled over a few pictures from the past that we’d like to share with you. These pictures definitely changed our perspectives and amazed us. One thing you’ll note is how they’re so much better than most of the pictures we come across on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These historical images will move you … in a good way. Let’s get right into it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#17: A Perfume Machine.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1837.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Recreo Viral &lt;p&gt;This old picture from 1952 tells you a lot about the styles used back then. For instance, look at the perfume machine. How many do you see around in this day and age? Also, the text and the stickers on it take you back a long time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lady’s makeup and dressing sense is also something rarely seen today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#16: The New York Skyline.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1839.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Via Imgur &lt;p&gt;The New York skyline, without its skyscrapers, still looks beautiful in this image from 1987. The only one that stands out is the Empire State building which, in all its glory, is still one of tallest buildings of New York.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The way the man places his picture on top of the Empire State Building as if to show that he is touching its tip, is still used in today’s day and age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#15: The Aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1841.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Gizmodo &lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the disastrous Chernobyl incident of 1986, many of the buildings and monuments remained there. They were, without a doubt, completely deserted and resembled a scene from a horror movie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, there were also a lot of cars left behind, as this aerial shot shows us. They’re parked in symmetry and make for a really good picture if only there wasn’t a load of sad incidents related to them. What makes the picture even beautiful is the color contrast of the parked cars. Quite an aesthetic, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#14: Flour bag fashion.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1843.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Hidden Fashion History &lt;p&gt;This image perhaps is the saddest one of them all. It depicts a flour company making patterns on their bags upon learning that mothers were using those to dress up their children due to their poverty during the Great Depression of the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is also considerate and shows a sense of unity from the flour companies towards the affected people. A good gesture, indeed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#13: The Youngest Soldier.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1845.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Conservative Political Forum &lt;p&gt;The youngest soldier of the Second World War was 6-year-old Al Seryozha Aleshkov. He was born in 1936 and was discovered by the Soviet troops while he was walking around in the forest. One of them adopted him and he was later used to bring ammunition to the soldiers during battle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was wounded during the battle of Stalingrad and taken to a hospital. Never setting foot in the battlefield again, Aleshkov studied to become a lawyer before his death in 1990.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#12: A cute little Koala.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1847.jpeg&quot;/&gt;WittyFeed &lt;p&gt;This cute little koala is drinking from a spoon. This photograph was taken back in 1900 in Australia. Where else would you expect to see animals doing all kinds of un-animal-like things?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#11: A Night at The Museum.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1849.jpeg&quot;/&gt;WittyFeed &lt;p&gt;Here we see the staff of a museum teaming up with archaeologists to prepare a dinosaur skeleton for viewing. As you can see, it took quite some effort, even back in 1916.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#10: An out-of-this-world mission.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1851.jpeg&quot;/&gt;SlovenskyViral &lt;p&gt;In this extremely nostalgic photograph from the 1970s, we see astronauts Thomas Strafford and Donald Slayton learning Russian in order to participate in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, which was the first joint U.S.-Soviet space venture.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;It lasted from July 15 to July 24, 1975.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#9: The Philosopher’s Fate.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1853.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;This photography depicts German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in an asylum after he got sick back in 1899. He used to be taken care of by his mother after that, until his death in 1900 at the age of 55.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#8: Deforestation.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1855.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Recreo Viral &lt;p&gt;We see two loggers cutting a redwood tree back in 1915 in Portland, Oregon. The methods that they are using are outdated and have been replaced by better ones today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The size of the Redwood is huge in comparison to the two men.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#7: Audrey Hepburn’s first passport.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1856.jpeg&quot;/&gt;A Tribute to Audrey Hepburn &lt;p&gt;Audrey Hepburn, a great British actress and entertainer, had her first passport made in 1936. She was seven at the time. This passport looks a lot like the ones used today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Who knew this little girl would grow up to be the one of the most prominent names in British cinema?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#6: The Giro d’Italia of 1973.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1859.jpeg&quot;/&gt;PicQuery &lt;p&gt;Cyclists are readying themselves for the 57th version of the Giro d’Italia, one of the most famous races in cycling. It commenced in Belgium on 18th May and ended on 9th June, 1973.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#5: Coat sale!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1862.jpeg&quot;/&gt;SlovenskyViral &lt;p&gt;This picture depicts a coat sale in Copenhagen in 1936. The coats have been hung up high on the street and people have started to come in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#4: The Legend!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1864.jpeg&quot;/&gt;SlovenskyViral &lt;p&gt;Jimi Hendrix, the legendary guitarist, has been pictured here with his first electric guitar in Seattle in 1956. Can anyone guess whether he had a successful music career or not?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#3: Dancing skyscrapers.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1866.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Vintage Everyday &lt;p&gt;Ballet dancers are showing what they’re all about on top of a skyscraper in New York City.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The year is 1925 and they are completely fearless. We can all count on the City of New York to come up with all sorts of madness, as almost a century later, nothing much has changed!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#2: Guarding the vitamins.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1868.jpeg&quot;/&gt;The Hamilton Spectator &lt;p&gt;Here we can see a police officer guarding a pharmacy in the floods of Ontario, California. Even in 1974, police officers were very dedicated to their jobs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It takes something to stand in the water for so many hours on end!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#1: Prom with me?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1870.jpeg&quot;/&gt;FaktenGuru &lt;p&gt;This prom party from 1895 shows maidens wearing dresses from olden time. They still look beautiful, though!&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;These are some of the most iconic pictures of our century that not only tell a story but also leave us awestruck with their perfection. They will stay the center of attention for future generations and even perhaps till the end of times or at least until we have technology up and running.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"17 Photos That Will Turn Your View of History Upside Down","description":"These historical pictures will blow you away!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/7/b92fe5811a5d5ce10feec5634cf04a97_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/7/c0a6a217e5e73632096fd3a51339a297_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Bizarre Side Effects After the Chernobyl Disaster"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/7/ac3bdc707300de350c0ebf28bc261af7_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"The 5 Zodiac Signs That Make the Most Dependable Friends"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
