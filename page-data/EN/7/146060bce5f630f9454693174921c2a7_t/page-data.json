This solo performance both written and performed by the talented hip hop artist made it to the top of U.S Billboard Hot 100 charts for three consecutive weeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This hit single released in June, 2017 really brought Cardi B into focus as she became the fifth female rapper to top the charts and the second female artist to do it on a solo performance.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; It’s the Holidays .Get you some @stevemadden thigh highs 😎&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  Cardi B Official IG (@iamcardib) on Dec 12, 2017 at 6:37pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is little to no doubt about her potential and there is a promising career ahead of her owing to her extraordinary talent. She is making all the right headlines and turning heads with her performances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, despite this natural talent of rapping and staying original she is still relying on artificial implants to enhance her look for the career. There is a large part of her identity which is based on artificial looks and she is not afraid to admit that and own up to those ‘manufactured’ looks. If you are a true fan follower of her music career you might know she fixed her crooked teeth as soon as she started make airwaves on the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; I️ said babe Issa snack! He said is a entree 😎&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  Cardi B Official IG (@iamcardib) on Dec 10, 2017 at 6:04am PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apparently you need to look a certain way in order to make a bigger splash in the music industry and Cardi B just knew what will fit the bill perfectly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before joining the music industry she used to be an exotic dancer and not too much flustered by the ‘required’ look. However as soon as she joined the Love and Hip Hop franchise she knew it is all about voluptuous body to engage with her fans on a deeper level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to her several interviews she does admit that going down this path of artificial enhancements is not healthy but at the same time it is what makes you look right for the business.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amongst several other reasons it was above all the competition she faced in the industry making her finally go with the decision to get butt implants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a young woman she had a strong impression formed that voluptuous bodies make women in this industry more attractive and how when she was 19 years old this idea appealed to her strongly. In an interview to Hot97 she said “Sometimes I felt like I didn’t get the lead in the music videos because I felt like I didn’t probably have enough ass”.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; We the most hated Hat5 Girls 😩😩😩💪🏾 @star_brim5&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  Cardi B Official IG (@iamcardib) on Dec 8, 2017 at 6:29pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She also made mention about one of her friends who convinced her about getting “her ass done” to make it big on the Hip Hop scene. Without disclosing the identity Cardi B wanted to be a lead in his music videos but he turned her down due to not meeting the desired look one needs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To make matters more difficult for her was the fact that she has a naturally slim figure and that translates into a skinnier butt. As a result to get that well-endowed butt she needed to opt for surgical implants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All these different reasons collectively pushed her to get her assets enhanced from an illegal setup in a home in Queens, New York. Despite the underlying health risks she still went ahead with her decision and Cardi B is not regretting it one bit, neither her fans.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; ME AND MINES ❤️😎MOTORSPORT!!!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  Cardi B Official IG (@iamcardib) on Dec 7, 2017 at 8:32pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If anyone has seen her videos on YouTube and other social media she has a certain air of confidence and authority be it on the stage or round the pole. The most notable of her dancing repertoire is the way she twerks which really make the audience go crazy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is no surprise then why enhancing her butt was kind of a big deal for her and maybe made her dance moves more notable.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;However a recently surfaced YouTube video of her dancing and twerking to some beats challenged the notion of whether she even needed to enhance those assets. Apparently she was doing fine without artificial enhancements but hey the fans love it and no one is complaining about it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Cardi B Was an Expert Twerker Even Before the Butt Implants...Here Is Video Proof!","description":"If you are even a little bit aware of the hip hop scene of the music industry you must have come across Cardi B’s Bodak Yellow."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/7/146060bce5f630f9454693174921c2a7_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/7/178eb803e2bf1728f57c5bc68beed8c7_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"30+ Hilarious Reactions to Melania Trump’s ‘Creepy’ White House Christmas Decorations"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/7/105e0d129762810cd369459420aa72b7_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"6 Unbelievable Animals Found FROZEN in Ice"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
