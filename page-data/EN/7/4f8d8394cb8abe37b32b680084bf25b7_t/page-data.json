They keep the secrets of their girlfriends, their siblings, and many other people in their life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it is also a very common fact that girls keep a lot of their own secrets to themselves. They don’t disclose them to anyone, may it be their husband, boyfriend, brother, father, sister, mother, friend, etc. This secretive attribute is found in a lot of girls. If you are girl reading this, you know exactly what is being talked about. And if you’re a guy reading this, then we’ll have you know that your girlfriend or wife is surely hiding a few things from you. That is, if you’re not single. Sorry, single folks. Surely you have female friends … right? Right?!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A very common question that comes to mind is, what is it that girls hide? What are those things that they don’t tell anyone? Here, we’ll be looking at exactly 15 things that girls hide from everyone. Let’s begin!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Checking up on exes.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-930.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;If a girl says that she is over her ex and doesn’t think about him anymore, she may be telling the truth. It is believable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But when a girl says that they’ve stopped checking on their exes and they don’t give a dime about what they’re up to these days, it is a sure fire sign that she is lying! Checking up on exes is something that every girl does, no matter how long ago the breakup happened and in what circumstances the relationship ended.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you thought stalking was unethical, well, you surely haven’t looked at it from a girl’s perspective. Girls stalk their exes not to see if they’re doing better or if they look better than before, but because they are bored and have nothing better to do sometimes. There isn’t a special reason, like wanting to get back or something. So, it’s totally fine. We know some boys who do it, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, however, girls stalk their current partner’s exes. There’s no biggie here as well, as they just want to compare themselves, which is pretty normal. So yes, this is one of the things that women hide from everyone!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Hygiene!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-931.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Hygiene, for some reason or the other, is associated more with women rather than men. However, one thing we have come to find out is that girls hide this, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to hygiene, girls can get pretty lazy sometimes. They sometimes don’t bother cleaning around, may it be the house, the room, or even themselves. They do it mostly because their partner is around. That’s it. Girls don’t even shower every day, unlike guys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also don’t wash their hair on a daily basis. Girls attribute this to being lazy and because these tasks come off as tiring. What a bummer!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Who cares about the money?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-932.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;With thousands of ‘gold-digger’ pranks circling social media in this day and age, it is a common belief that girls are gold-diggers, which means that all they care about is money. They disregard their potential partner’s look and even age, and go after the money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, this is not true at all. Bar a few exceptional cases, not all women are going to get impressed by an exotic date or your expensive Lamborghini. The only thing they do care about is the guy having a job and having a decent attitude about work. We all know the benefits of having a serious-about-life partner. However, this does not mean that girls want you to pay for their stuff, as well. Sometimes, they like paying the bill for a dinner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What girls really want is security, a sense of reassurance, savings, and happiness. They don’t necessarily want an exotic lifestyle. What they also want is to work hard on themselves and earn a successful life in that way, not by exploiting her partner’s finances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Think about this, guys!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. DID YOU JUST SAY KIDS?!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-933.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Most girls freak out when they hear the phrase ‘let’s have kids’.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kids are a full time responsibility, as we all know. Babysitting nephews and nieces is all good. But when it comes to having their own children, women do freak out. Wanting a baby is completely normal. But what guys don’t understand is that girls have to think about it long and hard. There a lot of questions that comes to their mind. Sometimes, they are not ready for pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a very tough thing to go through. Bearing a child in your body for nine months is not easy! This is something women hide. In reality, they actually get really scared when they hear something like this from their partners. Only when a woman feels she is completely ready does she opt for pregnancy. However, she’ll keep it a secret!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Delusions!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-934.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Whenever girls call their partners ‘kings,’ they don’t usually mean it.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;All they want is for you to be happy with them and keep them happy. They just need to be loved and felt important by their partners. However, calling their partners kings and treating them as such is only because they love you and care for you. This doesn’t mean that girls see their partners as kings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, girls don’t like it when a man is all about himself. They don’t really care about him being strong or having the walk and talk of a king. All they want is love and affection! They don’t want a king. They just want a good person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. We think your haircut sucks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-935.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;As much as we love complimenting you there are times when your attire just doesn’t compliment your personality. But for some reason you guys get easily offended if we tell you that your haircut sucks. If your girl doesn’t compliment you after you get a new haircut get the hint, IT SUCKS. We go through all that effort to look glam for you please notice! Yup, that’s how gross we are. So you see the extra effort we put in just so that you don’t start checking out every other girl you see on the streets?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. We lie and make excuses&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-936.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Who doesn’t lie to save themselves and appear all innocent? That’s another thing that we girls won’t hesitate killing you for, if you ever even think of lying to us. But in the end it’s to protect our marriage that we commit all these little sins. Also, you can forgive us for being little brats sometimes, can’t you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. We put in extra effort to look good for you&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-937.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;If it wasn’t for you guys, we would have stayed in the same pajamas for straight 3 days without even taking a bath. Yup, that’s how gross we are. So you see the extra effort we put in just so that you don’t start checking out every other girl in the streets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. It is how it is!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-938.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;As gross as it may be, we do all those things that guys do it the washroom. Especially when we girls live alone. I mean who cares what we do if it’s an all-girl’s apartment right? Using toilet bowls, or emptying the bladder in the shower, it doesn’t matter to us and neither should it matter to you! It’s not like we point fingers at what guys do and we all know how unhygienic you can get. So if you find this out about a girl months after knowing her, please don’t freak out its normal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ps keep it a secret will you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Fake or real?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-939.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Okay, there’s one thing you guys need to know! We DO NOT enjoy everything that you propose we do. Sometimes it turns out to be something entirely not meant for us. And when you ask again, we turn as deaf as a doorpost! We admit we initially take interest in the things you do only because we love you and we’d like to spend more and more time with you. But come on, take the hint. We can’t like everything you do. If it’s about gaming, sure we can have a match or two, with you. But after that we expect you to give some time to “us”. So sometimes when we pretend to be over excited or too happy maybe, just maybe, we’re faking it. And other times when we ignore you then stop knocking at our door.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. There’s nothing wrong in spicing it up!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-940.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;How long can the excitement last? Eventually you run out of stuff to try. Especially when it’s just the two of you. One day it’ll all become mundane and it’s then you need to spice things in your life. Most men get offended at the idea of having anything partner. JEEZ! The world doesn’t revolve around you. It’s not because you’re a boring old bum in bed or because you no longer arouse our interest. Maybe it’s because it will make things more interesting? Besides the heart is with the person it belongs to. No harm in adding another partner eh?&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Guys! It’s about time you realized that not everything we say is true. We are pretty good at faking things. We might look all fine and happy from the outside, but on the inside, there’s a whole story going on. We overthink A LOT of stuff, even if we don’t admit that.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"11 Secrets All Women Keep from Men","description":"Take a look at these mind-boggling things girls hide from others!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/7/4f8d8394cb8abe37b32b680084bf25b7_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/7/52de90c5eb2415ebd37b4e66db8dd787_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Smart People NEVER Choose Their Seats Randomly"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/7/478c586702be76b6783a95f603d17bb7_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Choose a RUNE What You Pick Will Reveal What the Future Holds for You"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
