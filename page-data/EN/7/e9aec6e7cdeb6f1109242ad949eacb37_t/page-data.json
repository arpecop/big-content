In the old days, they were the ones who decided the salaries and other perks the performers would be getting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today and we see that the game has changed completely. The old days have passed and now it is the performers who have the power to decide their salaries. The reason for that is that budgets have rose and audiences have grown. Hollywood movies are popular all across the world and so are these actors. Hence, they are being paid an immense amount of money to appear in movies. Some of them are even Oscar winners and the heroes of huge box office successes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s almost as if a million dollars don’t even appeal to these stars anymore. If you’re curious about who these actors and actresses are, just take a look at the list below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#15: Mark Wahlberg.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1264.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikimedia &lt;p&gt;The young lad who once danced in his underwear while rapping has made it quite big in the film industry. Proving himself in &lt;em&gt;Boogie Nights (1997)&lt;/em&gt;, Mark Wahlberg made quite a name for himself. Further successes include the comedies &lt;em&gt;Ted, The Other Guys, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Daddy’s Home.&lt;/em&gt; The star has even appeared in a &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;/em&gt; movie and has recently topped the list of Forbes’ Highest Paid Actors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His versatility is what increases his demand so much. Nowadays, if Mark Wahlberg is starring in a movie, it will surely attract viewers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#14: Brad Pitt.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1265.jpeg&quot;/&gt; wikimedia &lt;p&gt;The actor who was paid only $6000 for his appearance in &lt;em&gt;Thelma &amp;amp; Louis&lt;/em&gt; back in 1991 has now come quite some way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brad Pitt started racking up salaries along the lines of $5 million just four years later. His good looks were an added bonus to his talent and he delivered some amazing performances as the years passed. As &lt;em&gt;Ocean’s Eleven&lt;/em&gt; arrived on the horizon, Pitt was already making some huge money, earning $30 million per role. Soon after, he kept on piling up roles after roles for $20 million plus each and to this day, earns quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Movies such as &lt;em&gt;Fury&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;War Machine&lt;/em&gt;, while not quite similar to his other blockbusters, still managed to boost up his net worth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#13: Johnny Depp.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/c-users-ammar-ahmed-downloads-22-11-3-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikimedia &lt;p&gt;Johnny Depp always preferred a few selected movies such as &lt;em&gt;Edward Scissorhands&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ed Wood&lt;/em&gt;, where he had to dress up as fictional characters. However, his appearance in &lt;em&gt;21 Jump Street&lt;/em&gt; surprised everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His fame skyrocketed with the role of &lt;em&gt;Jack Sparrow&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Carribean&lt;/em&gt;. For the later parts of the franchise, Depp was already in the $20 million club. One of his other notable successes includes &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;, too. However, the sequels to both those films disappointed hugely and Depp took quite a dip. Accusations of abuse against his ex-wife did some damage to his image but he is still regarded as a well-known star.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even for a small cameo in &lt;em&gt;Murder on the Orient Express&lt;/em&gt;, he has managed to rack up about $20 million.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#12: Melissa McCarthy.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1266.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikimedia &lt;p&gt;Melissa McCarthy initially appeared as Sookie from the show &lt;em&gt;Gilmore Girls&lt;/em&gt; and had small cameos in movies such as &lt;em&gt;Charlie’s Angels.&lt;/em&gt; Her weight was something critics thought would not let her progress further but then she came up with an Oscar-nominated role in &lt;em&gt;Bridesmaids.&lt;/em&gt; The same year she won an Emmy for &lt;em&gt;Mike &amp;amp; Molly &lt;/em&gt;and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Movies like &lt;em&gt;Identity Theft &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Heat&lt;/em&gt; made her more popular, as she started demanding around $10 million for each role. Her other movies have also done quite well with very flew blips. She also is a writer, which helps her price, as she has three movies ready for 2018.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#11: Adam Sandler.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1267.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikimedia &lt;p&gt;Adam Sandler started off with &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live &lt;/em&gt;and earned the title of the king of comedy. Hits such as &lt;em&gt;Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Waterboy&lt;/em&gt; further helped his case by doing very well on the box office. Lately, Sandler has fallen from his high horse due to poor movie selection. His roles in &lt;em&gt;Jack and Jill &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Pixels&lt;/em&gt; were quite terrible, but they still fetched him $20 million each.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His work in &lt;em&gt;Hotel Transylvania &lt;/em&gt;got him just $5 million, but he is still known as a big name in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#10: Leonardo DiCaprio.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1268.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikimedia &lt;p&gt;When Leonardo DiCaprio won his first Oscar in 2016, it was just the cherry on top of an amazing career. &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt; was the movie that skyrocketed his career and roles in &lt;em&gt;The Aviator &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Departed&lt;/em&gt; fetched him around $20 million each. Once, he accepted just $1 million only to work with Quentin Tarantino in &lt;em&gt;Django Unchained&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Otherwise, films such as &lt;em&gt;The Revenant &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Wolf of Wall Street&lt;/em&gt; earned him $20 million each. However, DiCaprio uses most of his money for charity and preserving the environment, but even the smallest of roles rack up at least a million dollars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#9: Sandra Bullock.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1269.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikimedia &lt;p&gt;Sandra Bullock earned just $600,000 for her role as the driver in &lt;em&gt;Speed.&lt;/em&gt; However, comedies such as &lt;em&gt;While You Were Sleeping &lt;/em&gt;helped her reach the $1 million mark. She further made her claim to fame with movies such as &lt;em&gt;A Time to Kill &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;28 Days.&lt;/em&gt; However, after a slump in the early 2000s, she made a great come back with movies like &lt;em&gt;The Proposal&lt;/em&gt; that earned her $8 million.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Blind Side &lt;/em&gt;was also a huge success, bagging her around $20 million. In 2013, she starred in &lt;em&gt;The Heat&lt;/em&gt;, that earned her $10 million. She has also won an Oscar and has made quite a big name for herself in the industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#8: Vin Diesel.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1270.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Vin Diesel took his time to rise to fame with movies such as &lt;em&gt;Saving Private Ryan&lt;/em&gt; and others. He earned around $400,000 for the sci-fi success &lt;em&gt;Pitch Black.&lt;/em&gt; However, with the &lt;em&gt;Fast and the Furious&lt;/em&gt; franchise, his demand rose and by the time &lt;em&gt;XXX&lt;/em&gt; arrived, he has made a huge name for himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, a lot of flops cost him his credibility but he somehow managed to rack up big money for his role as Groot from &lt;em&gt;The Guardians of the Galaxy.&lt;/em&gt; He hasn’t really proved himself outside of &lt;em&gt;F&amp;amp;F&lt;/em&gt;, but still knows how to capitalize on his opportunities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#7: Julia Roberts.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1271.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikimedia &lt;p&gt;Julia Roberts was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in &lt;em&gt;Steel Magnolias&lt;/em&gt; and this was what rose her to fame. Her later roles in movies such as &lt;em&gt;Pretty Woman&lt;/em&gt; won her a lot of credibility and made her a household name in the industry. She backed those performances up with another hit in &lt;em&gt;The Pelican Brief&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Erin Brockovich&lt;/em&gt; won her a first Oscar and skyrocketed her back to the top. She started earning around $20 million per picture and that made her the go-to female star of Hollywood. She still dominates her place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#6: Will Smith.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1272.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikimedia &lt;p&gt;Will Smith started off as a rapper and went by the name “The Fresh Prince”. His rapping career led to a sitcom that was a huge success. However, his first few movies did not do much at the box office. Then came movies like &lt;em&gt;Bad Boys &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Independence Day&lt;/em&gt; that earned him $7 million collectively.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Movies like &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Collateral Beauty &lt;/em&gt;got him around $10 million each. He has amazing charisma that makes him one of the highest paid African-American actors to ever grace the industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#5: Jennifer Lawrence.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1274.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winter’s Bone&lt;/em&gt; paid Lawrence just $3000 a week but that was the movie that raised her to fame. Movies such as &lt;em&gt;Silver Linings Playbook, The Hunger Games, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Passengers&lt;/em&gt; got her huge amounts of money and she skyrocketed into Forbes’ list of highest paid actresses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At such a young age, she has an amazing payday and has proven her worth many times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#4: Emma Stone.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1276.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikimedia &lt;p&gt;Roles in &lt;em&gt;Superbad &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Spiderman&lt;/em&gt; did quite some favors to Stone’s name in the industry. Similarly, &lt;em&gt;Easy A &lt;/em&gt;was a box office success and Stone was soon getting millions for roles in movies such as &lt;em&gt;Crazy Stupid Love&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;La La Land, &lt;/em&gt;for which she even won an Oscar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She has constantly proven that she’s the best in the business, racking up $26 million dollars at such a young age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#3: Tom Cruise.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1278.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikimedia &lt;p&gt;Tom Cruise is the most unsurprising name on this list. Movies such as &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;op Gun, Rain Man, A Few Good Men, The Frim and the Mission: Impossible series made him a rich man long before the high salaries of today. He further made his claim to fame by earning around $20 million for movies such as War of the Worlds and Rock of Ages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, with a Top Gun sequel right around the corner, Cruise is set to earn about $28 million and prove to everyone he’s still got it, even at age 55.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#2: Tom Hanks.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1280.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikimedia &lt;p&gt;Tom Hanks is one of the nicest guys in Hollywood. That has also led to his success. He demanded high salaries for movies such as &lt;em&gt;Big&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Bonfire of The Vanities&lt;/em&gt; and proved his worth by winning an Oscar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He broke the bank by earning $20 million a picture after &lt;em&gt;Forrest Gump &lt;/em&gt;did ridiculously well at the box office. He’s an occasional director and is among the best in terms of Oscar wins and hits. Therefore, he is quite a huge demand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#1: Dwayne Johnson.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1281.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Being a former professional wrestler, Dwayne Johnson first appeared in &lt;em&gt;The Mummy &lt;/em&gt;as The Scorpion King showed his potential and soon he became a big name in the industry. &lt;em&gt;The Game Plan &lt;/em&gt;made for further success along with hits such as &lt;em&gt;Fast 5,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Central Intelligence, Moana, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;San Andreas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;He also stars in a comedy show called &lt;em&gt;Ballers &lt;/em&gt;and earns $650,000 for each episode.
