She was born in Tokyo and studied at Parsons the New School for Design. She was in Iceland and was holding casting sessions. Twins, Erna and Hrefna showed up to this casting. Ariko was mesmerized by the beauty and mystery of the twins and since then, she visited them every year to photograph their development. This gave birth to her project “Twins”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1352.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Ariko Inaoka &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1353.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Ariko Inaoka &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1354.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Ariko Inaoka &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1355.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Ariko Inaoka &lt;p&gt;She had gone to Iceland to shoot because the landscapes reminded her of her hometown and the twins seemed like the perfect embodiment for the beauty of the landscape. She visited the twins for the first time when they were 6 and then when they were 9. Ever since, she visited them yearly. She wants to see how the twins will look like when they are 17.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1356.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Ariko Inaoka &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1357.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Ariko Inaoka &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1358.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Ariko Inaoka &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1359.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Ariko Inaoka &lt;p&gt;She believes the twins might have a deep psychological connection and even have a telepathic connection. Erna and Hrefna barely ever fight. They connect on a deeper level and are even known to have similar dreams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Through these pictures, Ariko wanted to capture the physical and psychological development of the twins and that she has done beautifully through these series of pictures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1360.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Ariko Inaoka &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1361.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Ariko Inaoka &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1363.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Ariko Inaoka &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1365.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Ariko Inaoka     &lt;p&gt;These pictures truly bring about a sense of my beauty and mystery in the viewer. The simplicity and the progress of the twins over time give a feeling of life and a sense of being part of the greater world.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"A Japanese Photographer Has Taken Photos of Twin Girls from Iceland Every Year to Show Their Transformation from Children to Teenagers","description":"Ariko Inaoka is a Japanese photographer.
