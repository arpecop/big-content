However it is still too generalized to apply to everyone as each individual is as unique as our finger prints. Still we can have a general idea of some of the major characteristics of each individual with the help of their sun sign. Just like our personality traits astrology also sheds some light on how an individual will turn out in terms of friendship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After all we need someone to act as our support system outside of family, someone we can turn to when we want support or just want to spend quality time. Friendship offers an outlet to discuss whatever is bothering you and come up with suggestions that may be helpful. They are the individuals who seemingly share similar interests and preferences. We connect with them in a very different manner and can relate with them much easily.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is always good to know beforehand who would turn out be reliable and who would leave you at the first sign of trouble. Following are the zodiac signs which exhibit the most desirable traits one look for in a friend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Aries&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1115.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;One of the most loyal friends one could ask for, they will always stand up for their friends no matter what. Mostly blamed as the most self-centered and absent of empathy but when push comes to shove they are the one you could completely rely on. In moments of need they never forget their friends and do anything in their capacity to help their friends out. They actually suffer from appearing as neglectful due to their focused approach on their objectives. Once they set their eyes on something they might not accommodate anyone else which is often perceived as being too selfish. However if you disregard their superficial arrogance you will realize they are the most dependable friends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They give lot of attention and love and expect repaying of those warm feeling in equal measure. If they become harsh in a friendship chances are they felt deeply wronged and coming from a place of respect and love. They are emotional but equally good in expressing those emotions. If only they could improve their short tempered attitude and impatience they could be the best people to make friends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Virgo&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1116.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;It is very hard to make Virgo a friend because of their extremely strict standards in making friend. However if you do end up making friends you should consider yourself as someone who could easily pass for being classy. Virgo do not make friends easily but once they do you have a person who will try their best to lend you a helping hand whatever the situation. They have this uncanny ability to solve the problems of their friends very easily something which comes naturally to them.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;They are brutally honest in their feedback something which may harm the friendship more than benefit it. However at least you would know the friendship is not some artificial relationship rather you would turn to them for some serious opinion on matters concerning you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Scorpio&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1117.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Scorpio are the most reliable friends one could look for as they will literally take your secret to the grave with them. Apart from being good confidants they are also very careful of keeping their friends from hurting. Infact they would do anything to cheer you up if they see you down in the dumps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They share the Virgo’s affinity for telling the truth albeit in a more tactical manner which may not come across as harsh as in Virgo’s case. They have strong principles which they do not feel like compromising hence they will stick to their guns but will deliver the truth in the most acceptable manner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Capricorn&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1118.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Few of the most responsible individuals they will always give their 100% to the friendship and will be on the lookout for the favor to be returned. Individuals under this sun sign believe that actions speak louder than words and they commit to the relationship earnestly. However at the slightest hint of disinterest or perceiving they are not being appreciated they will end the friendship abruptly. They like to take charge of the situation and often solve the problems in a very effective manner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since they are responsible in their decision-making they are averse to the idea of taking risks or making spontaneous plans. They prefer predictable outcomes and it is not wise to impose on them otherwise. The best thing is their big heartedness as they will always be ready to forget and forgive the past mistakes and accept friendship again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Taurus&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1119.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Another sign with horns which also suffer from stubbornness but that is easily overshadowed by their loyalty to their friends. They are to remain there until the end and no matter what the circumstances are you could always approach a Taurus for help.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;One of the great things about Taurus is the fact that they are approachable and easily develop friendship with anyone and everyone. They are not selective at all and try to be as friendly as possible to everyone they come across.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"The 5 Zodiac Signs That Make the Most Dependable Friends","description":"You can always count on them"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/7/ac3bdc707300de350c0ebf28bc261af7_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/7/b92fe5811a5d5ce10feec5634cf04a97_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"17 Photos That Will Turn Your View of History Upside Down"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/7/90608934db6d5b36e0be7b1305b662b7_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Which Body Part You Should Flaunt Based on Your Zodiac Sign"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
