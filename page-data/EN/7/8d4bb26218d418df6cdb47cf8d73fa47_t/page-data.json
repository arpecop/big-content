Robes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-545.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;At first, we did not know whether to love or despise the robe style trend. We could not help but think that long coats look a little bit too much like the bathrobe you wear after you step out of the shower. But like most fashion trends, it did not take much time to convince us that robes are not only cool but are the great fashion piece ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These luxe items come in a variety of fabrics, from cotton to silk, and you have no need to wear them all tied up like a typical bathrobe either.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can experiment with your robe and rock it any way you desire. We have seen some style lover tie their robes around their waist, while other has worn it wide open to show off the stylish cloth, they were wearing underneath. You can also convert it into a wrap dress and pair it with some funky heels. This fashion trend quickly made its way from the runway to the streets. And now everyone is in love with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5.

Slides&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-547.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Previously you probably only saw someone wearing a pair of slides at a beach party or pool. And other time, these sandals never really saw the light of the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Honestly, nobody ever thought that this slip-on would ever be considered a part of luxury fashion. But it has finally happened. It seems like every brand now has a pair of slides available in their stores and from Rihanna’s Fenty collection with a Puma to Givenchy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Slides have revamped so that they look amazing with almost any outfit.

There was just something about them that was intriguing, but many fashionistas stayed away from them at all costs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They were definitely marketed toward more mature style lovers and just the sight of them caused some people to feel a bit intimated. The younger generation of clothing experts completely wrote fishnets off with giving them proper chance to win us over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But they refused to be blackballed from the fashion industry. In fact, they have proven that there is so much to love about them. Nowadays many style obsessed people are figuring out that fishnets just might be the craziest accessory ever. They are popping everywhere. Their old reputation has been forgotten and now they have even received the seal of approval from luxury fashion designers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1.

When 90’s ended many people thought that it was the last time they ever see off the fitted necklaces. But chokers had other things in mind and they were just way too cute to stay in the distant past. Suddenly they were front and center in every single fashion magazine.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;They were spotted on every Hollywood actress neck and everyone realized that they are officially backed in more strong forms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Fashion Items That Went from CRINGE to COOL","description":"The best part about fashion is you can wear whatever you want whenever you want.
