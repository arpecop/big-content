The blast released enormous amounts of radioactive material into the atmosphere, immediately endangering life around the area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The accident occurred during a safety test. Station blackout power-failures were being simulated with safety systems turned off. The catastrophe occurred due to a number of factors. For one, there were flaws in the way the reactor was built. Additionally, test conducting methods were contrary to the checklist provided to the reaction operators.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because of these unsuitable reaction conditions, some water leaked into steam, resulting in a gigantic steam explosion and an eventual graphite fire that broke into the air. Since these unfortunate events have unfolded, life in Chernobyl has never been the same.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Horrific side effects of the accident are still visible to this day, but people still wonder what the more bizarre ones could be. In light of that, this article will be taking you by the neck and immersing you deep into the radioactive depths of Chernobyl. Make sure to have your hazmat suit on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. The Animals.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1198.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking Chernobyl is home to all kinds of scary mutated animals you see in video games, you’re wrong. However, it’s not as if animals are normal back there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Insects are of the same size, just less in quantity. However, there have been sightings of tiny insects with deformed wings, bent legs, and crooked antennae.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Considering people keenly visit Chernobyl, would you want to come here after reading this? Just to let you know, the ‘fun’ part hasn’t even begun yet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Effect on people&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1200.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Scary for Kids &lt;p&gt;With insane amounts of radiation in the Chernobyl air, people have been affected the most.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the radiation isn’t exactly handing out superpowers like you might see in some movies. There’s no super strength, magical laser-shooting abilities, or superhuman speed; none of that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, the radiation has got to human eyes. It has deformed them and has left them with an abnormal rate of growth. It has also attributed to the formation of cataracts which is another awful side effect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s safe to say that living in Chernobyl is not recommended at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Hydrocephalus.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1202.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur &lt;p&gt;Hydrocephalus is when an excess amount of cerebrospinal fluid accumulates throughout the brain. It causes increased pressure inside the skull and is usually found in babies. They are either born with it or may acquire it later in life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the plethora of radiation blanketing the Chernobyl atmosphere has caused premature hydrocephalus in babies. It is one of the strangest deformities in which the head enlarges to an abnormal size. However, treatments are available for this dreadful condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Plants.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1204.jpeg&quot;/&gt;fanpop &lt;p&gt;Despite the horrific amounts of radiation that have engulfed Chernobyl, plants still grow there. In fact, they have adapted to the radioactive environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result, their growth rate has diminished. In addition to that, they have developed certain proteins and compounds in order to shield themselves from the radioactive threats that lurk in the surrounding atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;6. Unnatural limb development.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1206.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Strange Remains &lt;p&gt;Another weird effect of overexposure to radiation is that children born in that area aren’t undergoing proper limb development.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many children are born with deformed limbs and others, with no limbs at all. People who suffer these deformities have to resort to prosthetic limbs and in most cases, they can’t even afford them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Natural Waste.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1208.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Redbubble &lt;p&gt;Because of radiation, old trees and plants are not decomposing as they should. If you thought plant growth was a wonder, wait until you read this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Old plants are just collecting in the Chernobyl area now. The reason for this is that along with insects, microbes have also decreased in quantity. Therefore, there are not many natural decomposers to break down vegetation in an efficient way. Debris is just accumulating around the Chernobyl area now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Mental Health.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1210.jpeg&quot;/&gt;imgur &lt;p&gt;Radiation also has a harmful effect on mental health. It has plagued newborn babies with hampered brain development and added mental disorders such as stress. Young ones suffer a lot from these problems, along with the fear of an ‘invisible enemy.’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All this is too hard on the children and as a result, has caused unimaginable mental disabilities in them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Animal populations.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1212.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly enough, animal populations have not fallen, what with all the radiation and stuff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, there’s been a rise in wildlife presence near the Chernobyl area. A bump has been seen in the population of elks and deer. Henceforth, animal populations have not been affected by the radioactive waste. It could also be an indication to the fact that animal species thrive whenever humans are not around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seems strange, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. A ghost town.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1213.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Due to the horrific nuclear accident so many years ago, there is hardly any sign of human life around Pripyat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People evacuated the place long ago, which is now considered to be a ghost town. Everywhere you look, you will see hotels, apartments, and fairgrounds. However, all of it is slowly decaying away due to the fact that humans left the place over thirty years ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pretty scary, huh?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Tourism.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1214.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Despite the infamous nuclear accident, tourism in Chernobyl has seen a boom. People come to visit from all over the world in order to explore the empty wastelands that have been swallowed by radioactive waste. However, it is a most bizarre location to have a vacation in.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Would you ever visit Chernobyl?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Bizarre Side Effects After the Chernobyl Disaster","description":"Most of these side effects will surprise you to the core!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/7/c0a6a217e5e73632096fd3a51339a297_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/7/c71447eecc2323482c5de71113023c17_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"9 Origins of Famous Phrases I Bet You Didn't Know"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/7/b92fe5811a5d5ce10feec5634cf04a97_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"17 Photos That Will Turn Your View of History Upside Down"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
