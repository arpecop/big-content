How cool were we? This habit has now transformed into a generational trait. Most adults, teenagers and even kids nowadays are staying up at night way more than what is advised. It’s essential to keep tabs on your sleeping routine because without it you’re cheating on your body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The body is a complex organism which bolts up like a tweezer when it isn’t being treated right. It will give you mixed signals telling you that you’re doing something wrong. Just like that, sleep is a very important part of a human being’s day. The mind and body work at optimal capacity when the sleeping routine is healthy. So let’s look at a few indicators by our body telling us to sleep better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Weight Gain&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1626.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.shutterstock.com&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s a common conception of relating health with weight. It’s pretty tricky because if you eat too much you gain weight, if you eat too less you lose wait. So many are confused as to how to go about it. I’d advise all those who are reading this, to forget about that dilemma as I may have a scapegoat solution for you. Start sleeping more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a study, people who are sleep deprived eat 300 calories a day, which is more than they would eat if they had a functional sleeping routine. Lack of sleep also releases cortisol, a stress hormone that signals to the body that it needs to get fat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Impaired Thought Processes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1627.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.shutterstock.com&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sitting in the middle of an exam trying to find the answers in your fuzzy head, have you ever wondered how much better your exam would have been had you gotten enough sleep? Well, I have. You see when the brain does not get enough rest it becomes rusty and slow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The levels of concentration and focus are at an all-time low. Did you know that going without one night of sleep can alertness and mental processes by 30%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Emotional Problems&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1628.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.shutterstock.com&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;No doubt you’re in for a rough morning lecture if your professor didn’t sleep well the night before. It has been proven time and again by different researches that sleep deprivation is the biggest cause for crankiness. These studies show a link between sleep deprivation and lesser emotional control/stability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If it goes on long enough sleep deprivation can even cause depression. Not that we don’t already have enough reasons to be depressed. We just need a good sleep so that we don’t turn into squid ward from sponge bob.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Poor Memory&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1629.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.shutterstock.com&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a world where time is of the essence and you need to memorise the schedule you’ve built for yourself, you need your brain to remember all the things you have to do. Sleeping lesser than you actually should hinders that factor of success. Memory is key in order to be reliable, be it work, business or even university courses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that the REM waves which people experience when they get a good night’s sleep help in boosting memory and other important mental functions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Decreased Immune System&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1630.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.shutterstock.com&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;When your body does not get enough rest, it won’t be able to bounce back from an infection the same way it used to. Sleep deprivation is a major cause for lack of white blood cells and platelets in the body. These cells maintain a solid and resolute body immune system. It will be very easy to catch diseases like the common cold or the flu for people who don’t sleep well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This can generally be a barrier in carving out a happy and sustainable life. If you’re vulnerable, you might get knocked down and have to spend way too many days in bed. I’m sure your boss will definitely not be happy about that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Decreased Sex Drive&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1631.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.shutterstock.com&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, here’s something we didn’t know! I’m sure no one wants to live a life where we have to marginalise our sexual desires just because our body cannot cope with them. If we don’t get enough sleep the body automatically says no to sex. I mean who would want that? Many studies have linked long-term sleep deprivation with a decreased libido.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;This is mainly because of the hormonal changes that tend to occur when somebody hasn’t gotten enough sleep and because of the lack of energy present in the human body without proper sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Decreased Longevity&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1632.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.shutterstock.com&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unless you don’t want to live till 60, this part won’t bother you that much but it’s pretty serious business. Everyone wants to live a long and healthy life but chronic sleep deprivation has the power to pop that bubble.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In one study it was shown that women who tend to sleep 5 hours or less per night over a lifetime were less likely to live as long as those who get the appropriate amount of sleep that is required. This tends to be happen mainly because of the chronic stress that is inflicted on the body due to sleep deprivation&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Heart Disease&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1633.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.shutterstok.com&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;In many countries around the world, heart diseases are the number one cause of death. That tills you about the amount of vice accumulated in this deadly disease. People think it’s easy to prevent heart disease if you eat healthy. Well, that’s not entirely true.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You have to sleep healthy too. Sleep deprivation can also raise blood pressure levels. It is linked with heart diseases because of the already established link between sleep deprivation and weight gain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Injuries and Accidents&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1634.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.shutterstock.com&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;This one is actually right there. If you haven’t slept enough the previous night and you have miles of driving to do in the morning the situation would be no better than drinking and driving at the same time. A fuzzy and unclear mind is very dangerous when you’re controlling a vehicle which is at times responsible for the lives of many people, be they related to it or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Sleep Foundation statistics show us how accidents and injuries are more likely to influence our decision making ability, and it is mostly negative influence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Chronic Disease&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1635.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.shutterstock.com&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although we’ve already touched on this bit quite a few times now, but the fact that I gave this a separate paragraph means it is extra important to understand this. Chronic diseases are no joke, they can shatter your life right in front of your eyes and you won’t even know what happened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lack of appropriate sleep can lead to many chronic diseases such as heart diseases, diabetes, strokes, obesity and what not. So, it’s important for us to understand how staying far away from these diseases would benefit us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, yes we’ve told you almost all that you need to know about the pros and cons of sleep deprivation. Oh wait. There are no pros here. It’s all just cons. But don’t worry we won’t just leave you hanging like that. We’ve got your back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s this special edition freebie advice for you on how to avoid sleep deprivation. The consequences involved here may be severe but the good news is that we have found simpler ways for you to give your body the rest it so rightfully deserves&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Planning&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nothing in life comes easy and just like that the solution to your sleeping problem won’t be handed to you in a plate, you will have to plan it out. You will have to carve out a routine for yourself that gives you at least 7-8 hours of sleep daily.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Punctuality&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you have set the plan in motion, you have to stick to it. This means you have to give yourself a talking-to if you’re slacking off in the attempt to fix your sleeping routine. You can help yourself by fixing a time period or a time frame in which you just have to sleep or wake up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Setting the mood&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sleep is considered a natural paradise for certain people who get lost in the abyss of their own imagination just before they go to bed. That doesn’t just happen out of the blue. They know how to set the mood. They know what makes them sit back, relax and let go. They garner an environment that suits their needs and eventually turn it into the norm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That is why such people are so incredibly successful in staying away from all the cons possessed by sleep disorder. They know the art of setting the mood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Avoidance&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sacrifices have to be made whenever you’re doing something of magnitude. The same case applies here. If you want sleep to come to you and not the other way around, then you need to stay away from a few things and avoid their usage or consumption completely.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;First one is the ever dangerous sugar that sends certain people up and down an emotional rollercoaster if they have a lot of it before bed. Then we have caffeine which is the nemesis of sleep. Finally, heavy meals before bed should be replaced with a light healthy snack&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Signals From Your Body Telling You Should Sleep More","description":"Some interesting facts about sleep."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/7/6c3664ed23ae698b2369336100bbfd07_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/7/75ad2175620b9b894f450b60240306f7_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"14 Absolutely Cheesy Texts from (So Called) Flirting Experts"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/7/64011ee1c802d1e6ee2dee4624571667_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"15 Manipulation Tricks That Men Still Haven’t Cracked"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
