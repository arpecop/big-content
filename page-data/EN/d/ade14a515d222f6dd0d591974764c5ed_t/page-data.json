Snoring may not only be a nuisance for others but also mean trouble for the one snoring as 75% people who snore also suffer from obstructive sleep apnea. This may lead towards developing heart diseases. Other times it may be happening simply because of poor lifestyle choices or bad habits which will be discussed further. It occurs more frequently in men and worsens with age. The matter may be disregarded if you are an occasional snorer but if you are habitual you not only disturb the sleep pattern of those around you but may also need medical assistance as it could be an indication for some underlying health issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Causes of snoring?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the flow of air during breathing is physically obstructed in the mouth or nose, it results in snoring. There are several reasons which may cause obstruction of air flow:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1. Obstructed nasal airways&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some people may be the occasional snorers when their allergies act up and obstruct their air ways or when they suffer from sinus infection. Sometimes deformities in the nose may lead to the blockage of nasal passages and the air may not be able to pass freely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2. Poor muscle tone in tongue and throat:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The muscles of throat and tongue may become too relaxed and consequently collapse in the airway. This could happen if a person consumes a lot of alcohol, use sleeping pills or simply hitting the sick after utter exhaustion. The muscles tend to become more and more relaxed with age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3. Heavy throat tissue:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being overweight does not help to curb snoring as it directly translates to bulky throat tissue which means obstructed air passage. Also children with large tonsils may end up snoring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4. Long uvula or soft palate:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Long uvula or the soft tissue that is dangling from the back of the mouth if bigger in size can narrow the opening from nose to mouth which means air passage is not clear. This could only mean snoring as air making its way through it makes it bump and vibrate and result in snoring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Natural remedies to check snoring:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are available some over the counter medication that may claim to aid in your snoring but they have no authentic scientific research backing them. Instead of going for medication you can try free of cost natural remedies to fix you or your loved one’s snoring problem:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-479.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;When you rest on your back and sleep in that position your muscles in tongue and soft palate fall back on your throat resulting in vibrating sounds as you breathe. This could be easily addressed by sleeping on your side. If you are not in the habit of sleeping to one side you could buy a “body pillow” which is a full length pillow to help you keep on resting to one side. You could also tape tennis ball to the back of your pajamas to avoid sleeping on your back. Many people stop snoring only by adjusting their sleeping position. You may also set your pillows in a way that you recline a bit while sleeping. This helps with positioning your nasal passageways to remain open although sleeping in this position for long may be uncomfortable for your neck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-480.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;As already established in the causes, if you are overweight you might have a bulky throat tissue which may obstruct the air passageways of nose and mouth. You could also tell if you did not used to snore and after gaining weight you have complains of snoring. It is actually a possibility that due to excess fat around your neck your throat diameter may decrease resulting in obstruction of air passage resulting in snoring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-481.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Alcohol or any sedatives result in reduction of resting tone of the muscles at the back of the throat which means they will lose their posture and interfere with breathing which triggers snoring. It is common knowledge that alcohol may even cause those individuals to snore who previously had no issue of snoring in their sleep. It is highly recommended to avoid alcohol if you already have complains of snoring because it will not only make you snore but also makes you keep getting up during the night leading to a restless sleep. If you cannot completely avoid it drink it five hours before you go to bed.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-482.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;We cannot stress enough the fact that the major reason for snoring are restricted air passageways. It is akin to a narrowed water hose which makes the water rush through its narrow diameter. Similarly air rushes through narrow passageways resulting in snoring. You could take a hot shower before sleeping as it helps with opening those nasal passageways. You could also opt for a steam therapy to open your blocked nasal passageways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-483.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Also known as good sleep hygiene which basically requires you to be sensible about the time you stay up and the time you go to bed. Being overtired and completely exhausted before hitting the sack may make your muscles lose their natural tension and slightly collapse triggering snoring. It is in fact similar to drinking alcohol before sleep as it has the same effect on the muscle tone as alcohol or sedatives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-484.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;You may not be aware of it but excessive dust particles in your room may act as irritants and may inflame your throat leading to snoring. There may be allergens in your pillow and your bed that may contribute towards throat infections. Allowing pets in the bedroom may be another source of irritants as they shed hair and dead skin cells which is collectively called dander. Inhaling animal dander may also lead to irritation of throat which may result in snoring. So if possible keep your pets out of the bedroom. Clean your pillows and change your bed sheets at least once a week. Also make an effort to clean the overhead ceiling fan once in a while to check the accumulation of dust particles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-485.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;It is generally very good for your health to stay well hydrated since we are more than 70% water! Besides that by having lots of fluids we will make sure our secretions from our soft palate and nose do not become too sticky. If we are dehydrated such secretions will be in our throat like a sticky residue and make snoring worse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-486.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;You could use mouth appliances if your doctor may think of it as the best possible solution. These are like sports mouth guard which supports the jaw in a forward position to keep the upper airways open and clear. It is portable and easy to use and will drastically improve your quality of life. You will sleep better and feel sharper throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Health risks associated with snoring:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Snoring may be brushed under the carpet as something harmless and considered something natural. However in reality it may be your body’s way of telling you of some impending health risk. First and foremost is the condition we have already mentioned: sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea causes many problems like:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1. Interruption in breathing: several times a night your oxygen supply might be completely cut off from few seconds to even a minute!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2. Keep waking up in night: You may not realize it or have any recollection but you wake up frequently in your sleep during the night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3. Unable to have a deep restorative sleep: Since your breathing may interfere and keep you from a sound and deep slumber you may become a light sleeper only. You may find it increasingly difficult to have a long, replenishing sleep for your body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4. Exertion on heart: Due to an effort involved in simple exhaling and inhaling puts an unnecessary pressure on your heart. It may lead to blood pressure and enlargement of heart. This directly translates into an imminent heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;5. General fatigue: The fact that you get a poor quality sleep each and every night means your body is deprived of the rest and recovery it needs to work on day to day basis. This results in drowsiness and a sensation of dragging yourself throughout the day. Being under rested is similar to being drunk and this makes you vulnerable to get involved in accident.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All images courtesy of Shutterstock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"A Simple and Natural Cure for Snoring Not Many Know About This","description":"Health risks and natural remedies to snoring"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/d/ade14a515d222f6dd0d591974764c5ed_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/d/b022182c3b2497566cc7e4c314f861cd_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"50 Amazing Bitcoin Facts You Must Know Before Buying One"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/d/a39617679a63da85581a439d4291b3dd_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"8 Symptoms of Hidden Depression That Everyone Can Experience"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
