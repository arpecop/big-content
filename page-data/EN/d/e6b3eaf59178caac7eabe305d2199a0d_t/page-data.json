They might weave a wonderful picture together but that is just limited to silver screen and once off-screen these celebrity co-stars shared nothing in common. Following are few such celebrity co-stars who did end up together despite hating the fact that they have to work with each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Josh Hartnett and Harrison Ford&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1990.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Hollywood Homicide is one of the few unsuccessful films of Harrison Ford, where he played a police officer co-starring with Josh Hartnett who is his younger cop buddy. Ford takes Hartnett under his experienced service in the police department and makes him learn the ropes and how to tackle cases. One of the reasons why the film fared so badly may be attributed to the almost negligible chemistry between the two.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both the actors developed such strong differences that they even did not made eye contact to each other while shooting a scene for the film. It is rumored that Ford referred to the young actor as a “punk” while Hartnett not holding back called him “an old fart”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Shia Labeouf and Tom Hardy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1991.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikimedia &lt;p&gt;Shia Labeouf is known in the media for his many eccentric antics and has made headlines for the wrong reasons. This time it was while co-starring with Tom Hardy in the well-received movie Lawless. Both the actors while shooting for a scene got into an argument which escalated to an all-out physical altercation. The people on set had to intervene and restrain both to stop the fight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later on Tom Hardy while talking about the quarrel said that Labeouf somehow managed to knock him out. This could be taken as sarcasm from Tom Hardy given the difference between both stars in physical strength.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;3. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1992.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikimedia &lt;p&gt;Although both the actors gave the audience a very thrilling and tempting ride on-screen but in real life there is little to no understanding between them. The reason which surfaced for this zero interest towards each other is because of the extremely demanding behavior of Dakota Johnson while on the set.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the staff and co-star Jamie Dorman she was feigning a lot of attitude and making mountain out of a mole hill. The diva act of Johnson got so much on everybody’s nerves that the film producer had to call her mother and tell her to make her daughter lose the act of being an all-important person. Apparently Jamie Dornan still finds her unbearable as he did not contacted her after the shooting wrapped up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1993.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikimedia &lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that anyone who has seen the X-Files could absolutely tell that the couple, Mulder and Scully had great chemistry on-screen and might be closer together in real life as well. Quite the contrary the iconic T.V duo had hard time bearing each other off-screen. It could be that 16 long hours of shooting a day again and again with same person might have stressed them out or it could be that they actually hated each other’s guts. Whatever the case maybe they did not had good words to say about each other as Duchovny referred to Anderson as a “perfectionist” and he without mincing his words called her a “pain in the arse”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1994.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikimedia     &lt;p&gt;The on-screen romance in The Notebook released in 2007 was so powerful and strong between Noah and Ally that people actually wished it to be a true story. However both the actors had such a falling out that Ryan Gosling actually tried to convince the directors to get someone else to co-star with him. He even made attempts to remove her from the set during breaks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"15 Famous Co-Stars Who Totally Hated Each Other","description":"There are often times a lot of chemistry between celebrities on-screen and their appearances together do enthrall the audience but in reality they have nothing in common."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/d/e6b3eaf59178caac7eabe305d2199a0d_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/d/e924e325c90ad5fce7907fcb98df167d_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Warning!
