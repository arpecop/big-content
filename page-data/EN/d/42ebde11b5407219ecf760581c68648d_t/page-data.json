You remember it all by your heart from the start till it ends one never forgets it. Since you have taken the pains to plan it out in the most best way possible making sure that everyone who joins you enjoy it to the fullest you do not want anything to go wrong. So today let’s explore some of the most memorable stories of some people which made it amusing and more worth remembering for them!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Angry mother in-law to deal with&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1134.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Mother in-laws can usually be the toughest person to deal with at times, especially if the daughter in-law to be is not their “type”. When Amy was planning the wedding her mother in-maw did not approve of anything since she just did not like her. Instead she started pointing out how everything was being done reflected “low-quality” and was not satisfied with anything. To make matters worst she was constantly comparing the wedding arrangement with that of her friend’s step-daughter’s wedding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the main day she spread false rumors about how the bride mistreated her by not inviting her to get ready with them although amidst all the drama the bride still had the nerve to invite mum in-law to come along with her! Also, she went around telling the guest that the wedding was very extravagant! Phew!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Oh, that Wasp!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1135.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;When a friend of mine was getting married she ensured that it was a “grand”. She was so happy and was trying to make everything possible for her wedding. The best part was that she invited almost everyone to the wedding. She even bought herself an awesome dress along with the best photographer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But just before the big day the worst thing happened which made it sad for her. She got stung by a wasp on the upper lip which made her face swell as well. On the wedding day she was the puffiest bride. A puffy face, puffy dress, rash due to allergic reaction as well as teary and swollen eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Doves won’t move&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1136.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;A couple wanted to end the ceremony by freeing some doves. But when the moment arrived instead of flying and disappearing in the to the sky the birds decided to stay glued to the floor. No matter how many times the husband tried to make the doves fly but they just did not move. The guests were having a good laugh until one of the doves climbed on the groom’s hand and he had to put it off. Many guests said that it is a sign of bad luck if the doves refuse to fly away. It all ended up being wrong. The couple is still married after twelve years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Same dress&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1137.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;When a bride chose a red evening dress for her wedding ceremony and she entered the hall she was shocked. This is because the registrar was also wearing the same dress as her. Lol&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. What’s in a name&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1138.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;So, when this girl’s sister got married the registrar asked him about whether he agrees to the marriage. He was in such a hurry that he replied that since its Ana he agrees to everything. But she said that her sister’s name is Karen. Talk about co-incidence!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Motivation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1139.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;While this couple was dating the girlfriend adored the eye lashes of her boyfriend. She had always asked him to put makeup but he always refused. So, when he proposed to her later she got all confused and could not find any words to say! He came up with this sudden offer which allowed her to put makeup on him and she said yes immediately!&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;7. Size matters&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1140.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Until the time came to exchange the rings the bride and the groom were happy. The bride’s ring was perfect but when she tried to slip the ring in his finger things turned a bit sour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ring was too small for his finger and the bride started to panic. In her last attempt she proved to be successful in slipping the ring in his third finger! Although the entire ordeal was captured by the photographer. I am sure anyone watching it must have had their share of laughter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. The little monsters&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1141.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;We often believe that only the adults have the power to ruin a wedding but in this case the little ones ended up doing the deed for the couple. In a particular wedding the children ended up creating quite a scene. When the guests were presented with champagne and kids were served the apple juice this particular “gang” of boys went around to have a sip from the drink of inattentive guests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also had to be told all the time to stay calm and sit down at one place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To add fury to the fire the kids went around bashing all the cameras since instead of hiring a professional photographer disposable camera were placed on the tables.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The kids had their time merry making while destroying it for the guests. The groom was just apologizing all the time and it was later discovered that the couple divorced! They say kids never lie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. What to do&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1142.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;At this particular wedding the wedding cards were sent to 200 people. But it was later found that twice as many guests appeared since they got to know from the word of mouth. When the bride walked down the aisle she was surprised to see the number of guests because the food to be served was for the limited number of guests they had invited. Since the receiving line was so long that many of the guests had to leave without the party Hmm smart people I must say!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Sissies can be nerve wrecking too!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1143.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;In this wedding the poor bride was constantly under attack from her prospective sister in law. During the entire wedding she had this disapproving look on her face and the worst part was that she went on to throw candy at her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not only that but two groomsmen were also slapped and the groom had to suffer a cheesecake attack in the eye! To make matters worse she even ended up ruining the dance for the couple. Now it has been six years since the bride and her sister in law have spoken.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. It’s time to cut the cake&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1144.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Now this is really funny. A couple was taking pictures in front of the cake and the aunt thought that it was time to serve it. She started to serve it and then the bride and groom burst out laughing!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Modelling&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1145.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;While getting their photography done the couple “Have you ever modelled?”. The bride replied “no” to which the photographer replied “I am asking about your husband”!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. The wrong wedding&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1146.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;A group of friends who had to attend their best friend’s wedding got late to the reception. AS they reached the hall the couple was being declared man and wife. Panicking they rushed to the front row and caused a bit of unease amongst the guests.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;The couple started to stare at them for being strangers. It was later found that the group of friends had landed at some one else’s wedding and their friends were next in line!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"13 Superb Wedding Stories That Newlyweds Will Never Forget","description":"So today let’s explore some of the most memorable stories of some people which made it amusing and more worth remembering for them."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/d/42ebde11b5407219ecf760581c68648d_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/d/473507690673d25e7668a8df3f920add_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Nice Guys Aren't Good Men — Know the Difference"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/d/3a2960b5d2b1949dd6a416062b760d8d_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"You Had Never Thought That Knowing Types of Addictions Could Be So Beneficial!"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
