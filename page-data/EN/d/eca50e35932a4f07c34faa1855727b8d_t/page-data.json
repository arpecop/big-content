Especially if they have to fulfill the roles of the husbands or the father, men have to be there for the family. All girls dream to have a prince charming in her life who shows that they care. It takes a lot to be expressive in love and actually show that they care rather than just saying it. All these pictures prove that when it comes to care men take it to the next level! The following is the compilation of ways in which the men are trying to show that they care in their little own cute ways. So here you go! Be ready for the dose of overloaded cuteness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;16. Windowsill&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-764.jpeg&quot;/&gt;diaforetiko &lt;p&gt;Having the desire to enjoy the view outside the windowsill in a different way this man made it all true for his woman. He tried to turn the windowsill in to a comfortable sitting place so that she can enjoy the view over tea, coffee or any time she wants to. Sounds too cute right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. Dresses&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-765.jpeg&quot;/&gt;diaforetiko &lt;p&gt;How many of us stand outside the closet staring at it in the morning in order to decide what to wear? Especially if you are a girl I am sure you would not be able to decide what to wear every morning because you think that you never have enough clothes. Well this man’s wife was one of those women who did not like shopping. I am sure she is one of those types who do not feel the pleasure after shopping! But for some of us shopping is a therapy right? So in order to help his wife Paul Brickman presented his wife 55,000 dresses so that she has a vast variety of dresses to wear. That’s really creative isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. Memories&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-766.jpeg&quot;/&gt;diaforetiko &lt;p&gt;We all love to cherish the good memories right? Often we want to keep them safe by having photography frames, or through any other means isn’t it? So this husband put more than 7,000 stickers which had memories of the couple on the wall of their bed room. That is an amazing way to show that he cares a lot about his girl!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Flowers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-767.jpeg&quot;/&gt;diaforetiko &lt;p&gt;One can always go against the rules and try doing something out of the box. This particular man made flowers out of paper and presented it in the form of bouquet to his wife. It ended up pretty decent and neat, similarly it looked really different, and elegant. I would just melt over my husband if he did this! Fans of paper art will definitely agree because these things look quite amazing then the normal ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. The scale&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-768.jpeg&quot;/&gt;diaforetiko &lt;p&gt;Looking at the weight machine and getting to know your increased weight bothers you right? My eating patterns get really affected if I even notice a slight increase in my weight increase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sad story. This man came up with a really amazing solution to the problem his wife was facing. And when I said amazing it really is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of having a scale of numbers he replaced it with adjectives describing beauty. The scale had words like gorgeous, luscious, and sexy, hot, cute, beautiful amongst few. I would like to give a round of applause to this man for solving the problem in such a creative way. Hats off to you Sir!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11.
