The thing is that some of those products are worthless. The only thing that such products create are the false expectations in ones mind. This article focuses on informing you about the uselessness of certain beauty products, which do not provide the results that they promise. Reading the points below will make you able to convince any girl regarding the ineffectiveness of the beauty products that they use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;17. Anti-aging shampoo&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-390.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Who would have ever thought that shampoos can be anti-aging as well? These shampoos promise you to strengthen and nourish your old hair. If you consider that grey hair is one of the signs of getting old, then there is nothing that we can do. The reason behind this is that no anti-aging shampoo can change the genes that you have. Having grey hair is a genetic thing; no cosmetic product can change it. On the other hand if you want your hair to be healthy and want to prevent them from getting dry and rough then there is only one solution to this problem i.e. consuming healthy food and taking good care of your hair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;16. BB cream, CC cream, DD cream&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-391.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;BB creams are blemish balms that were first invented and formulated by Japanese companies. These balms deal with balancing the facial color, smoothing and removing the scars and marks on face. Increasing popularity of this cream in European countries triggered the companies to introduces CC cream (color controlling cream) and DD cream (daily defense cream). The fact is that these creams are merely make up bases, which provide no protection, and the color controlling factor associated with such creams is temporary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. Lip scrub&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-392.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Every female is conscious when it comes to peeling lips. How would it look when a girl puts on a really sexy colored lipstick on her peeled lips? Girls after imagining the same thing, go to the cosmetic stores and buy lip scrub. This product is available in many different flavors, costing 5$ to 20$. The reality is quite straightforward. Human lips are sensitive. Rubbing a rough substance to remove dry skin from your lips might worsen the condition and cause injury at the end. A far better option is to visit a doctor and solve the matter on time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. Lotions and creams for stretch marks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-393.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Stretch marks on various parts of body is what worries many of females nowadays. The rising need of removal and prevention of such marks increases their demand. We do not want to discourage any female, but these lotions are as useless as a goalkeeper when Christiano Ronaldo strikes. Stretch marks removal requires cosmetic surgery, only lotions and creams cannot help. For prevention, one must hydrate his skin by applying moisturizing lotions and drinking adequate water.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Anti-aging cream&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-394.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Anti-aging creams cannot remove the wrinkles that you have on your face. Doctors and surgeons will tell you that cosmetic surgery is the only solution. On the other hand, if these creams provide proper hydration then it might help wrinkles from happening. But only prevention is possible (to some extent), not removal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. 2 in 1 shampoo&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-395.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;There are manufacturers who claim that their shampoo has 2 in 1 features. It contains shampoo and hair conditioner as well. But the truth is that both such things cannot exist mutually. The head and hair washing shampoos have low alkaline content, while the balm is greasy and nourishes the hair. If you go deep into its chemistry, you will know that the 2 in 1 shampoos that you are using are nothing but just an ordinary shampoo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Hair mask&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-396.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;If you purchase a hair care set, you will find three products which contain a shampoo, a conditioner and a hair mask. Reading the prescription on the hair mask will let you know that the company tells you to use it only twice or thrice a week. Just because it contains concentrated substances that can actually damage your hair. Going into the detailed chemistry will tell you that the conditioner contains approximately the same chemicals in diluted form. A proper guidance will be to either purchase a set of shampoo and conditioner or a set of shampoo and hair mask. The choice is yours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Body lotions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-397.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The body lotions promise to keep your skin protected and heal the adverse effects on it. The matter of fact is that the lotions are not the ultimate solution to your problem. The best solution that you can get is a cosmetic surgery. The manufacturers in cream and lotion industry always focus on producing several creams for different parts of the body; which means that the female customers would buy more creams and be fooled. The thing that you need to do is to keep your skin hydrated and moisturized, in order to prevent marks and scars on your body.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;9. Conditioners with hair dye&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-398.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The hair dye contains vigorous chemicals that alter and destroys your hair structure. Applying a conditioner to prevent the damage is quite useless. Buying a conditioner with a vigorous substance that damages your hair is not of value, because the hair get damaged anyway. One should take proper care of hair after dyeing and stop buying useless conditioning products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Eye creams&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-399.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Cream manufacturers sell eye creams and tell you that this cream will help you overcome the dark spot problem that you face. The fact is that these creams are not different from any other ordinary facial cream. The companies produce such creams in small packing to earn more profit by labelling an ordinary cream as eye cream. The best that you can do is to use any facial cream that is not greasy and is without fragrance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Foot masks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-400.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The foot masks are gaining more are more popularity in the massage parlors. The reason behind this is that the companies ask you to try this masks because the skin on your feet is thicker than the skin on other parts of your body. The reality is quite obvious. Thicker skin does not mean that your feet are resistant to other ordinary body moisturizers. Start using the same body moisturizer on your feet which you use on your body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Night creams&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-401.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Hauschka (of Dr. Hauschka Skin Care) the skin itself produces oil and expels the impurities during the night. This process is continuous and needs no enhancement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After regular application of night creams, the skin stops producing the oily liquids and signals the sebaceous glands that it is getting an external help from an agent. This is turn stops the oil generation and makes your skin dependent. As a result, the skin becomes drier. The only exception is the application of retinol, but Dr. Hauschka still prefers keeping your skin as it is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Chap Sticks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-402.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The chap sticks application makes you addictive, the only reason is non other than alcohol. Chap stick contains alcohol which makes you apply it on your lips regularly, and is of no use. Doctors suggest applying lips balm that contains natural ingredients. Some lips have in-built feature of balancing the moisture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Breast enhancement creams&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-403.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The society and pornographic movies have created an expectation among the females that the larger the breast, the more pretty and attractive they look. This false assumption then provokes them to spend hundreds of dollars on buying breast enhancing creams. These creams are bogus and bring nothing but disappointment. You must stay in the natural shape that the nature gave you. Even now if you want enhancement in size, then go to a surgeon for surgery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Anti-Dandruff shampoos&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-404.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;According to hairstylist Hikari Tezuka, dandruff shampoos cause your skin to became drier. If you think that you are going through psoriasis or eczema, then visit your doctor and let him know what suits you the best.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another method is the old-fashioned technique of brushing your hair a hundred times before taking bath, by a brush. A good bath after brushing your hair several times will help in washing away the previous scalp and hence reducing the dandruff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Shaving creams&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-405.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Before the shower gel, people used to use shaving cream before shaving the unwanted hair; just to make them smooth enough. Nowadays, even after the introduction of shower gel, people use shaving creams. Chemists say that the shower gels contain high contents of glycerin, which doubles the effect of soup and creams. So it is better to throw away the unnecessary shaving creams away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Vitamin E capsules&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-406.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com     &lt;p&gt;Some people use vitamin E capsules to provide better nourishment to their skin. The fact is that when these pills are exposed to light, the chemicals in it breakdown. In addition, the preservatives in the pills might cause inflammation. Doctors suggest using creams that contain vitamin E, that form of vitamin E never breaks down in light.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"17 Useless Beauty Products We Waste Our MONEY On.","description":"Want to reduce the load of your make-up kit?
