Do you consider yourself as the genius of well due to this? If yes, then sorry to disappoint you but your school grades are not in any way a reflection of your intelligence. Studies mainly focus on rote learning, while the inner intelligence can be attributed to your ability to solve some of the most difficult questions that have been devised to challenge people. These questions will apparently be very short and sweet, but once you sit to actually decipher their answer, you will realize that you have to put a lot of mental effort to prove your smartness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s have a look at some of these questions that should be answered within 30 seconds by real smart people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What number do you see?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-9.png&quot;/&gt;onsizzle &lt;p&gt;In this image, despite the dark background, there is a number hidden that only a genius and a person with excellent eyesight can spot. Don’t forget to calculate the number of seconds that took you to solve this!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Identify the letter ‘H’&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-942.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Brace yourself as your clock will be ticking out. To prove your IQ level, you have to spot the letter ‘H’ within this electronic grid of numbers. Sounds easy, isn’t it? Well, you have to do this only in 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Connecting the Dots&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-943.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Were you efficient enough to connect these four dots with four straight lines? You must have tried it by redrawing the dots and that would have been a futile attempt. What many people tend to forget while solving this is that a line can exceed beyond the dots as well. Disappointed that you wasted you time joining the dots somehow and didn’t let your line exceed the dots?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Spot the number of black dots&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-944.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Scrutinize this image carefully and identify the number of black dots that lie within this image. There is a considerable chance that you are not going to get it right. The reason being not your low intelligence level but because we as humans, tend to focus on a specific area of an image while the total of black dots that are in this image are spread throughput the figure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Panda hunting&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Observe this picture for some time. Inside the picture, there is a hidden panda, and if you are a super smart then only you could spot it within your 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Identify the fastest flowing tap&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-945.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;If your answer regarding this image is anything but tap number 1, then you are an extremely intelligent person, full of creativity and a desire to accept challenges. However, none of these three taps is the right answer. The correct answer is tap number 1. But this doesn’t mean that you do not have a good IQ.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Which tank will be filled first?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image.jpg&quot;/&gt;amazonaws &lt;p&gt;Your innate IQ level will not be enough to accept this challenge. You would require the help of a physics genius to identify correctly that tank 3 and 4 will be filled first and simultaneously. This is a tricky one; I agree!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A tricky riddle&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Something that begins and ends with the letter ‘T’. Now you might be rummaging in your head with all the vocabulary words that you have ever heard in your life. Although it’s not very much confusing, some even the brightest people can fail to answer correctly; i.e. a “teapot”.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;How many cubes?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-946.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;You have to tell the number of cubes that have been used to get this entire structure completed. A lot of you will fail to get it right because you will ignore to count the cubes that are not visible, but do exist to support the entire structure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Correct the mistake&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-947.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Read this image again and again and you will still not catch the mistake. This is because we are so habitual of reading this simple phrase that we always overlook the fact that there are two ‘the’ in the text written.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tell the number of holes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-948.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;This one is super tough isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Readjust the matchsticks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-949.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;This question requires more creativity rather than logic. If you are astute enough, you would be able to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Identify the number of triangles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-950.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;All you have to do is see whether you are mentally competent enough to identify the number of triangles in this simple figure, before your time runs out?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Where is the SpongeBob?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-951.jpeg&quot;/&gt;https://www.talepicker.com &lt;p&gt;Minion; our favorite little animated creature. Let’s see if you can spot SpongeBob whose hiding amidst these minions in the above image. Don’t get over confident if you spot him, because even you concur that this was the easiest one!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Find the smallest Rhombus&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-952.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;This one is real confusing. It’s not solely about evaluating you IQ level, but this one calls for assessing you on the basis of your concentration skills. Many people get dizzy while scrutinizing the image and their time runs out. So if you are bale to answer this one correctly within the time frame, then pat yourself on the back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Figure out the number of animals&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-953.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Last, but not the least, let’s challenge you with one of the toughest questions. In total there are a total of 16 animals. You had to use a little bit of more logic to answer this one. One has to carefully identify the color patterns in order to discern that all of the pictures are of different animals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, were you able to answer all these questions correctly and within the time limit? If yes, then hats off to you! You have finally discovered something new about yourself and it deserves a round of applause since you are a real genius and count within the 2-3 percent of the entire population. Nonetheless, if you failed to solve these challenges, then there no need to feel despondent. Your failure hasn’t proved that you are not intelligent. You are still smart but you stand with the majority of people who hold an average IQ level.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Do not underestimate yourself and continue to seek such challenges enthusiastically. For a bit of fun, you can challenge your acquaintances with these questions and burst their bubble if they think they are too smart.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"ONLY a GENIUS CAN SOLVE THESE in 30s!
