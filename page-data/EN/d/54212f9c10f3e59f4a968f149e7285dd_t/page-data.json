Researchers and scientists in Budapest studied the influence of lack of solar light on a fetus. The season and month that a person is born in has influence on the happiness and good mood hormones, dopamine and serotonin. Moreover, scholars at Alicante University in Spain found the link between the birth month and nature to 27 chronic diseases and conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scroll down to find out what your birth month says about your personality and why is it like that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2079.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;January seems depressing and lazy, with the sun hardly present and the temperatures falling down to the freezing points in most of the country. This is why people born in the first month of the year are liable to depressed mood and suppression. But, that’s not the only thing the month says about them. January babies are less irritable and choleric. They have more tolerance levels than others and know how to swallow their anger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People who have birthdays in January usually face gastric ulcers, constipation, loin pains in men, cardiac attacks, migraine, and menopause problems (women). But, don’t be alarmed, it’s not a must. It’s only the chances that are slightly higher. Keyword: slightly.

In addition to that there are higher risks of heart attacks in men and thrombosis (formation of blood clots in vessels) in women. They should also be aware of osteoarthritis, a chronic condition of the joints. It transpires when the tendon amid joints disrupts down causing discomfort, pain and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People born in February are more likely to become artists or performers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2081.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;March is when spring blooms. Flowers begin to grow and birds come chirping out of their nests. The trees sing songs of bliss and butterflies dance around the fields. It’s the season of colors and joy.

The sun has become a warm yellow inferno. Everything’s bright and positive. Including the mood of people born in June. Yet still, people who are born in June are usually cyclothymic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the sun being bright and yellow in June people born in this month are hit by the blues more than those born in December. It’s the summertime sadness (what up Lana Del reference). In some rare cases this can grow into psychological disorders, such as a maniacal depressive psychosis or a bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;But, here’s the good news.

All that solar light has influenced the mood of people born in July making them more optimist. They tend to look at the sunny side. Focusing on the bright areas of life is part of their nature. They bring energy into conversation and there’s hardly a dull moment when around them.

Everything is bright and perky. You can expect the same from the personality of people born in August. When you think of summer you think of bright hues. You think of cheerfulness. Everyone’s lively and happy because it’s the season of ice creams and green trees and picnics. This is the kind of vibe people born in August give off.

It’s time to exchange your flip flops for shoes and walk on the crunchy orange leaves on the ground. Perfect weather for a walk in the wind, with the sun rays still making their way down giving a perfect golden ambience. This sun is the reason why people born in September are less likely to go through bipolar disorder or depression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tumors in women born in September are more likely. Men are more susceptible to asthma. Osteoporosis and thyroid gland problems are seen in both as well. Though, chronic diseases are not really common.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People born in September are born to reach the sky. They are may become high achieving students or sportsmen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2088.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;As autumn carries on, the personality of people born in October is also affected.

People born in the last month of the year are usually suppressed like the sun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The season’s effect on people born in December is that men are disposed to depression, cataracts and heart issues. Women are likely to have asthma, thrombosis, and chronic bronchitis.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;People born in December will excel as dentists or messiahs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Scientists Prove: How the Month You Were Born Affects Your Personality","description":"Believe it or not but just like planets and stars the amount of sunlight also has effects on our personality.
