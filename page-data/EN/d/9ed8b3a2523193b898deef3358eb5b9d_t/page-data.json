With the onset of technology and social media and the way they have taken over our lives, taking photographs has become a mundane affair. Anyone can whip out their smartphone and take high definition pictures of themselves and the others around them. In barely a few decades, cameras have evolved so quickly that, somewhere along the way, it seems that we have lost the romanticism of it all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bulky, stocky cameras and sombre black-and-white portraits – that era has long passed. However, it is fascinating to imagine that, just a hundred years ago, the young generation of those bygone times would pose in front of the camera lens just like the young generation of today’s times do. Minus the pouts, of course. So, take a trip down memory lane and scroll through these nostalgic images from nations around the globe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;23.
