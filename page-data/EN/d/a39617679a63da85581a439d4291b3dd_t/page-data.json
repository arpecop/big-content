Technology has turned the tables and every day finishes with a blink of an eye. Everywhere you see people are in a rush and even the seasons are hasty. This speeding up of life has its negative effects on humans. People are not happy and are always in want for more or more. Either they are crying for the less they have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Depression is eating up half of the world’s population. It is a serious disease that shows various signs and symptoms. These indicators can be confused with the usual fatigue one has. But there are some variant signs that everybody can notice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-86.gif&quot;/&gt;@GIPHY &lt;p&gt;We have compiled 8 sign of depression that can help you identify depression in someone you love so that you can help them before something tragic happens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1.       They have a philosophical reason towards life&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-87.gif&quot;/&gt;@GIPHY &lt;p&gt;An important sign that you can notice in a depressed person would be their negative attitude towards life. They will always be blaming their failures on life and the surroundings around them rather than stepping up and taking the charge of their defaults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can hear them saying “Why is this happening to me?” or “Nothing makes sense to me!” They never take the blame for their fails and you can always find them with an illogical philosophy towards life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2.       Let’s skip this and sleep&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-88.gif&quot;/&gt;@GIPHY &lt;p&gt;Depressed people tend to give up on plans. They cancel meetings and parties. They would rather stay at home alone and unhappy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are so overwhelmed by sadness that they tend to stay away from sunshine and rainbow. This is a strong point to judge in a person who is suffering from depression and sadness.  They find convincing excuses to bail out on parties and events important for their friends and family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3.       They have a plastic poker face&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-89.gif&quot;/&gt;@GIPHY &lt;p&gt;Did you notice how dull they are now? They don’t react to your jokes that once created a big smile on their face. They have stopped teasing you or making fun of you. They don’t even give a reply when they are insulted themselves. People who are depressed will hide their laughs and smile behind a poker face. This usually happens when something terrible happens to them or a death of a loved one has affected them. They have lost their ability to express.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4.       I am sick&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-90.gif&quot;/&gt;@GIPHY &lt;p&gt;The people who suffer from depression are always finding reasons to be sick. They always complain about having a headache, pain in the body parts such as back and legs or sometimes the pain is so trivial such as a toothache. They might act to be sick around you, but in general, they are okay. The doctor’s reports are clear, and they are fit as a fiddle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This all might seem a little off the track, but these are alarming signs of anxiety and stress.  They are taking too much tension and that is resulting them to think psychosomatically.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5.       Obsession with trivial things&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-91.gif&quot;/&gt;@GIPHY &lt;p&gt;In a state of depression, one might obsess over things. They think they are finding answers to it while they are just beating around the bush and not getting to the end.  You can find them saying they will start a new project or do something in their lives, but they never begin taking the charge. Sometimes they just repeat similar things over and over again, but they never finish it up. They well themselves up in a cocoon of illusion, trying to think that they have something important to do and they are really busy but in reality, they are just idle.  Obsession can lead them to lose their loved ones. People will start to run away from them and their dark clouds&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;6.       Messed up home, messed up self, Messed up life&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-92.gif&quot;/&gt;@GIPHY &lt;p&gt;Depressed people are so absorbed in themselves that they rarely think about what is happening around the world.  They even stop thinking about their appearances and dress up without anything in particular in mind. They are always messy and don’t care what others might think of them. Once they were all about trendy and chick styles but now they have given up on everything they loved. Their house is messy, leftover pizza spoils on the couch. Their clothes fall at their feet when they open their wardrobe. And when was the last time they had a bath? Sadness engulfs them. It is eating their soul.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7.       Let is loose or work it up&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-93.gif&quot;/&gt;@GIPHY &lt;p&gt;Another alarming signal that you can notice in someone who is suffering from depression is that they might do the opposite of what they usually do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If they were lazy before, then they might have become a workaholic. Or if they were obsessed with their work, now they have turned into a lazy being. Either you find them working late at night or just sitting on the couch eating fatting things like chocolates, milkshakes and who can forget the ice creams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are hiding their sadness behind this act. They are anxious and tend to do the opposite of what they were before. They are trying to make sense of the world they are in by burying the sadness away.  The dull posture and stoop shoulders are indicators too that they are really unhappy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8.       They are hiding behind a mask of overjoy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-94.gif&quot;/&gt;@GIPHY &lt;p&gt;This is a major sign to look in a person who is having a phase of depression. They tend to hide behind a fake smile and are always over enthusiastic about petty things. They try to show the world that they are happy and content with their lives but in reality, they are suffering from sadness and loneliness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can see them laughing hard at jokes and they will act as they are the most carefree person in the world. They would avoid being serious around important talks and will crack jokes when confronted. You can only feel their real self in long talks they might have with a person they trust. Being happy is just an acting the real darkness lies behind that funny smile of yours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If someone you love has these eight pointers of depression or you might think you are suffering from depression yourself. Here are some solutions that might help you to overcome the hardships of misery and depression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is okay to say that you are depressed. People are fighting this phenomenon for many years. You are not alone. There are people who might help you and they are professionals at solving the misery and anxiety you are facing. Don’t treat depression as merely a phase that will move on with time. It never does but instead, it feeds on you and make you miserable and your friends too. Get professional help from a physiatrist. They will help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you think your friend is suffering from depression, try to talk to them. Ask them what hurts and why. They might be reluctant at first to tell you because they are ashamed to admit the facts of it. But in reality, all they need is a shoulder to cry on. Be that support to them. Be their shoulder to cry on. And if they still stop you and don’t tell anything then leave them for a while on their own. But always observe them and keep a critical eye on them. They might hurt themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t treat them as if their depression will vanish if they smile more or cheer up. Depression cannot be cured by a walk in the park. Don’t taunt them or use words as “Stop it” or “Cheer up buddy. It’s nothing”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Try to clean up their messed up life. Don’t leave them alone. Depression doesn’t only affect the brain it weakness up the whole body. Try to do their chores and clean up their house. This will help them straighten up their life and look at a new point of view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t stress them about something they don’t want to do. Don’t push them to do things they hate. This might crack them up or worse they can hurt themselves if you push them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Try to distance yourself from depressed people. Depression is contagious. It can affect you too.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Try to tell them you love them. Express your love to them more than necessary. Tell them the world is still a better place to live. They will understand that they are not alone to face the struggles, someone they love is always by their side. A caring post on Facebook or a happy picture on Instagram will make their day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-95.gif&quot;/&gt;@GIPHY   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"8 Symptoms of Hidden Depression That Everyone Can Experience","description":"He seemed fine then why did he kill himself?
