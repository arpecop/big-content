Two persons — Nasrullah and Tufail – witnessed this act,” said the initial report known as the First Information Report or FIR. According to the local police in charge Station House Officer Sarfaraz Anjum, the police took the teen in custody only after medical tests revealed that the young boy had sexually assaulted the late hen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1105.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;“Hussain has also confessed to his crime. The boy said he did it out of sexual frustration,” the police officer told local media outlets. According to Hafizabad police officials the results of the DNA swabs were still awaited. The authorities said that the suspect had been taken into police custody.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;As per Pakistani law intercourse with animals is illegal and punishable with a fine coupled with a long and excruciating prison sentence. According to section 377 of the Penal code “&lt;em&gt;Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than two years nor more than ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such crimes of passion are not new in Pakistan. Pakistan tops the list of countries where people search for gay and also animal porn. In deeply conservative Pakistan as in neighboring Afghanistan mingling freely with women is often not possible and many people are known to vent out their frustrations in other more creative ways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Afghanistan this has been institutionalized as the practice of &lt;em&gt;Bacha Bazi&lt;/em&gt; in which young teenage boys are kept as sex slaves by rich older men typically tribal and political leaders and local Afghan warlords are known to keep such harems full of young boys who dance dance and provide companionship until they grow up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Pakistan especially in rural areas fornication with various domestic animals is not unknown and animals such as donkeys, cats, dogs and even chicken have been molested by both young and old men alike due to the fact that premarital and extra marital relations between men and women are not only difficult due to segregation but are also dangerous if the people involved are discovered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus unable to have relations with the opposite sex frustrated men of all ages are known to vent out their urges via animal porn and real sex with animals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year six men were accused of gang raping a donkey after the family which owned the animal refused to sell their beloved animal to the accused. The six men then subsequently had their way with the poor animal before taking the donkey away at gunpoint in the district of Sahiwal also in the Punjab province of Pakistan which is the country’s largest province and home to more than 110 million of its 207 million people. The police were not interested in pursuing the case and the matter eventually died down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Law enforcement agencies are also known to be uninterested in sex crimes. Bestiality as horrifying as it is not a serious concern for Pakistani police who have for years been overwhelmed as the underfunded over stretched police officials try to deal with terrorism, sectarian violence and crime which has spiraled out of control crime in the country.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;According to a senior Punjab Police official who insisted on anonymity because he was not allowed to speak publically “The country is racked with so many different problems we are overburdened and chronically underfunded and have to deal with such serious law and order issues that we simply tend to ignore sex crimes as long as a person does not for himself on a another human we all tend to turn a blind eye.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Boy, 14, Arrested After a Neighbour Accused Him of Raping His Pet Chicken to Death","description":"The hen died while being sexually assaulted by Hussain"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/d/13d61d1766d82e155dd7cb5e1fc707bd_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/d/168397d8c77b31b84b9c6ed9cc00ce4d_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Why Divorce Runs in the Family - the Answer May Be Genetics"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/d/0ad5a896a89c57a6ba05d5000640935d_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"We Remain Stuck at the Mental Age Where We Received the Least Love"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
