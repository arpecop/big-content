They involve such an intricate balance of love, understanding, distancing and perspective that at times you consider if there should be a new science field just for relationships (blame-o-logy?). But they never have to be that hard in fundamental principle. It is often passed by the wise that the only thing required to make a relationship work selfless commitment from one end at the very minimum. This evokes either a reciprocating action from the other side or still makes everything work out due to the gung-ho approach to loving your special other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And yet, low self-esteem can manifest itself in a variety of funny ways to be a spoilsport to your love life. This comes in addition to how on the other hand confidence can buff up the strength of a relationship. Here are 19 deal breaking ways diminishing self-esteem can be the undoing of your relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#1. Limiting the relationship&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2204-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The power of self-confidence is enveloping and uplifting. Besides helping you become a more successful and approachable person (not to mention loads lesser creepy!), faith in yourself only shows your partner your integrity and encourages them to hold more faith in you. If you ask for your wants and things you wish to avoid, the relationship grows less ambiguous and stronger!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#2. Frustratingly low self-esteem&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2204-2-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;With a self-esteem that seemingly seems to hang down in the dumps, your determination to please would be overwhelming on you and as a result, stress would inarguably conquer your mind. Stress as a byproduct would ride down the relationship as it sends you and it into burnout. So de-cluster the relationship with the crushing weight of your low self-esteem to send it on its way to prosperity and happiness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#3. Lack of confidence&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2204-3-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Often the greatest weakness to your relationship can become it’s the biggest strength if a focus on the right. So turn the frail lack of self-esteem away and hold on to the confidence because it leads directly to communication and greater bridging between the two people in a relationship. Allowing you both to open up and express yourself is the greatest gift confidence can allow you. So latch in into your life without any delay!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#4. Self-expression is vital!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2204-4-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Building on the point mentioned before, no relationship works without the key element of communication through self-expression, and yours are no exception. Learn to express your thoughts, feelings, ideas, and personality. Because one can only expect commitment from their special other if they wind commonalities and common ground; which would be hard to do without communication. You will also adapt to become far more tolerating to each other and can express thoughts openly enough to freely open yourself. This helps raise tolerance levels and helps in coming to healthy relational agreements, which are vital characteristics of a relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#5. People take you for granted&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2204-5-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;There is a reason lowly self-esteem leads to the undoing of a relationship. When a person lacks the firm belief that they deserve kindness and respect, they begin to convince people of the same and eventually end up being treated as such, even though the case would be much more different originally. Allowing people to make those abusive inroads into your personality mean that your tolerating difficulties are taken for granted and ends with your abuse being redoubled. The cyclical bummer isn’t it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#6. Do not put efforts or energy in the relationship&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2204-6-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The funny thing about self-esteem is that it is in relationships, it is often perceived as an investment in the form of self-respect. If a person wants and desires to be treated like a king or queen, they must play the part by being authoritative and demanding in their self-respect. To be taken seriously and considerably, the person must allow for the bridging of this respect towards them, which opens doors to make them respectful as well. Talk about two birds with one stone!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#7. Tone up the appeal with confidence&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2204-7-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;There is a reason that all the main brands use the element of marketing their products and services using flashy attraction and allure. This is usually only prominent when accompanied by confidence because that amplifies the qualities of a person through a multi-spectrum kaleidoscopic effect of their personality. Not to mention that confident people carry the most psychological sex appeal. So seeming more attractive to other may cause your partners to commit with you further into the relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#8. The sleazy side of low esteem&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2204-8-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Ever treat yourself like someone who is severely unattractive? It turns out the cause may lie in how you perceive yourself, and this not only affects the reality for you but everyone else as well. So much so that confidence was listed as one of the must-have attributes for any person to look good despite the consequences in a recent survey. Projecting neediness and desperation may not be the way to go after all!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#9. The pansy syndrome&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2204-9-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Every person wishes to hold a steadfast and headstrong character in a relationship, however, things do get quirky when one of them show cowardice in the lack of low self-esteem, which can even be infuriating at times as your partner is left to wonder their luck at ending up with such an emotional wreck. And yet this low self-esteem means you won’t ever fully open up to your partner about these fears and express the vulnerabilities. The problems would only deepen themselves over the long run.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;#10. The flipside to self-esteem is self-acceptance&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2204-10-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Regarding sociological traits, having a high self-esteem means having a good self-acceptance which allows you to be more open to embracing not just your strengths and weaknesses, but your partners as well, making you a true asset in the relationship. Your understanding that there are several tiers of acceptance even below perfection and the factor of opening up develops a natural bond in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#11. You have relational psychic powers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2204-11-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The best part of self-esteem is that whatever you believe begins to evoke as reality in your mind, and if your partner is perfect for you in your mind, you start to feel that way and treat them with more love accordingly. It turns out self-esteem is linked to self-worth and if you ever need a quick syringette of self-esteem, just go back in your mind to a time when you looked on point. It works.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#12. What you believe is what you perceive&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2204-12-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;It does not matter what you have been convincing yourself of, whether you are unattractive or unfunny etc. What if you have been lying to yourself this entire time? There is much to come out of psychological positivity and optimism here, and chances are you’re better than you think you so just think that way and you’re halfway there to improving your relationship. There isn’t need to veil your goods and focus on your bads. That is just bad press.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#13. In confidence, understandings are made&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2204-13-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The expression is the most important gift you can bring to the table in a relationship, and that means the ability to deliver emotions and feelings to the special other at will. When this goes both ways, there is a barge opening of understanding that helps you both get the most and best out of the relationship. So whether it is a desire to cuddle or the need for some me time, let your partner know. You would be doing wonders for your relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#14. Lessened drama&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2204-14-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Ever come across a guy who complains that his woman is too low maintenance? Well, it is usually the opposite case. If you are free in your mind about where you stand due to self-esteem and expressional opening up, there are no insecurities from you to know what you expect of your partner and thee relationship has lessened drama altogether!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#15. Lack of fun&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2204-15-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;What use our relationships if we don’t get any comfort or fun out of them right? If you are confident about yourself, what kind of person you are and where you stand, you have tapped into the brains part where you can enjoy yourself to the fullest and boundless too whether you are along or with your partner. The lightness of spirit and the jolly mood is contagious to your partner, and you end up shining up your relationships in the best (read: cheesiest) ways possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4 ways to buff up your self-esteem&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Bling up yourself&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2204-16-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;It is needless to say that sitting on your bum waiting for your life to change is highly unlikely. So get up and make it happen for yourself, by making yourself happening. Use jewelry if you’re a girl and accessories if you’re a guy to make sure that you are doing your ultimate best to feel great in your skin. Power to you!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Guarding&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2204-17-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;It is understandable if you have experienced childhood trauma to make you apprehensive of your surroundings, there is a way of progressive guarding that ensures you bypass this where necessary, without bearing down on anything important. For example, controlled guarding is a useful way where you open up to people in measured doses to ensure you can regain confidence effectively.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Resilience&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2204-18-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Another outright way to directly counter the sheer lack of self-esteem is to be outright resilient to these factors and walk with your head held high to accomplish whatever deed you intended to do but took place back by circumstances or a lack of self-confidence. Remember, you’re only as strong or weak as you think you are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Innate fear of intimacy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-27-9-2204-19-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock     &lt;p&gt;Many of us are naturally afraid to open up, and this holds back so many chances for us in life that can do us so much good. So the best course of action in such a circumstance is to establish emotional connections, so they seem as less foreign and fake as possible. It is the better option when compared to shutting down or backing out of emotional bonding.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"15 Make or Break Ways Your Self Esteem Affects Your Relationship","description":"This balance requires synergy between mates and equal footing in all aspects, most of which should exist in self-esteem."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/d/cbeafe767688bea4b9fc2978a8a9d35d_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/d/d01813b6ff1214487ef5f645b17d49dd_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"KFC Release Bath Bomb That Leaves You Smelling Like Fried Chicken"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/d/ca8023725ec7a826ee6ef174edb4ff9d_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Relationship Advises from People Who Have Been Married Forever"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
