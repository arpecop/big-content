Many like to go shopping, some workout, others drink, some smoke, while many of those who are too young, sleep. But how much is enough and where does one really draw the line? How are these supposed addictions kicked to the curb, well let’s find out?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the basics of by defining what ‘Addictions’ are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Addictions are anything that makes someone become dependent, crave, become habitual or fixated on something. Some have addictions of shopping, some at the ends of their hair, some bite their nails and peel the skin around their nails… we’re all a little weird and have weird addictions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While a ‘habit’ is something that is completely different, it is usually done by choice and can be stopped, that too successfully when the individual desires.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-167.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The thing about addictions is that it most definitely leads to problems that can be visible by the people that you interact with on a day-to-day basis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing, some addictions might be damaging to your bank account or your nail beds, others, such as substances; alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, cannabis, etc., all have a far more serious and injurious impact when it comes to your body and bank account.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The following are the most abused substances:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;a. Alcohol&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;b. Amphetamines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;c. Cannabis (Marijuana)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;d. Cocaine&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;e. Hallucinogens&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;f. Hallucinogens&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;g. Tobacco&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-168.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The thing I that, these are just the most harmful ones, there are far more dangerous that affect your health, wellbeing, and safety, each having a specialized treatment that psychologists, psychiatrists, and doctors work to help their patients overcome the dangerous addictions… Treatment plans range from one on one to group.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cause of addiction is not fully understood by those who are’ sober’, as there is a combination of emotional, mental, circumstantial and physical factors which impact. As an individual’s dependency converts to tolerance it becomes far more difficult to reverse the effects of the substance and abuse, and that is one of the reasons for relapse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-169.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;It is very startling that there is a large number of individuals who realize that they have a serious problem with a substance. They have become so accustomed to that routine of, popping a pill or taking a shot that they are no ignorant to the fact that they do it, incorporating in their nature, or so one could say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now it is highly important to know that now all addictions are the same or should be treated the same way as other treatments. The treatment plan ranges as does the contents of the treatment, no two are the same. For some, it might be the duration of a few weeks while others have gone through months, years and even decades of therapy and treatment, and should they relapse, it is a whole other plan of action of these individuals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-170.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Many treatment plans also help in assisting families that have been affected by substance addiction, as many are impacted emotionally, mentally and physically due to their loved one’s addiction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now in our observation, we found that Alcohol addiction is the most common addiction out there. It has ripped families apart and caused individuals to suffer. One might not realize it but many individuals of our society have this problem, for those who abuse substances, if there is a will, there is away… it just might not be the most appropriate or correct way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-171.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Alcohol abuse is one of those addictions that many people say that ‘it just happened’ or ‘I don’t drink that much to be addicted to it’, well that is how it starts and it ends up causing far more harm than that one is trying to suppress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It should be noted that no type of addiction should be concurred by one’s own self, there are community groups and those anonymous groups that help all battling whatever their vice or addiction might be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Signs and Symptoms of Substance Abuse:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-172.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;A symptom is something that other people or a professional such a doctor observes to the effect of something. When it comes to substance abuse and dependence, a professional or anyone with their limited knowledge of the subject will observe that this specific individual is noble to control the substance they use, even if the person themselves might not know they are dependent or addicted to the substance. It usually ends up causing massive cravings, which might disable them from recovering.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;a) The person is taking the substance and cannot stop, this is usually in the case of nicotine, drugs or alcohol&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;b) A sudden increase in appetite&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;c) Insomnia&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;d) Triggering of violence, trembling, seizures, hallucinations, and sweats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;e) It creates other health problems such as constant headaches and migraines, lug problems, hearing issues, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;f) Social or recreational sacrifices such as limiting your social hangouts to clubs and pubs that allows drinking and smoking as well as recreational drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;g) Taking risks when intoxicated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;h) Becoming highly secretive&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;i) Obsession&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;j) Denial of their addiction&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;k) Experiencing financial difficulties&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now it should be noted that it might not be so that these symptoms occur to those who abuse as well as the fact that some individuals might have these or related problems due to other issues.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;Causes of Addiction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-173.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Doctors have observed that during the repeated use of an addictive substance it causes the brain to experience a kind of please that causes the body to desire more This can range from any of the above-mentioned substances as well as others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now in scientific terms, our brain has neurons, which release neurotransmitters into the empty spaces between our nerve cells, called synapse, which sends electric impulses from one to the other cell, organ muscle, and the other tissues present in our body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When this happens many times, our tolerance increases as it increases the please hormones, causing the risk of addiction to increase greatly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Treatments for Addiction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-174.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The road to recovery for those who abuse substances is not easy, it’s a is a long difficult road but the destination is totally worth it. There are many treatment options but they mostly depend on the substance that is being used and abused as well as how the substance and the treatment affect the individuals who take them. Now the treatment can be for both inpatients and outpatients, it can occur as counselling which is a form of psychotherapy, self-help groups, as well as sponsors and medication that are provided by the doctors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Addiction Treatment Programs: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These usually focus on getting addicts sober and preventing them from relapsing. There are different kinds of sessions that take place, individual, group, family, etc. Now it depends on the severances of the addiction, the behaviours of the patients as well as the substances involved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Psychotherapy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This usually occurs on a face-to-face basis with the individual and or the family with the specialist that has taken the matter to hand. These specialists help with coping without the substance and help in creating positive results for the patient and their family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Self Help Groups: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These groups help patients in meeting other people who are stuck in a similar situation with the same problem, which usually has a positive outcome on the patients as they feel motivated as a group rather hand an individual. Moral support plays key importance in this technique. Some examples are Alcoholic Anonymous or Narcotic Anonymous. For your local help-groups, be sure to ask your community club or local hospital or clinic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Help with the Withdrawal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main aim is to help the patient remove the toxins from their body as safely and quickly as possible. Sometimes, there are other drugs, which are prescribed by the doctor to combat the effects and influence of the harmful drugs, which were previously being used. Remember, not all drugs are bad, that is if your doctor provides them to you. A doctor’s prescription I necessary to purchase the medical drugs being prescribed as they help in achieving the major objective of the abused substance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are 3 major kinds of drugs that people abuse as they are usually available in most states and countries over the counter:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-175.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;(i) &lt;strong&gt;Anti-depressants:&lt;/strong&gt; when in the withdrawal process, one might feel seizures, hypertension, headaches, restlessness, sweating as well as hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(ii) &lt;strong&gt;Stimulants:&lt;/strong&gt; These can include cocaine and other various amphetamines, which may cause the individual trying to quit experience feelings of anxiety, depression, severe mood swings, insomnia, low to mild levels of concentration and laziness. The treatment is mostly group therapy but should depression symptoms be observed, your doctor would provide mediation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(iii) &lt;strong&gt;Opioids:&lt;/strong&gt; these are prescribed drugs that are taken advantage of, they include painkiller like properties i.e., morphine, oxycodone, methadone, etc. They show their withdrawal effects through sweating, anxiety, stuffy or irritated nose, insomnia, hypertension, and diarrhoea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your doctor does not mention these, please, be sure to ask them about the side effects of withdrawal as well as the effects of the other medication should they give you any. One should always obtain a second opinion just to be on the safe side. For those with doctors and medical professionals within their circle, it is advised that you go to someone who does not have any links to you as there may be a clash of doctor-patient confidentiality and might cause tension between both the parties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Complications and problems that could arise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-176.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The following is a list of the various complications and problems that misuse arise with substance abuse as those who are addicted to drugs and substances have their life affected and impacted in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;Various diseases&lt;/strong&gt;: As one might fall unconscious or share apparatuses that might cause diseases one should first stop sharing the substances and seek help from family or a specialist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;b. &lt;strong&gt;Mental Health&lt;/strong&gt;: The abuse of substances leads to mental and emotional distraught which is caused by the imbalance of hormones in one’s body caused by the abuse of drugs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;c. &lt;strong&gt;Suicide&lt;/strong&gt;: Many individuals who use and abuse drugs end up having suicidal tendencies which are heightened, especially when they’re high, and sometimes fall prey to their own minds, putting an end to their lives.
