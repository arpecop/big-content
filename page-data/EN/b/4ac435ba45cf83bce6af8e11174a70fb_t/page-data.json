Creatures like flies, mosquitoes, and ants are found pretty much in every sort of property, be it a commercial building or residential one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A gnat is one such pesky little insect which causes a lot of inconveniences if you do not take care of it in a timely manner. Fortunately, there are some simple homemade remedies which can be utilized to get rid of these irksome creatures and stop them from returning to your home time and again. Read on to know more about them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Use Ammonia to Get Rid of Gnats in Kitchen Sinks &amp;amp; Drains&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1324.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikiHow &lt;p&gt;For gnats infesting your kitchen sink and drain, ammonia is a highly effective cure. Simply pour a small amount of ammonia into the sink. This should be enough to kill off all the gnats. One precaution to be taken is to avoid using the sink for the next few hours after using ammonia to kill the gnats. This is because the toxicity of ammonia can be harmful to humans as well; therefore, it should be left dilute for several hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, if the horrible smell of ammonia is too much for you and you do not fancy using it, then you can always put a couple of tablespoons of baking soda into your drain. Follow this up by pouring one cup of white vinegar into the drain. Either wash it down with hot water or let it sit for a few hours before running water from the tap again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Make a Gnat Trap Using Wine and Soap&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1325.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikiHow &lt;p&gt;In a small transparent container such as a shot glass or ink bottle, pour red wine until it is about three-quarters full. Add a drop or two of dish wash soap and stir lightly. Once done, you only have to leave this mixture unattended for a few minutes before swarms of gnats will be attracted to it. Gnats like to sit on the surface of the wine but the presence of dish wash soap in the wine will cause them to fall through and drown in the liquid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Place this mixture in small containers near infected areas in your home and the gnats will fall to their own demise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Make a Gnat Trap Using Apple Cider Vinegar&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1326.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikiHow &lt;p&gt;Take a used glass container such as a jam or pickle jar and fill it with apple cider vinegar. Make it a little more than half full. Punch small holes in the jar lid and secure it tightly in place. Next, you just have to place the container in areas of your home usually inhabited by gnats and sit back to enjoy the spectacle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just like red wine, gnats are highly attracted to the scent of apple cider vinegar. Having entered the jar through the holes, these gnats will be unable to escape through the same space and remain trapped. Once the jar is full of gnats, you can simply dispose of the annoying little creatures and breathe a sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If apple cider vinegar is not available, some other type will also be fine. If you are using normal white vinegar, be sure to add a couple of drops of dish wash soap to make it more attractive for the gnats. Also, you can leave some banana peel in the jar and the gnats will find its smell appealing and flock towards it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Pouring Bleach Into the Sink and Drain&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1327.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Intunition &lt;p&gt;Another way to get rid of gnats in sinks and drains is to use bleach. Take care not to use it undiluted under any circumstances. Dilute it with a little bit of water and pour it into the sink and drain. Make sure to wear adequate eye and mouth protection when you pour this liquid into the sink and drain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Eliminating the Gnatsâ€™ Food Sources&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1328.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Gnats feed largely on food leftovers and scraps lying out in the open. Just like prevention is better than cure, the best way to keep your home free from gnats is to eliminate their sources of food altogether. Therefore, clean your kitchen and dining areas on a regular basis and promptly dispose of cooking waste and food leftovers. Do not leave them lying around for long.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Also, store your food items in airtight containers within a lockable cabinet and/or refrigerator. Specifically, items like fruits, vegetables, juices, and meat should be kept in a fridge or freezer. This will stop them from becoming extra ripe and attracting gnats as a result. Furthermore, avoid leaving dirty dishes and plates in the kitchen sink. Even if they are to be washed later, then get rid of the food scraps on them and keep them partially submerged in water.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Always Keep Your Trashcans Covered and the Area Around Them Clean&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1329.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Webstaurant Store &lt;p&gt;One of the most common breeding grounds for flies, mosquitoes, and gnats is the amount of garbage often left lying around a trashcan instead of inside it. Also, if the garbage cans and dumpster outside or near your home are left uncovered, the gnats will easily breed and reproduce there. From then on, it will only be a matter of time before those gnats find their way into your home. So, keep those garbage drums covered at all times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, avoid keeping bags of trash inside the house for long periods of time. Especially do not keep them in your home overnight. Take those bags out every night. Apart from that, your indoor garbage containers and baskets should be cleaned on a regular basis. Make use of bleach to scrub and clean those baskets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Avoid Excess Watering of Plants In Your Home&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1330.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikiHow &lt;p&gt;Take care while watering the plants in your home because certain species of gnats like to hover close to over-watered plants. The plant soil with excess water can prove to be a convenient breeding ground for such types of gnats. So, keep an eye on the moisture level of the soil and make sure that an adequate drainage route is available for the plant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Cover Top/Bottom Slits in Your Doors and Windows&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1331.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikiHow &lt;p&gt;For starters, do not leave your doors and windows open any more than is absolutely necessary. Check all doors and windows for any cracks or peepholes and get them fixed. Apart from that, cover the top and bottom slits in the doors by attaching rubber padding. This will prevent insects from slipping into your home under doors and windows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Make a Homemade Gnat Spray&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1332.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikiHow &lt;p&gt;Prepare a highly effective gnat spray by mixing a few pinches of lemon-scented dish wash soap with water in a spray bottle. Spray handsome amounts of this liquid over your kitchen and bathroom sink, household plants, and any other spaces usually inhabited by gnats. Let the spray sit for some time. The gnats will be attracted by the lemon scent and will be killed off by the spray not long after that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Buy a Good Quality Insect Spray&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1333.jpeg&quot;/&gt;The Domestic Curator &lt;p&gt;Many insect sprays are available in the market.
