According to Medical News Today, cysts can appear on any organ of the body and are typically closed capsule or sac-like structures, which are filled with liquid, semisolid, or gaseous material and resemble a blister. Ovarian cysts form on the ovaries and are not a normal part of the tissue. It has a distinct membrane and is separated from nearby tissue – the outer (capsular) portion of a cyst is called the cyst wall. If the sac is filled with pus it is not a cyst; it is an abscess.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-86.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Most cysts are benign and are caused by blockages in the body’s natural drainage systems. It is relatively rare, but some ovarian cysts are malignant, or cancerous. We might have heard of people who go for a routine checkup but are instead told the horrifying news that there are cysts on their organs which have become malignant. This is one of the worst possible scenarios to imagine happening. And if that person is your loved one, it makes it all the worse. Losing somebody to cancer and hearing the doctors say that their death could have been prevented if the cancer had been detected earlier is truly heartbreaking. Cysts also pose dangerous risks in the case of rupture or torsion. To avoid this, we must educate ourselves and others about symptoms that can tell the presence of this disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Who are at risk of having Ovarian Cysts?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-87.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;According to the US Department of Health and Services’ Office on Women’s Health, ovarian cysts are common in women with regular periods. In fact, most women make at least one follicle or corpus luteum cyst every month. You may not be aware that you have a cyst unless there is a problem that causes the cyst to grow or if multiple cysts form. About 8% of premenopausal women develop large cysts that need treatment. Postmenopausal women with ovarian cysts are at higher risk for ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ovarian cysts 5 centimeters (cm) long or less are common during a woman’s reproductive years. Up to 18 percent of females will be diagnosed with an ovarian cyst or tumor at some time in their life, and a small percentage of them will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer. You can never be sure when a non-malignant cyst can turn into a malignant one, so it is always prudent to get regular checkups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Symptoms of Ovarian Cysts:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ovarian cysts can remain undetected for a long period of time because most of its symptoms are passed off as either a stomach ache or menstrual cramps. By the time people actually notice that something is wrong, it is often too late. You have a higher risk for an ovarian cyst if you have pelvic inflammatory disease, which is an infection of the female reproductive organs. That is why you need to read on below to ensure that you are aware of the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;10. Abdominal pain:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-88.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;We usually pass off abdominal pain as a common occurrence due to overeating or anxiety. Women going through their menstrual cycle also tend to have stomach bloating or cramps. A stomach pain related to ovarian cysts is different. It occurs mainly on the side where the side is and its cycle does not correspond with your periods. It can occur even when you are not menstruating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;9. Bloating:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-89.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;This is also a common occurrence when a woman is going through her menstrual cycle or due to having too much food. But as in the case of abdominal pain, bloating related to ovarian cysts does not only occur during your periods. If you regularly feel bloated, it is time to get checked by your physician.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;8. Feeling full&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-90.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;We all know how it feels when you have had too much pizza or cake. It is very common to feel full after eating food. But when you have an ovarian cyst, it can make your abdomen feel heavier than usual. You feel full even though you haven’t had a full meal and the feeling would not go away even after emptying your bowels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;7. Painful bowel movements&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-91.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;According to BeatsOfHealth, ovarian cysts can cause bowel movement complications. Because of how close the ovaries are to your bowels, any growth that develops in the ovaries can press against the bowels. This can then affect not only how much your bowels can hold, but also the ease with which its contents can move.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;You will experience this symptom if your cysts have transformed into large cysts. You may feel pain when trying to empty your bowels. You may also find it difficult to completely empty your bowels – the large cyst pressing against your bowels may affect the muscle contraction and relaxation process that is necessary for bowel movement- and thus increasing the need for you to visit the restroom more frequently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;6. Pelvic pain before or during the menstrual cycle&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-92.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Pelvic pain resulting from ovarian cysts can be persistent or intermittent. It may range from a dull, heavy sensation to a sudden, severe and sharp pain. It may also be triggered by any strenuous activity. However, when the pelvic pain is sharp and sudden, you have no choice but to seek immediate medical attention. This is because this type of pain is a common indication of ovarian cyst complications such as ovarian cyst rupture, ovarian torsion and infections that occur when a cyst bursts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;5. Painful intercourse&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-93.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Having pain while or after sex is never a good sign. It may be due to a number of causes and ovarian cysts are one of them. This pain may be due to pressure on the ovaries or due to excessive movement of the pelvic bone. Even though this pain may go away by itself after the deed is done, it is not wise to ignore it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;4. Spotting between periods&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-94.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Any unusual bleeding is always a cause for concern. Cysts usually cause abnormal uterine bleeding if they become large, twist, rupture, or bleed. According to Mayo Clinic, a cyst that ruptures can cause severe pain and internal bleeding. The larger the cyst, the greater the risk of rupture. Vigorous activity that affects the pelvis, such as vaginal intercourse, also increases the risk. It is always a good idea to go to your gynecologist if you have spotting that occurs in between your menstrual cycle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;3. Breast tenderness&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-95.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;According to HealthLine, Breast tenderness is when your breasts feel painful or tender to the touch. Breast swelling or changes in the breast’s consistency may accompany the condition. The pain can be mild or so severe that it impedes daily activities. Even though this symptom is most commonly related to pregnancy, ovarian cysts can also cause breast tenderness as they trigger fluctuations in the hormones estrogen and progesterone, which in turn, can cause changes in breast sensation. These fluctuations can also cause changes in the consistency of your breasts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;2. Nausea and vomiting&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-96.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;This is another symptom which is commonly associated with pregnancy or overeating. However, it can also denote the presence of ovarian cysts. Cysts that enlarge can cause the ovary to move, increasing the chance of painful twisting of your ovary (ovarian torsion). This causes an abrupt onset of severe pelvic pain, nausea and vomiting. When nausea is triggered by ovarian cysts it can last for a long period of time and you can vomit even on an empty stomach. You feel bile rising up in your throat and rush towards the bathroom. It is important to consult your doctor if you experience constant nausea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;1. Faintness or dizziness&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is quite a severe symptom of an ovarian cyst that requires immediate medical attention. Faintness or dizziness can indicate a ruptured cyst or an ovarian torsion. Both complications can have serious consequences if not treated early.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Therefore, it is of utmost importance that you visit your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms. If your doctor feels that you are at risk of ovarian cysts, or have a family history of them, he or she may continue to monitor you and ask for regular visits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Prevention:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sadly, you cannot prevent functional ovarian cysts if you are ovulating. If you get ovarian cysts often, your doctor may prescribe hormonal birth control to stop you from ovulating. This will help lower your risk of getting new cysts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Treatment:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-97.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;If your cyst does not go away on its own, your doctor may recommend the following treatment(s) to shrink or remove it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Birth control pills can be recommended to stop you from ovulating and reduce your chances of ovarian cancer&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Laparoscopy can be done to remove the cyst if it is small. This would be done by making a small incision on your body and inserting an instrument inside to remove the cyst.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Laparotomy is when your doctor makes a large incision on your body. This is done when the cyst is big in size or there are several cysts that need to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Hysterectomy can be done if your doctor determines that the cyst is cancerous and remove your ovaries and uterus. This procedure is done only in extreme circumstances and is rarely performed solely due to the presence of ovarian cysts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Concerning Symptoms of Ovarian Cysts Women of All Ages Need to Know About","description":"The symptoms that can tell the presence of these dangerous growths"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/b/3ef68fc8de06643c0a6f1da394b5c22b_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/b/4ac435ba45cf83bce6af8e11174a70fb_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"11 Ways to Get Rid of Gnats"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/b/3de98c73d26bd9340ee1c2c0338dbf2b_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"13 Shocking Facts About the Ancient Greeks"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
