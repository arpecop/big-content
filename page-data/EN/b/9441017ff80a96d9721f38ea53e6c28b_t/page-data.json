Well if you didn’t then now is the time to start questioning its existence because we are taking you on a journey of two lovers, who survived 50 years of engagement without even being aware of what fate had in store for them. Without being aware but still so hopeful about it. This is the beautiful story of a couple who survived years apart from each other. Even got married to other people to move on but never could. In the end it was they themselves who were meant to be just like they believed. Welcome to the story of Janice Rude and Prentiss William.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-384.jpeg&quot;/&gt;hyperactivz.com &lt;h2&gt;How did it start?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-386.jpeg&quot;/&gt;hyperactivz.com &lt;p&gt;I am sure most of you know how these stories go. Especially if you are a big fan of Shakespeare, keep the tragic story of ‘Romeo and Juliet’ (minus the main tragedy because we so aren’t going there) in mind whilst reading this article. There was a girl called Janice, studying as well as supporting a part time job in a food hall. There was a boy called Prentiss, who went to the same college and the same hall, but not for the food but for the charming female who had served him breakfast more than once. He became addicted to her presence after the first time she served him a plate of food. Eyes met and the hearts collided, and both ended up falling in love with each other. During the time they were in the university and still studying, the two of them got engaged and were so excited that they even announced it on the local newspaper. Who wouldn’t be excited about spending the rest of their life with someone they were so deeply in love with? Who wouldn’t want to spend every minute of their life together when they were so happy with each other’s presence already? To them the other was a drug, one marriage was going to act as an anchor to legally prescribe them to one another, but when has everything gone like we have wanted it to?&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;What happened when tragedy struck?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-387.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikinut.com &lt;p&gt;They might be physically walking away from each other but their shadows knew they weren’t meant to stay apart. You must be wondering how this all adds up to become a tragic Shakespearean story, well here’s why it’s so relatable with that. Once the Janice’s father found out (let’s call him Lord Capulet), he disapproved really heavily of the couple’s union. We aren’t fully aware as to why he did not want his daughter to marry Prentiss but one could assume it was because the boy was young and incapable of supporting himself or Janice at the moment or the more common excuse of the father not wanting his child to be distracted from her studies due to some man in her life. His disapproval was not only vocal, it was threatening as well. Otherwise would just a disapproving note in vocals be enough to part the loving couple? No, it wouldn’t have been enough, let’s just say Janice’s father was very well aware of that when he came up with this not so creative threat. He vowed to cut off all the financial support he had been providing his daughter including her College funding. Being broke at the time and just getting by on her salary, her education hanging by a thread the girl conceded to her father’s demands. This was after crying, pleading, raging and finally acting cold towards him that made her accept his decision seeing it had no such effect on him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What happened afterwards?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-388.jpeg&quot;/&gt;susanwinter.net &lt;p&gt;Now is the time you are probably hoping the couple got reunited like every other love story. That is not what happened. At the very least not as early as we hoped it would. Actually 50 years too late if you ask us but better late than never right? After breaking off the engagement the couple parted ways, extremely depressed. This however did not stop them from marrying other people, but as expected, that did not work out well for either of them as they both went through bad marriages and divorces. This ruined not 2 but 4 lives. All of these people had to go through various forms of turmoil because of the stubbornness of one person who is clearly Janice’s father. Bet that made you a bit sad, but hold the tears in because something good did come out of the bad no matter how long it took for that to take place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Their delayed happy ending:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-389.jpeg&quot;/&gt;hyperactivz.com     &lt;p&gt;They say true love never dies. This story will tell you how true that is. Not only will it leave you wanting more but it might just make you shed a few happy tears for the couple too. After 50 years of being apart, Janice found a newspaper clipping hidden by her mother which was of the couple announcing their engagement exactly 50 years prior to that very day. Clearly the mother was in favor of something the father clearly wasn’t but that was the only push Janice needed to be reunited with the love of her life. Standing at the alter in her beautiful dress, her face glowing with the biggest smile anyone has ever seen on a bride, and the groom’s grin at the same par. Happy to be united, the couple stood at the alter 50 years later, taking their vows again, showing the world nothing was impossible. Their love never dying even after years of being apart. And who was to say that love is a frivolous little thing?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Daughter's Forced to Break up With Fiancé.
