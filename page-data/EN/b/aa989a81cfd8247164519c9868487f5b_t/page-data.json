Your heightened sensitivity to the spirit world means you are exceptionally intuitive, to the level that people have described you as “psychic”. However, despite and perhaps maybe because of these abilities, the future is something that frightens you. Their relationship is more on the spiritual level rather than physical. They do not click with people unless they form a mental bond with them. They are very cautious when they are around people whose energy is negative. If they find such people in their surrounding they get uncomfortable and they might even experience anxiety. They might feel what you are feeling without you having to express yourself. They are very sensitive people and find it very easy to understand what you are going through and can think from your perspective. They find it really easy to stand in your shoes and look at things from your point of view. You will find these people to be very selective when it comes to making friends and tend to be introverted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Violet&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-downloads-9-10-2262-new-folder-5-jp.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-downloads-9-10-2262-new-folder-5a-j.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;You are a visionary and you’re someone who can daydream and change the world with spiritual love.

This is knows to be a water energy and with this energy a person’s emotions are connected with their spiritual personality. As these people are like water, their danger zone is to go into things too deeply. These people go so further down the downward spiral that they find themselves in a difficult place to get out. They lose themselves and lose their focus also. This way they lose track of all the things in life and get drained in it. They have to realign their life goals and make sure they have not lost the sense of reality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their danger zone lies where they start working in places like the kitchen and bedroom. Over sleeping, over-eating, going too deeply into their emotions and not focusing on the daily work that needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Red&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-downloads-9-10-2262-new-folder-6-jp.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-admin-downloads-9-10-2262-new-folder-6a-j.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Red is the color of vitality, so your energy connects you to all living creatures, making you extremely empathetic.

They are extremely particular when it comes to being responsible and accountable for their work. They gravitate towards things that are creative and fall into it with an intense passion. Especially in things that are linked to home. This color translates differently when it comes to different cultures as this color is linked to the crown chakra. Physically and spiritually their interest lies in things that make them feel liberated and free. They like to be involved with the community and feel connected.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Their danger zone lies where their intentions walk in. Everything seems intense to them and that is where things start to overwhelm them. These feelings consume them and drain their energy. Your room should have a lot of sunlight, as darkness is not something that brings positive effects for this person. For some people darkness brings peace and relaxation of the mind, but not for people with this energy. As these people are out there and well- connected, they are involved in activities that fulfil their social need. They crave for interaction and how they feed off it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"What Color Is Your Energy According to Zodiac?","description":"Colors define who you are and how you function."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/b/aa989a81cfd8247164519c9868487f5b_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/b/abc6f6a8ad12154c8fa37665f53e5feb_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Tricks To Look Gorgeous In ANY Situation"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/b/98cc9b12c83ea0ab963f58aaade0c02b_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Only a Real Genius Can Guess the Movie from the Riddle"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
