Like literally, sewn into it for the manufacturers to make sure that it is read. Mostly it is stuff like washing instructions, fabric details, drying and ironing instructions. But do we read it? Na-han! Like, I have been wearing pants for so long that I don’t want a tag to tell me how to wear my pants. Or would I really check what the tag says &lt;em&gt;every &lt;/em&gt;time I buy a new cotton shirt? Of course not, that’d be silly. They all say the same thing anyway, right? Wrong!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/c-users-administrator-downloads-1-11-2554-01-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via twitter &lt;p&gt;This woman named Brittany Packnett who is an Activist, educator and writer hopped into ThirdLove to check out some bras. She then decided to try one on and took it into the changing rooms. The bra came with a few tags that all of them do blah, blah, blah. One of those tags was literally titled ‘How to put on a bra’ and since we have all been wearing them since like forever, we don’t need that kind of instruction in our life, right? That’s what Brittany thought too and she proceeded to ignore it, just like any normal person would do, and popped it on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The tag that comes on the bra is *literally* titled, “How To Put On a Bra.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was like…’girl bye I been doin this’ and popped it on. pic.twitter.com/yy0niYWURC&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Brittany Packnett (@MsPackyetti) October 12, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, just on a whim and out of curiosity she took a glance, just one glance at the tag and her whole life would never be the same now. Brittany was SHOOK!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;.@ThirdLove just told I’ve been putting on my bras wrong for twenty years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You probably have, too. pic.twitter.com/eHRWVp11OA&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Brittany Packnett (@MsPackyetti) October 12, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It had some very specific instructions like to start by wearing it on the &lt;em&gt;loosest &lt;/em&gt;hook. You heard me, the loosest! And apparently, not a lot of people knew about that.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wait. The LOOSEST?!?!?? https://t.co/kKcFQQfpaB&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Devon! (@devtronactivate) October 12, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I thought the middle clasp was supposed to be most indicative that the bra fits properly pic.twitter.com/hcnTN6ZAmp&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Mellzah S. Pumpkins (@Mellzah) October 12, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People blamed their mothers for handing the wrong info down. Apparently, people’s mothers have been wearing bras wrong all their lives too.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;MY MAMA TOLD ME TO USE IT DONT JUDGE ME OMG 😩😩😩 https://t.co/5az8yMLqmN&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Brittany Packnett (@MsPackyetti) October 12, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OMG, what?

With time and washing they lose their elastic and that’s why you have to start wearing them at the loosest, most comfortable setting. Brittany also had never done ‘proper breast placement’ and it had her in tears.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;PROPER PLACEMENT EVERY TIME. So important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— timothyanne (@timothyanne) October 12, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She hadn’t been treating her boobs properly and that’s just not right.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But then I decided to read it…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And I was all wrong. It was in the middle clasp and I did *not* do proper breast placement. pic.twitter.com/zc4gZdrAT7&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Brittany Packnett (@MsPackyetti) October 12, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;She just never thought that, that was a thing. I mean, who did?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And look…before you judge me…I love my breasts, but they have never been big enough to need to be placed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or so I thought. pic.twitter.com/MNSV8G3dRl&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Brittany Packnett (@MsPackyetti) October 12, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brittany Packnett made a life altering discovery that day and questioned how she had even been living all this time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;MY WHOLE POST-PUBESCENT LIFE HAS BEEN A LIE. pic.twitter.com/mhWuZMiOKv&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Brittany Packnett (@MsPackyetti) October 12, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All this new information makes one over-whelmed, no doubt and Brittany wasn’t just overwhelmed, she was hardcore SHOOK! I mean what else have we been doing wrong our lives?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is not an ad of any kind. I just got tired of hearing @crissles brag about how comfy her boobs were so I tried @ThirdLove.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’M SHOOK. pic.twitter.com/Z88gec0Cjy&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Brittany Packnett (@MsPackyetti) October 12, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A couple of other heroines came forward with sage advice.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Btw Nordstrom wonder bra woman also told me the wire near your armpit should be lying flat aka not sitting on breast tissue pic.twitter.com/sUGcFX02s7&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— ✨Joslin✨ (@joslinschultz) October 12, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another angel came forward with this piece of vital information. Your bra strap at the back is supposed to be parallel with the ground. So if it hikes up your back, girl go get a new bra. This happens when women don’t get the right cup size for them and instead compensate a smaller cup by tightening the strap at the back and tugging the ones on top. Wrong, wrong, wrong!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A lot of women wear a too-small cup size and compensate by upping the band size (&amp;amp; then tightening the shoulder straps). This doesn&#39;t work. pic.twitter.com/EDNuZOgNqj&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— digne (@lesmissy1) October 12, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A lot of people raised their voice over how even professional fittings had them fitted with wrong sizes and cups. It is astounding that a majority of women still don’t know their right cup size and how can they when even the most professional of places have them fitted wrong!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Raise your hand if you were personally victimized by VS 😭😭😭 pic.twitter.com/BCLzStzBfj&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Rachel (@_deardiaryyy) October 12, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;vs insisted i was the largest size they carry even though i could see i needed to go like two sizes up. 🙄&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— seasidesonnets (@_nele_p) October 12, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I got professionally fitted at VS and a dept. store.
