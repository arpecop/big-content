After triggering the WWII and causing a staggering 60 to 85 million people to die as a result, who can really blame people for hating him as much as they do? As a result, Hitler’s mention is nothing short of being synonymous with connotations of murder, war and misery. Hitler openly expressed his hatred towards the Jews, going as far as to want to eradicate their race from the face of this world completely. In his book, titled “Mein Kampf’, Hitler openly talked about his desire to drive the Jews and other minorities as far away from German’s culture as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While his motives may be questionable, his leadership skills were grudgingly admirable. When he was about to invade Poland and trigger the chain of events that would eventually lead to WWII, Hitler rallied his troops by quoting examples of Genghis Khan. He said that while Genghis Khan led millions of innocents to slaughter, history remembers him as the founder of the Mongol state instead of a murderer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As an aftermath of the Holocaust, 6 million Jews and 5 million other minorities were killed. This made up for a staggering 78% of the entire Jewish population. From the time period of 1941 to 1945, Jews and other ethnic minorities were singled out and murdered by Hitler’s Nazi forces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we think of someone as out rightly destructive as Hitler, we don’t think of other aspects to their personality. Because it is so hard to imagine being this violent, we start imagining them as killing machines rather than actual people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This leads to small things, like keeping hobbies or being dedicated to animals, seem like a much bigger shock than it really should be. In spite of being one of the worst men in history, and one of the best documented as well, there are a few things that remain unknown about him. Here are some mind-blowing facts about Hitler that you probably did not know of before:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hitler Was Temporarily Blinded At Least Once In a Gas Attack&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1776.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Hitler is said to have been temporarily blinded due to a mustard gas attack on the camp he was staying at during the course of the WWI. The severity of this attack led to him being hospitalised in Germany. While he was in the hospital, news came of Germany’s defeat, and Hitler supposedly suffered from a second bout of temporary blindness on account of this horrific news.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hitler Most Likely Had Parkinson’s Disease&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1777.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Several historians who have researched upon Hitler have concluded that Hitler might have suffered from a large array of diseases, one of which is Parkinson’s. Parkinson’s is a degenerative disease of the nervous systems that not only affects movement but memory and behaviour of the person affected by it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is reported by several historians that Hitler suffered from evident signs of the mental and physical symptoms of Parkison’s. On account of this finding, several historians further argue that his decision making prowess was significantly affected due to his probable dementia as a result of the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hitler Never Visited a Single Concentration Camp&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1778.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;A vast majority of the 11 million Jews and other ethnic minorities that were killed at the hands of Hitler during the holocaust were murdered at concentration camps. Out of the 1,200 concentration camps that littered the country, the first one was established in 1933 right after Hitler became the Chancellor. Their initial purpose was to detain and torture political rivals and union organizers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the time period of the WWII, these camps became places of grave misconduct and injustice. Millions of people belonging to minorities were not only enslaved here but also forced to work as laborers, tortured and mass murdered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In spite of initiating them, Hitler never visited even a single concentration camp. Hitler is famous for keeping himself at a distance from the actual killing, merely giving controlled orders from afar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;One of Hitler’s Hobbies Was Whistling&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1779.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;One of Hitler’s favorite things to do to relax and calm his nerves was to whistle tunes. His favorite was apparently, ‘when you wish upon a star’. He is reported to have entertained his guests by whistling them impeccable tunes and even whistled when he was extremely happy, like after the fall of Paris in 1940.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Another one of his favorite tunes was, ‘Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf’. This is ironic considering ‘The Wolf’ was a popular nickname of Hitler.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hitler Wanted to Become a Priest When He Was a Child&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1780.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Hitler was born to a religious Catholic mother and an anticlerical father. While growing up, Hitler was part of the church choir and went as far as to take lessons to improve his vocals. It is rumoured that at one point, Hitler even wanted to become a priest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, later Hitler was found to favour some parts of being a Protestant. His last plans involved eradicating the influence of Churches in Germany. This indicates that while he may have wanted to be a priest as a child, he died an atheist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3 of Hitler’s 6 Siblings Died When He was a Child&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1781.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Growing up, Hitler had six siblings. Hitler was the fourth child of his parents, Alois Hitler and Klara Pölzl. Four of his siblings were dead before he was 25, three of them having passed away in infancy. They were named Gustav, Ida and Otto.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hitler Made Laws against Animal Cruelty&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1782.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;On account of all the atrocities that Hitler committed towards humanity, it seems strange that he was so empathetic towards animals. Hitler greatly despised animal cruelty and made an effort to put a stop to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hitler’s diet was strictly vegetarian. Moreover, he also tried to deter others from eating meat. He would give graphic narrations of animal slaughterings to deter his guests from eating meat at parties. To get a fresh supply vegetables to fuel his vegetarian lifestyle, he had a greenhouse built in his home. He enforced animal protection laws and intended to lower meat consumption rates after the war.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hitler Was Nominated For Nobel Peace Prize in 1939&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1783.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Shady characters like Hitler and Stalin have both been nominated for a peace prize. This sure does lower the prestige of the Nobel Prize in your eyes, doesn’t it? Stalin was nominated for the Nobel Peace award, the biggest award given to only the most dedicated advocates of peace in both 1945 and 1948 to applaud him for his efforts towards ending the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, unlike Stalin’s nomination, Hitler was nominated as an ironic joke. EGC Brandt, a Swedish parliament member, nominated Hitler as a joke in 1939. Brandt’s intention was to satirically nominate someone like Hitler for the biggest Peace Prize there is. However, his ironic joke was ill received by the government, and he was in the end forced to withdraw his nomination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the controversy did not meet it’s end there. Earlier, in 1935, Carl von Ossietzky was awarded the Nobel Prize. Carl von Ossietzky openly opposed Hitler and his policies which meant that him receiving a Nobel Prize angered Hitler. Following this event, Hitler forbade any German to ever receive a Nobel Prize, neither was the Press allowed to document or mention the Prize.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hitler Shaved Part of His Moustache for a Reason:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1784.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Hitler’s toothbrush style moustache has become ironically linked to his image. However, it was not always groomed like that. During the days of the First World War, Hitler sported a full moustache. The soldiers in the trenches were gassed with mustard gas and other lethal gases in order to deter progress. While other soldiers donned masks, Hitler’s full moustache prevented him from fully putting his mask on, resulting in severe poisoning and a near-death experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hitler was rejected from art school&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1785.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock     &lt;p&gt;Most of us know that Hitler’s failed career in art is what eventually led to his life as a fascist. However, what you might not be aware of is the fact that he was rejected not once but twice from art school. In fact, the second time around, he was rejected so blatantly that he was not even allowed to take a part in the entrance exam. Ouch!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Facts About Hitler You Didn't Know About","description":"He would give graphic narrations of animal slaughterings to deter his guests from eating meat at parties."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/b/62a09fcb4348a1f9af758df3df1dc43b_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/b/67c54a5f664d211f1ad835e9f14a2cbb_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"12 Traits All Men Subconsciously Look for in Women"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/b/59ac56bf6ceeed04c9cddd053722d43b_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"19 Distressing Signs That You Are Surrounded by Negativity"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
