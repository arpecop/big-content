In addition to this they might not have a support system in the shape of a caring family. Even with all that, sometimes individual get drawn to negative influences and ultimately tarnish their careers beyond repair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following are few such young souls who lost their way in the bright lights of ‘Tinsel Town’ and after all that fame and glory did a really poor job growing up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Macaulay Culkin&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; It&#39;s December!!!🎄That means home alone season startsss! So excited for Christmas and ready to watch home alone every day.❤ Have a nice day😘 #homealone #macaulayculkin&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Macaulay Culkin (@macaulay_culkin_) on Dec 2, 2017 at 5:28am PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Macaulay Culkin debuted on the silver screen in 1988 film ‘Rocket Gibraltar’. However he got his fame with the highest grossing movie of 1990 ‘Home Alone’. The movie is about an adorable young kid Kevin McCalister who thwarted the bad guys who came with intent to rob his home where he is left alone by mistake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Five years later news reports emerged of his father misappropriating his fortune. This ensued a custody battle between his father and mother which is naturally traumatic for a young kid. Culkin got himself arrested in Oklahoma in 2004 for possession of illegal prescription drugs and 17 grams of pot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe it was the darling image of an innocent kid in the minds of the people but Culkins association with drugs and the way his personality changed never sit well with people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Edward Furlong&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Monday 😒😒😒#edwardfurlong&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Beerfinder General (@brat_sabbath) on Jun 12, 2017 at 8:58am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edward Furlong starred in the famous action movie ‘Terminator 2: Judgement Day’ as John Connor at the age of 14. He also played other roles like 1988’s movie ‘Pecker’ and ‘American History X’. He was no longer under the responsibility of his parents after getting romantically involved with his 29 year old tutor at the age of 16. The couple spent six years together after splitting in 1998 where she cited domestic abuse as the reason for parting of ways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the 2000s Furlong’s career just could not recover and saw a steady decline with reports of substance abuse and several reports of domestic violence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2006 he married his girlfriend Rachael Bella which only lasted for three years after she cited domestic abuse as the main reason. Infact he avoided jail time for violence against another girlfriend in 2013 for a stint in rehab.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He will also attend domestic violence counseling after the 90 days are up. Indeed sad to see such a talented child star wastes his career this way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Lindsay Lohan&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Whatever anyone says, I am FOR #womenempowerment #strongwoman #BESTRONG #karma will always takes its toll 𗁡𗁨𗁡❤️ #womensrights&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Lindsay Lohan (@lindsaylohan) on Oct 18, 2017 at 2:40pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She started her career under the spotlights with Disney’s ‘Parent Trap’ at the age of 11 in 1998. She followed this with 2003’s ‘Freaky Friday’ and 2004 ‘Mean Girls’ which made her a household name and an actress with a bright and promising future. Unfortunately she remained in the tabloids and news for all the wrong reasons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of the times it was her relationship with alcohol consumption. She even attended Alcoholics Anonymous and rehab for 30 days to rid herself of this habit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She was even caught with cocaine and DUI in 2006 which landed her for one day in jail and community service in addition to attending alcohol education program. Things got worse in 2010 as she was yet again caught with DUI and was ordered 90 days in jail of which she spent 14 in jail and the remaining in in-patient rehab. The talent could have been put to some good use but she really denied herself those opportunities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2.

She found her way to the silver screen soon after that with a couple of stage productions including ‘Annie’ and ‘The Secret Garden’. She was a regular on Nickelodeons from 1990s to 2000s ‘All That’. She even starred in ‘The Amanda Show’ from 1999 to 2002. She even starred in several movies from 2003 to 2010.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However things suddenly took a turn for the worst after that. She was ticketed for using cell phone while driving in 2012 and later that same year charged with DUI. Five months later she was facing trial for two counts of hit and run. In May 2013 she was arrested for possession of pot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Things aggravated more when she started a fire in front of a stranger’s house. She received mental health treatment for almost seven to eight months and now finds balance in her life with her parents by enrolling in a fashion institute.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Shia Lebouf&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Shia LaBeouf (@shialabeoufdaily) on Sep 8, 2017 at 12:57am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Propelled to fame in Transformers as Sam Whitwicky, Lebouf suffered a traumatic childhood due to the mental and verbal abuse of his father who was a Vietnam war veteran. To keep his sanity intact he started stand-up comedy at the age of 10. In 2000 he was cast in Disney’s show ‘Even Stevens’ as Louis Stevens. His first appearance on silver screen was in 2003 movie ‘Holes’ at 17 years of age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two years later his troubles began with an angry exchange of words with his neighbor where he ended up ramming his vehicle into his neighbor’s car. In 2007 he was caught for illegal trespassing for refusing to leave the Walgreens store after the security guard escorted him out for misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;In 2008 he was fined for unlawful smoking and later that years charged with DUI. The troubles always have a way of finding him and making him appear in the headlines for all the wrong reasons.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"5 Talented Child Celebs Who Ruined Their life In A Matter of Seconds","description":"The glitz and glamour of Hollywood is sometimes too much to take for impressionable young minds especially if they let all that fame to their heads.
