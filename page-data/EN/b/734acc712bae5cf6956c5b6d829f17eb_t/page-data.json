Emma Murano who celebrated her 117th birthday in the month of November 2017 states that the secret to her long and happy life is to stay away from man. Sounds interesting isn’t it? Lol Many of the world’s oldest people are spread all across the world especially in Italy and Jamaica.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reasons for such an extended life are often associated with healthy diet and staying stress free.

The following factors will help you figure out whether these are present in your life or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Eat oatmeal&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1250.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Adele Dunlap who is 113 years old suggests that oatmeal is a healthy food to consume. Although she was a habitual smoker along with her husband they both stopped smoking when they experienced their first heart attack. Since then she started to eat everything as reported by her daughter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Having a happy family&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1251.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Being around those people whom you love and they love you back is the reason you are actually able to add some years to your life. Just like Ana Vela Rubio who is the oldest living person in Spain. She has two children, four grandchildren, and seventeen great grandchildren. As reported by her daughter Rubio had been a great mother maintained a really positive attitude at all times which helped her to stay alive for so many years. So, if you want to stay alive for many years just keep your family happy and who knows you might become the oldest person alive! As Violet brown who is Jamaica’s oldest person says “Honor your mother and father so that your days may be long”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Staying independent&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1252.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The best way to increase those age figures can be done by handling your financial needs yourself. This is important since you will not have to rely on someone else for your financial needs and might also be beneficial in the long-run. The fact that money leads to a lot of fights sometimes also leading to deadly fights it is advisable to handle your money your way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;It’s in the genes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1253.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;While it may not always have to be associated with your diet or lifestyle it could be a result of purely genetics. It might be possible that you are living a longer life as a result of your genetics. Moreover, some researches also suggest that immunity to certain diseases or increased chemicals in the brain could be a reason of increased body functions thus leading to a longer life than normal people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Work stress&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1254.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Although work stress might not be the factor to reduce your years surprisingly it could be the reason you live longer if you manage it effectively. The Longevity study conducted by Stanford researchers Howard S. Friedman and Leslie R Martin actually ended up suggesting that hard working people live a longer life than those who are lazy. It was also concluded that hard working people actually tend to live healthy and happy lives as well as being they are more active socially!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Give something back to the community&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1255.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;If you are helping those in need not only in the financial terms but by teaching them a skill or two you are increasing your figures. It makes you feel more good about yourself once you tend to give something back to the society in any form possible. As they say “give a man fish to eat and you feed him for a day teach a man how to fish and then you forever”.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;Have a lot of friends&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1256.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Socializing helps you stay active and full of life. Seeing your friends and having a laugh with them after stressful days in your life will help you to stay alive for many years. Close friends are always there to provide you the emotional support and are there when you need them in some matters. It helps you release dopamine and oxytocin which help your brain activity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stay in healthy relationships&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1257.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Surrounding yourself with positive people is the key to stay alive for a lot of years. So better be with those people who give positive vibes and support you. They must be concerned about you and uplift you in the times of need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Be physically active&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1258.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;If you really want to increase your age do not be a couch potato if you are one. Be up about and moving and stay as much active as you can. This will help you stay fit and healthy and who knows might also increase those figures for you. Also, being active can actually prevent you from the chances of developing many deadly diseases. So, get going dude!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Adequate sleep&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1259.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Try to take the normal sleep of eight hours and stick to it strictly. It is important because as they say “early to bed early to rise makes one healthy, wealthy and wise”. This is really true because our body needs rest and that even in its proper hours so that it can function accordingly! Those who go to bed late at night and wake up late feel lethargic and more tired throughout the day which also limits productivity. As Misao Okawa who was Japan’s oldest citizen said “eat and sleep and you will live a long time”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Maintain hygiene&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1260.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Staying neat and clean can also increase those years for you since you feel fresh about yourself and feel good too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Have a pet&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1261.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Owning a pet reduces your stress levels and keeps you happy as suggested by a study. They have a certain soothing effect on you once you look at them and make you feel happy. According to a research it actually prevents the risk of heart disease as well as reduces the blood pressure. Another study found out that people who take their dogs out for a daily walk tend to live an average of seven years or linger rather than those who do not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Overall personality&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1262.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Your personality also has an important role in determining your age. If you are a straightforward person you will be able to live for longer years since your mind is always clear. Being an introvert can prove to be dangerous for you since they never share anything with anyone. Also, you should try to be a positive person and keep all the negative feelings away from yourself so that you can live longer. You should laugh a lot, stop smoking, believe in yourself and you will be able to increase those age numbers miraculously for yourself. Laughing helps to prevent anxiety, stress and makes you forget depressing memories. You should be an optimistic person rather than someone who stays glued to the past and is not willing to move on. That will create negativity and send negative vibes in your body. Never be a person who regrets but rather be someone who goes with the flow!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Regular checkup&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1263.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock     &lt;p&gt;It is important that you always get yourself medically checked so that any potential dangerous things would be easily identified and remedial actions can be taken on time!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"109 Year Old Woman Says Secret to a Long Life Is Avoiding Men","description":"I am sure all of us will want to know the secret to a long, happy and a healthy life.
