They are usually irritable and typically appear on your elbows, knees or scalp. However these patches can break out on any part of your skin besides the above mentioned skin regions. The skin scales is the result of excessively rapid proliferation of skin cells. This rapid proliferation by skin cells is triggered by inflammatory chemicals produced by specialized white blood cells. In simpler words your skin cells life cycle is rapidly increased and they start to accumulate under your skin hence the red, scaly patches.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The irritability factor and affected area of the skin may differ from mild and small area affected to red inflamed skin along the entire body. Psoriasis is considered incurable long-term inflammatory skin condition which always varies in its course of diagnosis. Sometimes it may improve and other times may aggravate. In fact it may go away completely at times staying in remission for a long period of time. However most of the people report worsening of their psoriasis in winter season.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It may affect anyone regardless of their gender or age but mostly reported in early adult years. Naturally due to the skin condition and consequent damage to appearance the quality of life of a psoriasis patient takes a hit and lead to difficulty in adjusting to this disease. Recently it has been discovered that there is a strong correlation between diabetes, heart problems, being overweight and psoriasis. Even your genetics may play a part in making you a likely candidate for psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although incurable you could take certain measures to decrease the likelihood of psoriasis. Healthier lifestyles like quitting smoking, keeping your weight in check, managing stress and moisturizing your skin regularly may tackle the symptoms of psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-288.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;The causes are not fully understood but it is an immune system mediated disease because it involves specialized T cells or white blood cells called neutrophils. These white blood cells normally are present in your system to fend off any foreign bodies and keep you safe from different viruses and bacteria. However if one has psoriasis these T cells start to attack the healthy skin cells considering them as foreign bodies. The T cells in their bid to heal the body and do their job against a ‘perceived’ infection mistakenly destroy the healthy skin cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The overactive T cells naturally trigger more production of healthy skin cells and consequently to fight them off more T cells are produced. The increasing number of dead skin cells start to accumulate under the skin hence the patches appear. The redness is caused by the dilated blood vessels which cause sensation of warmth at the affected area and the slightly raised appearance. The process becomes a never ending cycle where more and more skin cells move to the surface of skin and form thick, scaly patches. What is not clear is the actual trigger which causes the white blood cells to start behaving this way. Researchers partly blame genetics and environmental factor but still looking for definite causes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Psoriasis triggers:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However there are some possible triggers which may play a pivotal role in increasing the chances of contracting psoriasis. These are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1. Infections of throat or skin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2. Injury to skin like a cut or scrape, burn, a bug bite or even sunburn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3. Taking too much stress or depression. As too much stress negatively impacts your immune system and increase the risk of psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4. Heavy alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;5. Smoking excessively. As it may provide the disease stronger foundation to spread and take hold of the body in the initial stages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;6. Vitamin D deficiency&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apart from this family history may also increase the risk of one getting psoriasis where if one parent has the disease the child has two fold risk and if both have psoriasis the child faces even more risk. Things are also not helped if one is obese because lesions (plaques) associated with psoriasis often develop in skin folds.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-290.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;The signs and symptoms are different for everyone as psoriasis affects different areas and has many different types. The most common signs and symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;  Red patches of skin covered with thick silvery scales. Scaling in small pockets which mostly are observed in children. Dry and cracked skin that may bleed occasionally. Itching and burning sensation and soreness. Thickened and ridged nails. Swollen and stiff joints which is an indication of psoriatic arthritis.  &lt;p&gt;Most types of psoriasis go through cycles. They may flare up for weeks or months and then subside by itself. It could even go into complete remission for years on end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-292.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;As already mentioned in the causes, deficiency of vitamin D may lead to psoriasis. This vitamin is necessary in all immune-mediated diseases since it is a powerful immune system regulator. The required levels of this essential vitamin should be in the range of 50-70 ng/ml year round. This vitamin holds the key to keep the working of immune system seamless hence minimizing the onset of psoriasis. Unfortunately 80% of the patients have deficiency of this important vitamin especially in winters. There are also around 50% cases of vitamin D deficiency in summers which is surprising since we have ample sunshine for the synthesis of vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is responsible for regulating skin cell (keratinocyte) growth and differentiation. It also handles immune functions of T cells and other specialized white blood cells. Both the primary factors responsible for psoriasis. There are certain medications available in the market for treatment but either they have some serious side effects or they only provide relief temporarily. The best possible treatment is keeping your vitamin D levels in the healthy range.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2004, Professor Dr. Michael Holick published the book &lt;em&gt;UV Advantage&lt;/em&gt; where he encouraged readers to get appropriate sunlight and exposure to maintain healthy levels of vitamin D. At the time he used active vitamin D to treat psoriasis and it is worth mentioning that he won &lt;em&gt;American Skin Association’s Research Achievement Award&lt;/em&gt; for his efforts. Interestingly the doctor was asked to step down as professor by the &lt;em&gt;American Academy of Dermatology&lt;/em&gt; simply because they recommended to be never exposed to one ray of sunlight for your entire life. Despite the differences of opinion it is now established that exposure to UV light of the sun for sensible amount of time kills off the activated T cells in your system and thus slow down the process of cell multiplication which is a direct consequence of overactive T cells. This directly translates into reduced scaling and inflammation of the skin and overall improvement in the effects caused by psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-294.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Although it only requires a sensible exposure to the sun many people report of lower levels of vitamin D. Even a country like India where there is ample sunlight available, out of the 37000 people tested for vitamin D levels 69% reported 20 to 30 ng/ml (the optimum limit is 50 to 70 ng/ml). Usually supplements are not recommended for vitamin D but if you are opting for that path we recommend vitamin D3 not the synthetic D2 and synergize it with vitamin K2 and magnesium to make it effective. Vitamin A, zinc and boron are also beneficial for increasing efficiency and functioning of vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Magnesium is necessary because it helps convert vitamin D into its active form and make it function properly. It activates enzymes which will make the absorption of vitamin D easier. Also helps in proper assimilation of calcium.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vitamin K2 is responsible for directing the calcium to move to proper areas of the body where it is needed and prevent calcification of soft tissues and arteries.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;It is also recommended to have a diet of healthy fats as well as vitamin D is water soluble and it helps in better assimilation into the system. If you are not into supplements you can take organic whole food diet rich in appropriate nutrients to fulfill your requirements. It would also not harm to make healthier life choices and make deliberate effort as it is your health in question after all.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Psoriasis: Causes, Symptoms, and the Vitamin You're Missing","description":"Causes and Symptoms and Essential Vitamins to Offset the Effects"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/b/fd7416aa44906bb1f29d56d1a18d821b_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/c/07585d7a66938e534a747b2111d899ac_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"These Exercises Will Help You Get Rid of Those Glasses Forever"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/b/f6838bb79d0d72cfe63b04cf58955bdb_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"DIY Decor Ideas to Make Your Halloween More Spooky"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
