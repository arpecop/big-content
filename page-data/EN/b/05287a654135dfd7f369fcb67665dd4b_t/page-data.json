Cheating. Many other surveys that have been conducted trying to determine the ideal age or even zodiac of the women that are most likely to cheat. The survey in question showed that 40 to 50% of women were likely to deceive their partner by indulging in romantic or physical acts with someone else at least once in their lifetime. Does this make you worried about the new neighbor that just moved in across the street? Or the attractive Professor she mentioned in passing in a dinner conversation? Well don’t be. This particular survey, including 5-6 others carried out by sites and places like illicitencounters.com have determined that 65 to 70% women are most likely to cheat with a colleague at work. Another outcome demonstrates that men are probably going to cheat in view of desire, egotism and their sense of self, while ladies may swing to deceiving on the off chance that they start to feel disregarded by their partner. This survey also shows that how cheating has stemmed not from a personality trait, but most likely by the profession adopted by the female.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: We aren’t saying that these women are inherently bad or that every women in these professions is a cheater. We are just shedding some light on the women in these professions that have had the opportunity to cheat and have seized it. This in no way is meant to demean the profession in question but just to provide a general analysis of some findings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s a list of possible professions in which females are likely indulge in the act of cheating (although most of them wouldn’t recommend it):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Homemakers:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1458.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;These are the trophy wives likely to stay at home, making the place perfect for their husbands and for the society to see but looking for some action on the down low. These particular women have a habit of describing themselves lonely which is easily calculated by looking them up on dating apps like tinder. They would join dating apps in claims of looking for a friend to talk to, although it is possible they might want someone to talk to where there is the emotional connection forming, the physical one won’t take long to make its appearance. Women of this particular profession are also more likely to cheat because of their husband’s lack of love and attention because of his profession and hours spent alone at home become too tedious. This leads the woman to become desperate to either add some spice in her life by indulging in an extra marital affairs or a more mundane reason as seeking a constant dose of companionship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lawyers:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1459.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Have you ever seen Boston Legal? Criminal minds? How to get away with murder? Lie to me? Or any show with a lawyer having an extramarital affair with her colleague? All these shows depict something from reality. Their inspirations of every heroic or good lawyer having an extramarital affair, did not just appear out of thin air, but out of actual incidents that had taken place in other people’s lives. Sitting at work, trying to find out ways to get a client swindling money from other people out of jail whilst littering their desk with cups of coffees hardly gives off exciting vibes. Be that as it may, in the event that you consider how legal advisors are normally viewed as smooth administrators, they could without a doubt talk their way into anybody’s clothes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The business of corresponding:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1460.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Do you know how they came up with the concept of a sex hotline? Don’t be surprised if you guessed correctly. Cheating spouses on the phone. Seeing how much excitement that generated, leave it to people to make a business out of it. A fraction of the time you hear some profound voice whispering tender words to you, spicing up the air, while the other half time somebody is shouting illogically to you. So what better approach to let off that steam than getting comfortable with the supply organizer? Especially the long endless night shifts when their spouse is safely tucked away in bed and realistically speaking, call centers aren’t exactly the most exciting places on this planet. You can expect women there to spice up their life with a little action here and there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sports:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1461.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Did you really think Tiger Woods would be alone in this? We have known men in the sports industry to be caught for cheating many times. Doing something to make our headlines eye catching every day. Just because there are rare cases of women being caught having an extramarital affair while working as a valuable person in the sports industry, does not mean they don’t exist completely. Less publicized is the right term for their situation. Some might even say this is an ideal profession for cheating. Being out of the country on a regular basis and not being questioned about it, trying to satiate the adrenaline rush from playing sports with someone who understands it all too well, is the prime excuse for the women in question to indulge in cheating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Business:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1462.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Mixing business with pleasure shows the office for being the ideal representation of a pot to do it in shows why the women in the business industry part take in this emotional or physical form of hoodwinking. Staying late nights at the office or going on a business trip with an attractive boss or colleague might be enough to sway some women into having a good time and throwing caution to the wind. The tight hair buns or the conservative office clothing could be counted as a costume that’s hiding the reality, or at least most TV shows depict, but then again producers do claim that much of this stems from real life inspirations so who are we to argue? It is not just the idea of opportunity, boredom plays an incredible part in their life too. Slaving away long hours and after hours at the office when the amount of workers lessens and there is no one but that woman and a potentially good looking colleague. Staring at documents and typing away on the computer till your tension reaches a crescendo that the women in question have said they find just easier to give into.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;Dancers:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1463.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;We aren’t just talking about pole dancers or strippers here. Dancing with someone requires a kind of chemistry that gets all your hormones in a frenzy, running, moving your body in tempo you’re your dance partner. This most definitely takes your mind to explore unchartered territories with the man in question whereas dancing for someone gives leeway to emotions urging you to give into temptation, or in other words go all the way with the man who is admiring your body with a sultry gaze. Same as swinging from a pole with most of your clothes off leading you to question how big is the obstacle that’s stopping you from going all the way? Some might not even stop and weigh the consequences of their actions before succumbing to temptations. Wouldn’t want morals to come knocking reality too hard into them now would they?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Artists:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1464.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;This title alone covers a broad spectrum of subtitles. What all of these titles have in common is that they are artists and almost every artist has a muse. The profession could be writing, sculpting, sketching, drawing and many other things. Some of their best works stem from their affairs or the extra marital muses they acquire to spark their creative nerves. A writer coming up with interesting new ideas for the next big romance novel or the next big erotic hit, why not test some boundaries? Why not Step into some deep waters and see how it feels? Why not justify this that they are doing it for the sake of art itself, that they are doing it for the audience and not for themselves? Same goes for sketching and sculpting. Nude portraits or creating the statue akin to the work of Angelo. Perfection requires to feel and to feel requires contact. Everything seems justified. The conscience is silenced and the deed takes place without the alarm being set off, silenced in the name of creativity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DJs:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1465.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Let us build on a scenario to understand this better. Where are DJs most commonly located? At parties. What time are these type of parties likely to take place? After the sun has set. What type of parties are they located in? Nightclubs or clubs in general. What is the atmosphere that these parties exude? Dark, intriguing, sexy and dangerous. What actually makes there parties like that? The music, the lights and the dancing. What acts as a catalyst for the actual action to take place? The drugs and alcohol. Now that the scenario has been successfully built in your head do you understand why it is most likely for women in this profession to cheat? The dark atmosphere of the club embraces them and makes them feel covered and secluded, easy for them to feel safe to do anything. The pulsing beat of the music excites their bodies, pushing out more and more adrenaline to make them want to find activities other than dancing to take part in. Not to mention the biggest form of motivation in the form of drugs and alcohol. Any sort of logic or moral can be waved goodbye to when alcohol and drugs take over your system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Air travel Industry:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1466.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;A female flight attendant or a female pilot, the correlation between the two makes it really easy for a female flight attendants link with a male pilot or a female pilots interaction with that of a male flight attendant can lead to salacious activities. We aren’t just talking about the glorified sexy flight attendant fantasies, but the long hours of travelling to possibly exotic countries, flying away from your better halves prying or well just eyes knocks on your door for a lot of unmentionable possibilities. The idea of possibilities makes it easier whereas the inability to get caught fuels their actions into actually taking place. Heck some just do it for a raise or a promotion but everyone has their own reasons. Cheating in this industry stems from the women’s lack of availability to extract emotional and physical benefits from their spouses leading them to finding such activity elsewhere before the gloom of loneliness on a romantic level comes crashing down on them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Doctors and nurses:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1467.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com     &lt;p&gt;Like many of the other professions mentioned above, this profession has a lot of aspects to it that are common with the ones mentioned above. Starting with working late nights with colleagues to idolizing your boss, his talents and his position, to fantasies and love triangles todays day and age shows in their TV shows, their erotica and their best-selling romance novels. Greys anatomy is a pretty apt example of how love affairs start and how they end. Craving romance, sex or love in a workplace because you barely have time to go home and change as it is becomes a justified norm for most ladies to indulge in a love affair with their colleagues or a boss they are attracted to. The need to cheat might also stem from watching someone saving lives, or watching people die reminding them how short life is and they should probably make the best of it. Not the best excuse but most women that have been evaluated in this survey don’t recommend it to anyone and say it’s a more in the moment kind of thing. Those can be avoided if you try hard enough. Do we need to mention the doctor and nurse love affairs or have the soap operas instilled those facts enough for us to just leave them at this?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Survey Unveils the Top 10 Jobs Where Women Are Most Likely to Cheat","description":"Interested in how profession plays a role in helping or encouraging someone to cheat?
