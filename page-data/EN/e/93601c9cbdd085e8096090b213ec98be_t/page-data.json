No matter what your answer is, it is time to switch gears to becoming a penguin person because this latest news about our little black and white friends is going to make your heart melt and your stomach flutter with awe at their die hard cuteness. Penguins don’t only win your heart with their cute little walking and their dazed eye look, they can also make gestures that not only touch your hearts but make you clutch your chest, tilt your head to one side and smile as well!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1902.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;h2&gt;Where did this happen?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1903.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;You all might have heard about a little black and white bird who can’t fly, swim 5000 miles EVERY year to see his friend in Brazil for saving his life. A good example to relate to our friends or better half’s who can’t even call us back when we need them too. We can all learn a little something from the gratitude the penguin showed his tall human friend. This however is a story that is breaking through about a different penguin in a different setting. The setting being the one in a dense rainy, mostly forested area we all know as New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What made this news go viral?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1904.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;You see funny videos go viral every day, about teenagers, adults, dogs and cats, but once in a while there are these heartwarming videos that grace the internet and let warmth embrace the soul of the people who watch them. A woman named Dee Clark saw this particular bird trying to cross the road today and let the world see what she saw by shooting the video on her phone. The video was later uploaded on Reddit and gained 41,000 views within just a few hours!&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;Who was this special fella?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This special friend is Tawaki Penguin who is also known as the Fiordland Crested Penguin are the ones who form nests in the middle of the deep and dense rain forests of New Zealand and live there. It is not unheard of that these penguins often migrate from place to place with their groups of friends but this little penguin just comes around this place for a visit. So why did the penguin bother crossing the road? To say Hi. This Tawaki risked his life to hop across the road and chat with the man at the other end like they were life-long pals who hadn’t met in a while.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1905.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;h2&gt;Who was the man?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1906.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The man who is said to look somewhat like Clint Eastwood (picture above for a reference), noticed the shocked bystanders and the camera told everyone that almost everyone in the neighborhood had a Penguin as a friend. This lets us know that the purity that existed between this guy and the penguin was replicated with many others, this one serving as the magazine picture of the relationship that exists between men and penguins in general.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What does this tell us?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1907.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock     &lt;p&gt;Looking outside our natural comfort zones and generic choices there are other things, other animals and other people we can all form a connection with if we try hard enough. Not only is this about forming new connections with people it is about maintaining your old ones as well. Be it with your mother, your father, friend or other relatives. If a penguin can leave his nest every once in a while to visit his human friend’s every once in a blue mood even though it does not understand whatever the said friend is talking about, why can’t we step out of our comfort zone and do the same? Of course we would all have to risk being run over by a car like the penguin did but that is a chance everyone has to be willing to take to form this friendship or to be happy and keep everyone happy and even maintain it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Penguin goes out of his way to say hello to human friend","description":"Have you seen the video ‘Friendly Penguin hops up to say hello’?
