They have a great sense of humor and are confident about how ever they look. Real beauty comes in all shapes and sizes, you should just know how to accept it. Very few of these girls are strong enough to show ‘all’ of themselves. These girls surprised us, Tapoos, by posting these daring pictures of themselves. They completely left us speechless.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scroll down to see the shocking pictures these brave girls have posted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#16&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-161.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Duress56 / voat &lt;p&gt;This red headed girl looks beautiful in both pictures. On the left, she has the perfect makeup on and has her hair done. And in the right picture, she’s wearing this beautiful shimmery dress which makes her look beautiful in another kind of way. The only difference is the angle at which the both pictures were taken.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#15&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-162.jpeg&quot;/&gt;DeepFriedCondishunz / voat &lt;p&gt;The woman in the picture has two kinds of pictures. In one, she has done her makeup and hair and has taken a selfie. In the second type of picture, the girl is bare face and has randomly posed for the photo. She looks so innocent and happy with whatever she looks like. That’s exactly how every girl should be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#14&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-163.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Unknown author / Imgur &lt;p&gt;This is the “when you send a pic to your crush vs when you send a pic to your best friend” kinda picture. You can see the major change in facial expressions. In one, she’s posing for a selfie with a beautiful smile and in the second one, she has made a funny face. It’s actually fun to see a girl being goofy and hilarious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#13&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-164.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Unknown author / Imgur &lt;p&gt;Both of the pictures were clearly taken a few seconds or minutes apart. The background, clothes and her makeup are the same. It might be taken before any event or party. In the left picture, she’s trying to be all sexy but the right picture is giving us a hint that she’s excited for what will later happen. The excitement is making her glow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#12&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-165.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Kissedbyken / Instagram &lt;p&gt;Guys do love thick girls. That’s a fact. Obviously, both of these pictures are of the same girl but with different angles. The left picture is in which she’s posing, popping out her butt and showing off her thick thighs. But the right picture is definitely ‘candid’. Even the perfect people with perfect body and features don’t get the best candids. This girl is still rocking in hers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#11&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-166.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Carollbrady / Twitter &lt;p&gt;This picture is another example of the “snaps you send to crush and snaps you send to your bff”. It’s totally fine if you act all foolish and make funny faces at times. Even if you do make such faces often, that doesn’t mean you’re not beautiful. Her right picture is a proof that this girl has the looks and she’s confident enough to show off her goofy side.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#10&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-167.jpeg&quot;/&gt;NoWayGirl / Pinterest &lt;p&gt;This girl definitely has a one hella photogenic face. She’s so beautiful. The left picture is beautiful and she sure does know how to show off her gorgeous features. The right picture might not be perfect but that doesn’t mean she’s not beautiful. Everyone has these kinda pictures. She’s overweight but that’s totally fine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#9&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-168.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Мария Кируша / vk  &lt;/em&gt; &lt;p&gt;What a beautiful face. Looks like the left picture was taken at a photoshoot. She has done the most perfect natural make up and looks flawless while she poses for the camera. The right pictures describes us ALL in our homes. Aren’t we all like this when we are chilling in our pajamas at home? If she makes a straight face even without makeup, she’s beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;#8&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-169.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Immagingerkid / reddit &lt;p&gt;The ginger head girl is very cute and chubby. Her piercing blue eyes make her whole face looks beautiful and not to forget, her other features are very good looking too. The right picture is really relatable, at least to us. When you’re excited for some reason or have something planned up, sure you make such kind of faces. The girl is beautiful no matter what funny face she makes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#7&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-170.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Зоя Макарова / vk&lt;em&gt;  &lt;/em&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what if you don’t have the perfect brown or big eyes? That’s not the definition of beauty. This girl is a perfect example of “get a girl who can do both”. This kind of face can be made so beautiful with makeup and even without makeup, she looks good. Well the main thing is that she’s confident on how she looks, with or without makeup.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#6&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-171.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Natasha Winter / Pinterest &lt;p&gt;That face is so perfect. Like seriously. This is another picture example in which they were taken after a few seconds or minutes. If you personally ask, she looks good in both of the pictures. She has the most beautiful eyes, her makeup looking flawless and her hair done in a good way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#5&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-172.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Mastranios / reddit &lt;p&gt;To be honest, if it was me or you, we would’ve never shared the picture like this girl has shared. She has a good looking face and knows how to show it off too. Her body isn’t really in a bad shape, it’s just the angle. Many of the people might see and laugh at it, she must know that but her daring attitude is what’s most attractive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#4&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-173.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Daily LOL pics / Pinterest &lt;p&gt;This is one hell of a difference. The right picture shows that this girl is really pretty but the left picture, God. This is a kind of picture I would never even send to my best friend. Being honest, this girl has some guts to share her this kind of a picture. It looks nothing like her. Well maybe because all we can see is her chin and upper lip. LOL.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#3&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-174.jpeg&quot;/&gt;vvkivzhizni / vk   &lt;p&gt;Okay so first, it didn’t look like the girl on the left is the same as the girl on the right. She has some good contouring practice / experience. She has made her face look so slim in the left picture. The right picture is basically all of us in home. Dead looking with messy hair and bare face. She’s still beautiful as we know how she looks when she has a straight face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#2&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-175.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Nyyank257 / Pinterest &lt;p&gt;There is one hella difference between these two pictures. In the left picture, the girl looks pretty with her selfie face on. And the right picture, well that looks nothing like her. It’s still sexy to see how confident she is to share her left picture on the internet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#1&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-176.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tomasrdz3 / 9gag &lt;p&gt;This girl is so beautiful. She has the perfect face and has a strong selfie game. She might not be as slim as many other girls or have the 0 size body but she’s thick and that’s what guys want. Right? She’s confident and not at all ashamed of her body.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;What do you guys think of these comparison pictures? Do you have this much confidence of sharing your such pictures on the internet?
