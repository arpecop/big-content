Some may covet their fame and riches; their freedom, or the whole glamorous lifestyle. Other average folks, however, could live without all that. Still, they would love to have a typical celebrity body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, not all celebrities are in great shape. Most of them, though, take great care of their physical appearance. After all, for most of them, it‚Äôs their bread and butter. Ironically, this usually means no bread and butter for several celebs. Read on to find out how many calories your favorite stars consume in a day.

It‚Äôs trim, yet has its share of curves. Her total calorie count on an average day equals a nice 1,697 calories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She has a laid-back attitude overall, but her diet shows at least some care. For instance, she eats omelets with vegetables and antioxidant smoothies. She has even been known to have something like ice cream for dessert. The healthy rice version, anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other than this, she even allows herself a nighttime sundae at times. Her thinking is that it‚Äôs good to eat right, but it‚Äôs not the end of the world if you indulge sometimes. We couldn‚Äôt agree more!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Shay Mitchell‚Äôs healthy attitude&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2223-3-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Flickr &lt;p&gt;The beautiful Pretty Little Liars star gets in 1,456 calories every day. Most of these she gets from smoothies, green, and protein-rich item. For instance, a hard-boiled egg is a perfect snack. Vegetables and lean proteins make up her midday and night meals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like Alexandra Daddario, Shay Mitchell is no stranger to cravings and occasionally gives in to them. However, she definitely doesn‚Äôt do this too often, as her slim and toned features tell us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She has mentioned that her exercise and diet become stricter if a certain role requires it. Other than that, her saying is that food and exercise have to stay balanced. Hence, she would follow clean eating for the most part. If some fast food calls out to her, though, she‚Äôs not the one to deprive herself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Kim Kardashian‚Äôs protein kick&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2223-4-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Flickr &lt;p&gt;This reality TV star gets in around 1,500 to 1,700 calories on average. Most of this is some form of protein and very few carbs if any.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the way in which she has lost weight, she could release a diet book or program of her own! Since fans are excited to know every last detail about the Kardashians, a tell-all diet book should be in the works. It could happen sooner than expected. In the meantime, we have these tidbits for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kim started changing her eating habits when she wanted to shed some extra pounds after Saint‚Äôs birth. Her daily intake dropped to below eighteen hundred calories. The main thing she did was to cut out all the carbs in her then diet. She currently eats a variety of chicken dishes, along with cauliflower pasta and greens. Healthy, filling, and definitely not boring!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Jennifer Lopez‚Äôs portion control&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; the queen serving looksüíÖ #jlo #jenniferlopez #jlovers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by valeüôà (@lopez_vibes) on Sep 28, 2017 at 3:24am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Lopez‚Äôs daily intake is around 1,392. She looks to be in incredible shape and is probably only going to get better. Many celebrities, unfortunately, peak in their 20s and then start fading out. Lopez is definitely not one of them. The secret is probably in her low but healthy calorie intake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now in her late 40s, Lopez has managed to stay active and very much relevant for the modern world. She is an actress, singer, director, musician, and so much more. In addition to all this, she has certainly trained herself well in the matter of food.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is not to say that she survives on water and rice cakes. In fact, her eating menus are varied and sound quite yummy. She consumes fruit smoothies, chicken breasts, yams, greens, and kale salads. If need be, she would also indulge in little chocolatey treat. Needless to say, she probably keeps her portions quite small but big enough to fill her up. After all, she‚Äôs got a lot going on and needs the energy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One may also say that she has the right t indulge a bit more than others. This is because she gets in a whole lot of choreography practice. This is essentially cardio in a fun package. Hence, she would be burning off any extra calories she consumes in a few days, max.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Audrina Patridge‚Äôs healthy eats&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Having #310Shake for a mid-week pick me up!

This is not very far off from us common people may be consuming. Within the celebrity world, however, she is eating almost half as much more than other women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre happy for her to be eating so well and still managing to look incredible. Her diet is not composed of cheeseburgers and fries, but a healthy portion of good foods. Her breakfasts consist of oatmeal, almond milk and Greek yogurt. For snacks, she chooses nuts. A Greek salad makes up a delicious-sounding lunch. As for dinner, she usually has sushi or sashimi. A side of drink and some gourmet ice cream for dessert usually finish off her day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patridge is of the opinion that one should not deprive themselves. However, willpower and balance do make for a healthy and fit body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Julianne Hough‚Äôs routine for her dancer‚Äôs physique&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Hey guys, it&#39;s been a minute since I&#39;ve posted about my website and the fun tips and tricks I like to write about‚Ä¶. go check it out! www.juliannehough.com ‚úåüèº #Repost @juliannehough_com „Éª„Éª„Éª Before you retire your summer wardrobe, let&#39;s take a moment to remember the power of a classic jean jacket.

She actually documented her eating over the course of twenty-four hours a few times. This is mainly because her fans are so eager to find out how she gets her awesome physique.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically, she works out every day. Before starting, however, she drinks a whole lot of green juice. Later, she eats steamed eggs along with avocados and tomatoes. No toast required here! For a snack, she usually grabs smoothie from Harley Pasternak. The other two main meals both consist of filling but simple steamed salads. If that‚Äôs not enough, she usually goes for proteins like chicken breast or salmon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for dessert, she usually indulges in a few almonds covered in dark chocolate. Since her workout is quite demanding, she definitely deserves it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ayesha Curry‚Äôs delicious diet&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; I actually garden in pajamas.

She is married to Steph Curry, and usually takes in around 1,806 calories per day. She has some unique elements to her diet that you would definitely want to know about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the start of the day, Ayesha Curry usually wakes up to bulletproof coffee. It gets its name from the healthy ingredients added to it. These would be coconut oil, manuka honey, and ghee from grass-fed cows. She then has screened eggs along with some smoked salmon. Added to this is a side of cucumber avocado soup.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lunch is usually a grilled chicken breast with a side of broccoli, sweet potatos, and some quinoa. Salmon makes an appearance with rice at dinnertime, along with some yummy roasted veggies. She doesn‚Äôt skip dessert, either. What she has are some nice healthy berries with a blob of cream whipped to perfection. The cream shouldn‚Äôt shock us, as she eats balanced meals throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Jenna Dewan Tatum‚Äôs path to true beauty&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Balcony series continues ‚ô•Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Jenna Dewan Tatum (@jennadewan) on Sep 18, 2017 at 1:33pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jenna Dewan Tatum no doubt has an incredibly attractive husband. However, her physical appearance is no less so. She consumes a lot of vegan meals, which usually add up to about 1,431 calories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jenna Dewan Tatum is an actress as well as a dancer. Hence, she knows the way towards proper eating and maintaining a gorgeous physique. She is basically an animal lover and hence shuns all animal products. Hence, her meals are delicious and she eats without guilt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hence, her eating routine is filled with quinoa, cucumber-tomato salads, squash, zucchini, and several other vegetables. She also indulges in a yummy quinoa, black beans and veggies bowl. Chipotle sauce finishes off the dish, along with additions like corn and avocado.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Nicole Scherzinger‚Äôs clean eating&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Birmingham ‚úîÔ∏èThanks so much for your love and support #chosenbynicole&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Nicole Scherzinger (@nicolescherzy) on Sep 26, 2017 at 9:36am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nicole Scherzinger was formerly a part of The Pussycat Dolls. Now she performs as a solo artist. In order to keep up with concerts and costumes, she obviously had to strictly maintain herself. Her total calorie count per day is roughly 1,571 calories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, she generally eats lean, which counts for a lot. She is a lover of Greek yogurt, green juice, turkey, avocado, and gluten-free pasta topped off by tomato-basil sauce. No creamy or cheesy toppings for her! However, she does treat herself to some chocolate truffles at the end of the day. It‚Äôs good to know that she has human cravings too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes Nicole does feel the need to lose a bit of weight. When this is the case, she stops eating just before turning in for the night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lori Loughlin‚Äôs sticking to the staples&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; It&#39;s always a good day when I get to visit with @itshappythedog @hallmarkchannel üê∂‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Lori Loughlin (@loriloughlin) on Sep 14, 2017 at 8:44am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We loved Lori Loughlin on the 80‚Äôs sitcom Full House. Fans are pleased to know that her physical appearance hasn‚Äôt changed much since then. Much of this is probably due to her 1,261 calorie diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of Lori‚Äôs food comes from steamed veggies and protein portions. Other than that, she basically sticks to staple diet foods. These include oatmeal seasoned by cinnamon and nuts. She also eats apples, almonds, and grilled chicken breast. Green salad and grilled fish flanked by brown rice fill her up at other time. Dessert isn‚Äôt really in the picture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is what has worked for Lori so far. While this may seem a very difficult routine to follow, she asserts that this is what makes her feel good. If she eats unhealthy food, she automatically feels puffier and heavier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Protein and potato chips for Tracee Ellis Ross&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; ULYANA SERGEENKO ~ @ulyanasergeenko&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Tracee Ellis Ross (@traceeellisross) on Sep 25, 2017 at 11:13am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The popular mother on the sitcom Blackish, Tracee Ellis Ross consumes around 1,880 calories of food every day. Unsurprisingly, protein is a large part of it. Surprisingly, potato chips are also in the picture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tracee is known for her bold fashion statements onscreen and off. She compares eating to living life and maintains that both should be done joyfully. She drinks loads of water each day. Also in her diet plan are cereal, avocado toast, steak with salad, and boiled eggs. For snacks, apples, peanut butter, potato chips, and olives are the main deal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her eating is full of variety and delicious flavors. Plus, it‚Äôs nicely balanced and is clearly working for her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Kathy Griffin‚Äôs little treats&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Added Show!

This includes fast food for dinner sometimes. While she makes it clear that her age requires special care, she usually also jokes about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While touring, she sticks to energy-boosting healthy options. These include salads with chicken breasts, Cheerios with banana, coffee with skim milk, plus probiotic shots with a smoothie. She also enjoys avocados with olive oil and salt. Of course, some comfort food like a burger with a diet soda and salad sometimes helps her relax.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tiffani Thiessen with her cooking skills&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; I couldn&#39;t let today go without showing my support and love for #worldrhinoday We need to protect these gorgeous animals before it&#39;s too late. #rememberingrhinos #rhinolove #everyonematters buyrememberingbooks.com&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Tiffani Thiessen (@tiffanithiessen) on Sep 22, 2017 at 7:55pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tiffani was consuming around 1,083 calories when she was trying to tone down her baby body. However, since she does treat herself on her cooking show, she is probably getting a bit more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her routine otherwise consists of avocado toast, oven-roasted tomatoes, halibut with quinoa, protein shakes, etc. She also enjoys roasted veggie salads. While some find this diet to be too restrictive, she probably makes it all extremely flavorful with her cooking skills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;No secrets for Mel B.&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Can&#39;t believe my baby girl turns 18 today,Phoenix your my world your my everything,your such an amazing lady inside and out with a heart of gold,don&#39;t no how you turned out sooo good hahah,happy birthday my love,mummy&#39;s coming home next week to get you,then we celebrate ok #18todayüéâ #motherdaughter #workingmom&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Mel B (@officialmelb) on Feb 19, 2017 at 8:11am PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mel B. has really slimmed down. She consumes roughly 1,310 calories per day. This mostly consists of lean protein and greens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to this, she also works out every day. Her secret lies in moderation in everything she eats. This way, she even enjoys gummy bears! All she takes is one handful. Oatmeal along with a soy latte start off her day. Kale wraps, avocado toasts, green juice, and grilled chicken breasts are other staples of her diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Paleo all the way for Aisha Tyler&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; This is @johnhodgman. He is funnier than you or I. And his beard is beardier. Welcome to Hodgman&#39;s world. We&#39;re just barefaced in it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Aisha Tyler (@aishatyler) on Jul 22, 2017 at 1:01am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aisha Tyler has made a few tweaks in the Paleo diet. As such, she only consumes about 1,281 calories every day. This means that she avoid refined grains, sugar, dairy, and carbs. However, she does relax a little in her eating routine when her schedule isn‚Äôt so demanding. This is usually during the weekends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Breakfast consists of poached eggs, chicken breast, avocado, and veggies. Lunch is steak tacos and dinner has grilled fish with greens. With all the running about she does, all this must get burned off pretty fast.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Of course, it‚Äôs not just about the calories but the way they are consumed too. Limited the food groups one consumes is an amazingly effective way to keep a body trim. Celebrities know that, and so do their personal trainers. Whatever the case, though, one should not blindly follow celebrities in what they do. The best thing is to take motivation from their eating habits and starting a healthy eating regime for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Here‚Äôs How Much Calories Your Favorite Celebs Consume Daily for the Perfect Body","description":"An insight into the eating routines of 15 female celebrities."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/e/283f202ea58efd5960a8081f03b750de_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/e/303a61fdbc8c84afd296af3248d7608e_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"7 Warning Signs That Show Your Liver Is Full of Toxins"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/e/1f7b70840f839c07e67e2a3d644b1bde_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"8 Theories That Prove Time Travel Exists"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
