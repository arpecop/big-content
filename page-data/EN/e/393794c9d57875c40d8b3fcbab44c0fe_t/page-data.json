Every kind of questions start to pop up in you mind and you just cant help wondering like if he is really going to do it. Well nothing to worry about – the fact that worrying is quite natural and to be honest, it’s healthy for you somehow. And yeah of course you definitely deserve to be expecting a lifetime commitment. And you will, just don’t ask him directly whether he is thinking exactly what you are thinking. Because that might create some sort of awkwardness and you wouldn’t want, would you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What if I tell you that is a method of telling if getting married is one of the things on his mind or not, well if he is really thinking you as his wife in future or not: take hints from what he do and almost all his actions, if will directly reflect that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are the hints, which might only give you the hint but that will be the strong ones for sure. Look if your boyfriend has been acting upon these 15 things recently, and only then decide if you can see a marriage proposal coming your way any time soon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. He’s Saving Up Money&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2239-new-fol.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Not a long ago, your partner was somewhat a reckless spender. He wouldn’t care where his money was going, and almost every time he was the first one to offer to buy you anything or even when it came to buying something for himself he would just buy it, whether he needs it or not. However, now he is trying to change this habit of his and trying not to waste all that cash on those expensive items that are good for nothing. Well certainly there could be a lot of reasons behind the change of practice, one of which could be this that he is just making sure for saving up for the wedding that he is planning. He secretly hideaways money saying it’s for a rainy day!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. He Says ‘We’ a Lot&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2239-new-fol-1.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Whatever he speaks has a lot to say about what’s exactly running in his mind. Such as, whenever he is talking about something, which should normally just involves him, he still decides including you as well. Either it’s about going to an adventure trip or talking about buying a house, what you will notice is that he will be using ‘we’ rather then ‘me’. Back in his head, every main thing is done having you by his side, and quite naturally he just never forgets including you in anything as you are always on his mind. He just cannot imagine a life in which you are not there, and it’s very much obvious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. All His Friends Are Married&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2239-new-fol-2.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;One better thing that you can be doing for figuring out if he is really planning out to making you his future wifey or not is by analyzing his friends circle. If they are all married or getting married one by one and are perhaps quite happy about it. There are greater chances that your man also is planning something like that for joining the married men club very soon. Friends have a significant influence on your life, even if you have been planning different things in life, the stories of your friends will have the power for changing your mind and flowing their lead. If he is appreciative towards his the lives of his happily married fried and you guys usually go out for double dinner dates with those married friends of his than that’s it…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Values Your Opinion&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2239-new-fol-3.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;When someone starts to look at you differently, how they treat you also change. If your character in you man’s head is upgraded from his girlfriend to his wife, he will be putting this idea in his actions and whatever he do without even noticing. He will begin to include you in small and big matters of his life and he will want you to give him opinions on things, which genuinely matter a lot to him. Before taking any decision he will want to know what you have to say on it and then he will make his decision accordingly. He simply wants to makes sure of it that no matter what he do in his life it is somewhat acknowledged by you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Not Afraid To Open Up&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2239-new-fol-4.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;A quite visible sign of somebody being completely involved in you is them opening up to you about their personal life, their insecurities, their fears. Even if you see Dexter the serial-killer, putting Rita in suspicion until he finally accepted his inner-self and opened up himself to her emotionally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Him being all open about his feelings can’t straightforwardly mean that he has made up his mind of marrying you but it says a lot about the level of his trust whenever it comes to your relationship. He considers you as somebody who deserves knowing him as good as he does himself. Meaning that you are someone special and he may wish to keep you for life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. He Handles Your Crazy Like Nobody Does&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2239-new-fol-5.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;You are quite aware that your tantrums will get tackled in a way you want them to be tackled when it’s around him.

He Does Not Mind Shopping With You&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2239-new-fol-6.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;You will know that he is quite serious when the little things that you do or love doing make him wish to do it with you. Well no man ever agrees upon going for shopping unless he is genuinely and like totally into her. Mostly men that are not very much interested in their wives or girlfriends choose waiting outside the shops or will drop them off to the shopping mall. However, if your guy takes interest in what you are shopping and he helps you with it then it really means something else. And you really are special to him. He will help you pick stuff up and even while shopping he will suggest you what to buy and what will suit you the best. He will be there for you always, he is madly in love with you, and wishes to marry you.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;8.

Mobile phones, particularly say quite a lot about how much you trust the other person in today’s world. If you man has been open about almost everything and has never it necessary to protect his phone with any password, it shows that he genuinely trusts you. He is simply not afraid of anything, he probably has invested quite enough in you to keep you with him forever. You are aware about every about bit of his life.

Here what matters the most is that he has let you in, trust takes a lot of time to build up and you will definitely know when you have earned it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. He Believes in Your Dreams&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2239-new-fol-8.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;For a guy to love someone as much that they start thinking of marrying her, it’s essential that he knows everything that the woman he adores wants from her own life. It is very much needed for him to acknowledge your aspirations and dreams and not just that he has to believe in them as much as you do, simply because there is no logic in planning a life with somebody whose goals are not known to you, who has not enough value to make you a part of their plans and their goals. If he is a believer of your goals and your dreams and agrees to be holding your hand while you excel ahead in achieving them, he is definitely considering to make you his future wife.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10.

His Family Adores You&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2239-new-fol-10.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Family plays a significant role in the future of the both of you, or at least in defining if you both will be having a future or not. The face that you have met his family is evident enough for giving you a hint that this is not something temporary. And furthermore, if his family adores you then it’s even much better and there are greater chances for you to have a future with him. His mom and dad love you already that they will end up suggesting that both of you should get married.

No Money Problems&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2239-new-fol-11.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;There will definitely be money issues in regard to not having enough, but there will never be and money related conflicts, simply your money is his money and his money is yours.

And it works like this between him and you, it signifies that your relationship has enough understanding that even money, which is considered to be the greatest devil, doesn’t weakens it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, money needs to be spent sensibly and with caution should be from both ends, him helping you financially means that he considers you as somebody who is worth spending his money on which displays his matchless attachment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Future Talks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-29-9-2239-new-fol-12.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;He very casually tries asking you questions about your future plans. He wants to know what your dream destination for starting a family is and whether you like cats better or dogs as pets. And the discussion about future will be exchanged normally.

And not only by gifts, he is always trying to make you feel special in whatever way he can possibly. He will help you with laundry whenever you are feeling tired, setting up a hot bubble bath for you to relax, and cooking you delicious meals to come home to. He would do things, which he knows quite well will make you feel more desired and loved. He treats you like a queen simply because he know your worth in his life. He pampers you only because he really loves you and sees you as his future wife.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"15 Signs He’s Planning to Wife You in the near Future","description":"His gifts are exceptional; they are not always expensive but rather mean something."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/e/393794c9d57875c40d8b3fcbab44c0fe_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/e/425e82b3a03ad36f8e67c0643b1e103e_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"17 Rare Moments Where The Kardashians Were Actually Smart"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/e/303a61fdbc8c84afd296af3248d7608e_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"7 Warning Signs That Show Your Liver Is Full of Toxins"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
