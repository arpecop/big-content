You can inculcate habits that transform you as a person or you can build habits that destroy you. Same is true for relationships. You need to work on your relationship day in and day out. It requires effort and habits that encourage both the partners to come close in a marriage. Everybody wants a perfect relationship but without the effort. Building habits makes sure you can focus on your relationship even if you’re extremely busy and cannot think of activities to rekindle your love. Here are a few habits you can build to ensure that love amongst you never dies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Date nights&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-742.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;This is one the most important rules that will greatly benefit you and your spouse. Date nights don’t have to be in expensive restaurants every time. It’s setting aside a specific amount of time to focus on your spouse. Talk about what has happened during the weekend, if anything is troubling either of you and unwind. There is no ideal date night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Try doing something different every time. Research shows that the adrenaline rushes you experience after an adventurous activity is likely to help you come together and strengthen your bond. So, if you don’t have one, its time you start a similar ritual. If you already have a date night ritual, it’s time you spice it up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. A fight resolution mechanism&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-743.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Fights are inevitable. You are going to fight and have many arguments. What’s important is that you do not let them hold your relationship down. Develop a strategy, a rule or a process that helps you resolve an argument.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Conflicts are of two types: Constructive and destructive. With constructive conflict, your strategy would be different compared to when you’re in a destructive conflict.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such a mechanism also enables that you won’t hurt the person in the heat of the moment or refuse to apologize later due to egos. So, if you don’t have one, sit down today to develop one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Never stop flirting&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-744.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The beginning of the relationship is very different from the stage when you get comfortable with the other person. Beginning of a relationship is passionate, exciting and romantic. There is so much enthusiasm and a desire to impress the other person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you become comfortable with the other person, it is calm, steady and secure. However, passion should not go out of window. A way to ensure that you always feel the spark, is to never stop flirting. If you’re flirting, unconsciously you are imitating or creating the same energy as there was in the beginning of the relationship and it’s likely that the spark will live.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Do the dishes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-745.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Household chores need to be done every single day. If you live with each other, then the chores should not fall on one person. Yes, there might be days when one of the partners is visibly exhausted after a long day of maybe work. It’s ok to step in then to take charge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, for day to day you should switch it up amongst you and divide the work. So that both have less to do and you can spend some quality time together.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;5. ‘Feelings Friday’&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-746.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Have a day of the week where you sit and reflect about your emotions. Date nights are meant to excite you and help you engage in activities. A ritual like ‘feelings Friday’ is meant to cater to your emotional needs. In the book, ‘7 habits of highly successful people’ by Stephan R. Covey, he mentions a ritual of this sort that enabled him and his wife to address the unaddressed emotional problems and come closer because of that. So, go ahead have your ‘Stress-free Saturdays’ or ‘Feelings Friday’.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Travel together&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-747.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Traveling is exciting and helps you discover things about yourself that otherwise you could not.

If your partner had tried to dress up, appreciate them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compliment little things and gestures to make sure nobody feels underappreciated or unrecognized.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Be honest&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-749.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Just like it’s important to give compliments, it is also important that you be truly honest. From little trivial everyday things to when they genuinely ask you for advice, be honest. It is better for your partner to hear it from you that from some random stranger.
