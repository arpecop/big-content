Yes friends such a terminology does exist whether you like it or not. But yes there are etiquettes of wearing the rings as well. Rings can be used to make a statement by wearing them in style along with other accessories and let them do the talking.

Confidence shows how well versed you are with the style statement. The more confident you are the better it is and it gives a clear message to those looking at you about your personality. Moreover you should not fiddle much with it in order to attract attention and let people understand it themselves.

The fact that people will ask you about the additional rings cannot be denied. So yea that ring of yours has great potential to strike a conversation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-403.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;It is also important to note that each ring which you are wearing is giving out a silent message to those who are intelligent enough to understand it and have some knowledge about it. The engagement ring is usually worn on the left hands by both men and women. Since it is believed that the rings worn on the left hand represent the character and believes of the person. The right hand is the most widely used hand and thus it is considered as the physical hand while the left hand is considered as the mental hand. The following will be able to tell you the finger and the meaning if a ring is worn in there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-405.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;A person who wears a ring in this finger is usually giving out a “statement”. The rings worn on this finger are not connected in anyways to the culture and religion but they do attract a lot of wyes since they are isolated from the body. Some people who are interested in palmistry and astrology tend to connect the little finger with intelligence and having an influence on others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-407.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;The rings worn on this finger are usually the one worn on the wedding. The engagement ring is worn in the right hand’s ring finger while the wedding ring is worn on the left hand’s ring finger. The ring finger is often associated with the moon, as well as beauty and creativity, while it is also linked with the love relationships.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the moon’s metal is silver it is quite a natural choice for the non-wedding rings in the fourth finger.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-409.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Quite uncommon amongst many the rings worn on this finger signify that the person is feeling comfortable because it is central and manly. Also since this finger is connected to the index finger so it is advisable to wear something which is less heavy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-411.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;In this finger the rings worn are usually traditional ones like fraternal rings, and family rings. Since this finger is noticeable bigger rings can be worn on this one to make it more visible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-412.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;The thumb finger ring is usually linked to wealth. Since the rings worn on this finger are quite heavy and broad the association with an intimidating personality is natural. In mythology the ring worn in this finger is associated with strong character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-413.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;The third rule of wearing ring is to wear it according to the type of finger you are wearing it in. Smaller rings look nice and appropriate on smaller hands while bigger ones can be worn on the bigger hands. No all fingers should be filled with big rings otherwise these would not look nice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-414.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;The rule is to balance the rings while wearing the accessories while keeping it balanced as well. Moreover, the key is to keep in mind the accessories you are wearing because the rings should be worn in balance to other things in your hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overdoing it might just end up destroying your entire look. For example if you are wearing a watch in one hand and a small bracelet in the other hand then you can wear a big ring in the hand you are wearing the bracelet in. Filling all the rings in every finger with other accessories might end up looking like a total disaster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-415.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos     &lt;p&gt;It is also advisable to wear matching metals when you are wearing your rings according to your dress and accessories. Silver rings look really best with silver rings while golden rings look nice with the golden accessories and attire.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Rules to Wear Rings","description":"A lot of us are not aware of such a thing as “ring wearing etiquettes”.
