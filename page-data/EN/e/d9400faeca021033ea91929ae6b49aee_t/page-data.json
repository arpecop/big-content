Being passionate towards him is not enough. Guys love having a woman that has passion toward something else as well. This can be her career, her family and even her life. A passionate person has meaning in his/her life. What can be better than a guy looking adorably at his girl when she talks about her passion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Getting a little dirty&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2117.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Of course, guys like the girl that tends to get a little dirty in the bedroom. But unfortunately that is not the point of discussion here. We are talking about getting dirty in real life. Guys are considered as dirtier than ladies. And when a man finds a girl which replicates him in this respect, then he cannot resist. Girls that like hiking, biking, racing and other activities that can make them dirty; really hooks a man in.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;A slight touch&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2118.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Touching a man expresses your affection and makes him feel that you are not afraid of him and feel secure. Even the slightest of touches can hook him in. So if you are on you first date then try holding his hand or place your head on his shoulder. This will induce an electric current in his body and he will ask for more. Holding your man’s bicep makes him feel like a superman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Listening to what he says&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2119.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;A guy loves the type of girlfriend that can hear him out. After spending hours at office, travelling back home and managing affairs, a man feels stressed out. Even though men are emotionally strong, but they cry as well. If you listen to his difficulties and problems, and tell him that you have his back then he has 100% chances of getting hooked in. Guys never accept it but they need emotional support, and if they get that support from you then this can strengthen the chemistry between both of you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Trying new things&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2120.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;It is a part of female physique that they are always afraid of trying new things. Trying out new things in the bed form a part of this debate too, but we are specifically discussing the adventurous part. Guys always try out new things, they go out and have fun, and they want their girl to accompany them. We know that you are afraid, but trust your man and compromise. This compromise will force your man to think that you are the one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Being a low key&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2121.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;High maintenance girls are not considered as the best partners. We are not saying that it is a bad thing, of course everyone has someone there waiting for her. But if you remain with him in the home, watch a movie or a match, and have a small party with him alone. Then this thing can help you to catch his attention and rule his heart. Every man wants his life to be drama free and wants to chill out with his girl. So you should work on this part to live a happy relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;His friends love you&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2122.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;There is no rocket science involved in understanding that the guys weigh their friends more than anyone. A man listens to what his friends suggest him. So you must try to be in the good books of your guy’s friends. But make sure that you do not over-impress his friends. You are hooking the man, not his friends. And it is always good to know that his friends say well about you when you are not with them. This can make your man think that you are of his type, and he hooks in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Being ambitious&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2123.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com     &lt;p&gt;The think that we discussed earlier, the passion, is what draws man towards you like no other thing can. A man wants his girl to be hungry for want she wants. Striving and hardworking girls are way more attractive than the ones who are satisfied and sit idle. Ambition is the foremost thing that a man explicitly catches when a girl throws it at his. Talking about your ambition and the things that you want to do in your life can force him to get hooked in, whether intentionally or not.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"15 Little Things She Does To Hook You In","description":"Do you always fail to impress the guy you like?
