The audience already knows it is just some fake and make believe scene which is just trying to make us relate with it by seemingly realistic acting and often times great chemistry between the artists. After all they are ‘actors’ who are getting paid for their troubles. There should be no hint of any real love-making or intimate bonding amongst these performers on the camera right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well in one way or another some of the following scenes ended up being as real as it get. Something may have led to another and both the actors indulged in some real life action while the cameras were rolling. The more surprising thing is that these are some of the mainstream movies coming out of Hollywood involving some of the A-list actors of the industry. Some of them openly owned to the fact that they actually did it in front of the cameras while others were not so forthcoming about it. Call it commitment to their craft or simply raw attraction between both the actors which developed on set but they certainly produced a very life-like performance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Shia Labeouf and Stacy Martin- Nymphomaniac&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2350.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Creativecommons &lt;p&gt;Shia Labeouf apparently has bared all his clothes while the cameras rolled for the music video for Sigur Ros. Apparently his recent political activism and the iconic “JUST DO IT” motivational video may have been pointing towards the actor’s spontaneity to get down and dirty in front of the cameras. As he was no stranger to such requirements in the movie, Director Lars Von Trier seeing his potential starred him alongside Stacey Martin in the aptly named Nymphomaniac. Both the performers read the script and sensing that it may be too complicated to pull off their scenes with the help of CGI instead motivated each other to just do it! It is believed both the stars engaged in a real steamy love affair with physical act of making love that was not at all artificial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Robert Pattinson-Little Ashes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2351.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Creativecommons &lt;p&gt;Before becoming a heartthrob to millions through his role in the Twilight movie series as Edward Cullen, Robert Pattinson was getting in on some action in his role as Salvador Dali in the indie movie “Little Ashes”. It was required for him to act out as though his character is experiencing an orgasm. The actor wanted to pull off the scene as realistically as possible and later admitted to actually have started pleasuring himself for achieving that perfect shot, pun not intended. The expressions of his character are forever etched in the eyes of the camera for anyone interested to see Robert’s expressions during orgasm. Talk about commitment to your profession!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton-Monster’s Ball&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2352.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Creativecommons &lt;p&gt;In their critically acclaimed movie in 2001, Monster’s Ball starring the leads as Hailey Berry and Billy Bob Thornton made some headlines as to the intense love-making scenes. The story after all involved a romantic relationship between the two but their riveting performance had the audience curious about how much was acting and how much real life inspired. The steamy scenes were just too real to be passed up as just another acting performance from the duo. Infact Hailey further the speculation of the audience by admitting that their love-making scenes were too “animalistic” and they both decided to be as uninhibited with their bodies as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was widely believed that the whole production team and the cast decided to stay quiet on the matter and agreed never to talk about it too openly. Whatever the case maybe but this was an Oscar-winning performance from both. The authenticity of their indulgence with each other may have played some part in securing the coveted award.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie-Don’t Look Now&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2353.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Creativecommons &lt;p&gt;Another case of vintage era films with scenes packing enough naughtiness to start a debate of how much was real was the 1973 flick “Don’t Look Now”. The plot of the movie required both the leads starring, Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie, to engage in some steamy romance. The scenes captured on camera had many thinking that it was something way more than acting. They were required to depict having ‘fun’ time together but the scene dragged on and on and the director kept things rolling while the intense intimacy unfolded over the camera. The famous editor of Variety magazine, Peter Bart said on the matter “It was clear to me they were no longer simply acting…” and that was the case indeed. It was confirmed in the 2011 Bart’s memoirs where he happened to be on the production set and actually saw the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;5. Mickey Rourke and Carre Otis- Wild Orchid&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2354.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Creativecommons &lt;p&gt;Shot in 1989, it was a film which revolved around the two individuals who develop serious relationship with each other. Both the lead actors involved were required to do advanced roles as far as making intimate scenes was concerned. The story is about a woman played by Carre Otis who follows her career to Rio de Janeiro and end up having romantically drawn to Mickey Rourke. The intimate scenes in the movie exude real passion and about two socially well off individuals who have fallen hard for each other. The action is pretty much in line with the rumors surrounding the movie that the acting was not only wild but it was actually happening between Rourke and Otis. You can watch it yourself to believe us if you dare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Melvin Van Peebles- Sweet Sweetback’s Badasssss Song&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2355.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Creativecommons &lt;p&gt;As the name clearly implies, it was a Blaxploitation movie full of adult content and Melvin was required to depict an intimate scene on the set. It was primarily financed by Melvin himself as no studio was ready to sponsor it and produce it. He did step up to the role requirement and did get in on some of that action on the set. The shooting was done in an actual brothel of course and Melvin admitted that movie contained many un-simulated sex scenes. He later on admitted to contracting an STD during the production of the movie thanks to his overzealous obligation to the role. He was given workers compensation for his troubles in the movie and fortunately did not get any serious lifelong ailment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Anita Pallenberg and Mick Jagger- Performance&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2356.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Creativecommons &lt;p&gt;Anita Pallenberg is an Italian actress and model and apparently cover girl for entertainment industry in 1960s and 70s. Mick Jagger is an iconic rock star known for putting sex in drugs, sex and rock and roll. Apparently the two had feelings for each other on and off the set but they were most clearly depicted in their movie Performance shot in 1970. Both the actors were locked in some serious steamy sex scenes which were anything but acting. It was very much real and both were getting in on the action for real. Interestingly at the time when this movie was being produced Anita was the girlfriend of Mick’s band mate Keith Richards. This adds another dimension of infidelity to the whole affair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Notorious B.I.G-“Ready to Die” Music video&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2357.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Creativecommons &lt;p&gt;The above mentioned music video has some definite background noise in the audio which suggest the now dead rapper was getting some sort of oral sex. At the time Notorious B.I.G himself never commented on the situation and it was a matter left to speculations and theories. However recently the rapper’s cohort P.Diddy finally laid to rest all the rumors concerning the music video. He admitted that Notorious was definitely getting some action during the recording and filming of the music video and went on to say that he would not be ashamed of owning up to the fact if he was alive today. Well wrap your head around this piece of news!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Chloe Sevigny and Vincent Gallo-The Brown Bunny&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2358.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via Creativecommons     &lt;p&gt;Vincent Gallo director and actor always had strong feeling for fellow actor Chloe Sevigny. It was due to this sole reason the director starred the ‘coolest girl in the world’ opposite himself in the indie movie The Brown Bunny in 2003. He utilized his authority to serve his own desire to have some action with the starlet and there was one scene where Chloe is required to perform fellatio with Vincent. The movie critics were of the view that this will tarnish the young and aspiring actress’s career to such a point from where she will not recover but apparently she had a successful career of 20 plus years at the industry. Such criticism never affected her career in the slightest. The reasons behind how this could even happen are riddled with speculations as maybe they both had feelings for each other even off the studio. Chloe did admit to the authenticity of the scene by disregarding it as some CGI effect and admitted it to be the real deal. We know Gallo already came very clear about his feelings for Chloe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"9 Actors Who Actually &quot;Did It&quot; on Screen","description":"Actors who stopped pretending and started getting some real action on camera"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/e/d870d58814ee07b412584af096666d8e_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/e/d9400faeca021033ea91929ae6b49aee_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"15 Little Things She Does To Hook You In"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/e/cfa6fa3c7da2ae46f633f0c992107e6e_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"20 Unbelievable Coincidences That Leave Us With Many Questions About the World"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
