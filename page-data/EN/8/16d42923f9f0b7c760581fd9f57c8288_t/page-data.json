I’ve yet to see a valid explanation and I have no reason to doubt the victims’ accounts.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1647.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;The Republican hopeful has been accused of sexual misconduct by five women. What is more shocking still is that one of his alleged accusers claims that the incident happened when she was only fourteen years old and thus a minor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her statement clearly took her father off guard and is reported to have told to his aides present “Do you believe this?”  For his part Donald J Trump has stood by the Republican firmly. In response to the allegations against the senate candidate the President simply said Roy Moore has denied it. That in his view is sufficient proof of innocence when the person being accused of serial sexual misconduct with women and minors simply says that they did not do it according to Donald Trump that is all the proof he apparently needs.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1649.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Trump himself a man who has admitted to sexually harassing women in the best including one viral audio recording in which he told one of the Bush family scions to harass and assault women with impunity going to say that celebrity status meant that women would be okay with it and there would be no repercussions. Be it his spat with Megan Kelly on the campaign or his comments about women which have objectified and degraded women the President continues to remain unrepentant in his anti-women and misogynistic views.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The President of the United States continues to remain unchanged even though he is now in the oval office. In response to the wave of sexual harassment allegations that began to pour in especially after the Harvey Weinstein scandal. The President said that it was a very special time for women, however that being said he also does not seem to believe women who make allegations and has said even after the allegations against Roy Moore he would rather be in Moore’s shoes as opposed to his democratic opponent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately however the White House has said that at the very least the President will not be actively seen on the campaign trail to help Roy Moore win the senate elections. This has come as somewhat of a silver lining as it would not have beyond the realm of the realistic for Donald Trump to actively have hit the campaign trail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Had Trump hit the campaign trail it would not have only been an insult to women everywhere. The President could have been expected to actively side with Roy Moore and attack his accusers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first daughter is not the only person to have actively come out against Moore from the ranks of the Republican Party however. The party of Lincoln has managed to muster the courage to ask Roy Moore to drop out of the race. Many Republicans do not share in the views of the Trump Administration which sees Moore as key to keeping a razor thin majority in the Senate intact.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;The case of Roy Moore shows the moral quagmire that the Republican party now finds itself in. Even on such matters as serious as sexual misconduct there are Republicans who continue to put politics ahead of what is right. It is a moment for Republicans to rethink their priorities if they do not want to alienate even more voters, who continue to grow disillusioned with the values that the Republican has increasingly been supporting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Trump Annoyed with Ivanka over Her Suggestion There's a Place in Hell for Roy Moore","description":"The first daughter says that people like Roye Moore who prey on children should have a special place in hell and Donald Trump is very angry."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/8/16d42923f9f0b7c760581fd9f57c8288_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/8/23e9edcfd05ea5d6c83f60de18c31ff8_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Pilots Revealed 16 Nuances That Will Help You Become an Expert in Air Travel"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/7/fe7230e769670b91ea5b89e13db1bb67_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Ways to Make Your Partner Feel Important So Your Relationship Has a Chance"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
