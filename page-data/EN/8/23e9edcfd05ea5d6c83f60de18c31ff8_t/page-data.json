Airlines are no different. Though air travel is the safest from of travel, it still keeps secrets that it doesn’t want its passengers to know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thankfully we’ve got our hands on some amazing secrets that you probably didn’t know before. Who knows they might come in handy the next time you travel on an airplane. Knowledge is power. You just might as well surprise the crew and staff with your knowledge. So without further wait, here are some of the top aviation secrets you didn’t know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;16. Planes Fly in Curved Paths, Never Straight Lines&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-140.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Now sitting in an airplane, you may feel like you’re traveling in a straight line from point A to B with maybe a few turns but the truth is, you’re traveling in a curved path from point A to B. A plans almost never travels in a straight line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’ve been in a long flight, chances are you might have been shown the flattened world map with the flight’s trajectory on it. A plane flies either in a curved or a zigzag pattern. Iin case of an emergency, a plane is always near an airport hence to tackle the emergency situation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. Our Poor Pilots Are Not Allowed Not Keep A beard&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-141.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Ever wondered why most pilots walking around the airport never have a beard? The answer is because some airlines don’t allow them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reason is, in case of an emergency, a beard may hurdle the application of the oxygen mask on to a pilot’s face. Solution? Don’t keep a beard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. Cabins Are Chilled To Increase Your Chances of Survival during Emergency Situations&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-142.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;If you travel through air often, you must have wondered why cabins are so cold. This is because a connection exists between temperature and pressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hot air may cause unconsciousness. This can be prevented by cooling the cabin. Pretty smart no?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Ordinary People Can Never Land a Plane&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-143.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Sorry to break it down to you but ordinary people like us can never land an airplane. We just can’t. Unless we’ve attended flight school. Not only landing an airplane is requires skills &amp;amp; precise knowledge of the instruments, a person that has no knowledge will never be able to land the aircraft.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let alone stress would cause him to fail. Guess those Hollywood movies with passengers saving the day weren’t so accurate after all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Better Wear Shoes On Flights!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-144.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Yes slippers are very comfortable and cozy but will they protect your feet from harsh weather, debris and broken glass in case of an emergency?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exactly, wear some good shoes on flights then.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Turning Off Your Electric Devices Wouldn’t Save The Day But It Will Ease The Pilot’s Work&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-145.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;“If you don’t shut off your device, the plane will crash”, we’ve all heard this in the past at some point. The truth is it wouldn’t but if you leave your devices on, it can interfere in the pilot’s communication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Imagine trying to communicate with air traffic control while 100’s of cellphones are interfering to catch a signal. Sucks right? Don’t do it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Flight Attendants Equally Hate Delays As Passengers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-146.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Thought you were the only one affected from a delayed flight? Flight attendants are equally affected. They are only paid for their flight hours. Time spent on ground does not count.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Max the airlines offer is some allowance for every hour spent on ground. So next time don’t be mad at the cabin crew. They probably hated the delay more than you did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Pilots Take Toilet Breaks In Turns&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-147.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;This is no brainer. Of course you wouldn’t want an empty cockpit while both of your pilots are in the lavatory. Sounds like a disaster in the making. Pilots take turns and while one pilot is out, a flight attendant goes into the cockpit and waits for the first pilot to come back. Respectful right?&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;The main reason behind this etiquette is to prevent the first pilot from being locked out in case the second pilot faints out. Genius!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. There Isn’t Anything Wrong With Airplane Food, It Is With You&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-148.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Now this may seem awkward but the food served on an airplane is actually good and there is nothing wrong with the taste. At high altitudes, your taste buds don’t function as well as they do under normal conditions. Humidity, and pressure also plays an important role in ruining your appetite. Science!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Don’t Be So Formal&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-149.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Of course you’d look classy wearing a suit on a flight but try being informal on flights and opt for something much more comfortable and breathable like loose fitting. This is very helpful during long flights where formal clothing may affect the quality and time of your sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to bring a sleeping mask and a neck pillow. Thank us later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Pilots and Crew Communicate Through A Bullet-Proof Door&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-150.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Yes, the cockpit door is bulletproof to protect the pilots in case of a hijacking and they could land at the nearest airport. Moreover the door is also protected by a security code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The crew has to check in on the pilots every 40 minutes during day flights and every 20 minutes during night flights to make sure everything is alright. Just a precautionary measure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. The Most Comfortable Spot is Near Or Over the Wing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-151.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;“The most comfortable spot on an airplane” has long been in debate and finally we have the right answer, it’s near the wing. Yes. This is because the seats in the back are very uncomfortable and rocky.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most comfortable place is in the middle so next time you plan to travel, choose the middle seating and thank us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Pilots Have A Special Way To Warn The Airport In Case of A Hijacking&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-152.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;This is actually quite genius. In case of a hijacking, a pilot cannot communicate directly with the airport and tell them what’s going on in the airplane. That is where this trick comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In case of a hijacking, a pilot leaves the plane’s flaps up while landing to warn the airport that something is wrong so that the emergency services can be contacted immediately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Cabin Lights Are Dimmed Intentionally At Night&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-153.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Yes they also help you sleep but the real reason why the cabin is dimmed at night is so that in case of an emergency landing, the passengers eyes are already accustomed to the dark and they can navigate correctly in dark and evacuate as quickly as possible. Genius!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. A Hard Landing Is Actually A Skilled Landing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-154.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Every felt a bad bump during landing and wondered why is the pilot even allowed to fly? Well, this is exactly why he’s a certified pilot. Hard landings are sometimes intentional when the runway is wet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pilots have to land hard so that the tyres can tear through the layer of water and prevent a phenomenon called aqua-planning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Oxygen Masks Are Only As Good As 15 Minutes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-155.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;In case of an emergency, Oxygen masks are life savers. But since they can hold oxygen for 15 minutes, you should start praying to god the minute the oxygen masks fall down. Luckily, 15 minutes are enough for the pilot to descend to a breathable altitude.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pilots are the true unsung heroes, hundreds of lives depend on them and they get the job done effortlessly. More respect to the pilots.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Now since the beans are spilled, let us know which one of these facts you did not know before and which one for you was the best of the lot.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Pilots Revealed 16 Nuances That Will Help You Become an Expert in Air Travel","description":"Every workplace has its secrets, some small, some big but secrets are secrets and we don’t want anyone from the outside knowing them, right?
