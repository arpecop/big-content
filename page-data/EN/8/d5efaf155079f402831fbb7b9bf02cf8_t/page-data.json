The intentions behind her campaign was to drive Chennel crazy to the point where she would eventually move out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the local police authorities, they arrested and charged Brochu with criminal mischief, breach of peace and intimidation based on bigotry. Although she is out on bail, but she has also been expelled from University of Hartford, where she was on a $20,000 a year scholarship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shocked, and horrified, Chennel went to Facebook to explain how things unfolded.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So this is what happened….&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Posted by Jazzy Rowe on Monday, October 30, 2017&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the video, distressed Chennel describes how she suddenly starting feeling sick, and was constantly given a cold shoulder by Brochu.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It started with throat pain,” she explained. “I thought maybe because it’s colder up here, I’m just catching a cold. After a month it got to the point where I had extreme throat pain that I couldn’t sleep, to the point where I couldn’t speak.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chennel claimed that she was surviving on her own money sent from her parents. The medical center in the campus wasn’t free, and was also heavy on her pocket. Her tests would come back negative despite the antibiotics prescribed by the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;When the relationship between the two intensified, Chennel decided to move out. Chennel claimed that Brochu’s behavior with her continued to worsen. She would walk in her room and turn off the lights when Chennel would be working.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just when she was about to move out, Chennel discovered series of Instagram post which left her in shock.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Brochu had posted the following:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-281.jpeg&quot;/&gt;dailymail &lt;p&gt;Chennel later found snapchat photos of Brochu where she was tampering with her personal stuff to make her sick. One of the photos showed bloodstains form used tampon on Chennel’s bag.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-282.jpeg&quot;/&gt;thetabb.com &lt;p&gt;This picture of a tupperware box with the caption, “Like this is moldy clam dip and I’ve been mixing it with her face lotion.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-283.jpeg&quot;/&gt;thetabb.com &lt;p&gt;Chennel also claimed that their University could have handled the case more efficiently. She had the intentions to immediately press charges against Brochu, but nothing could be done until the School’s public safety had finished its investigation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;President Greg Woodward of The University of Hartford stepped up to condemn the incident and called it a deeply upsetting incident of bullying.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;@onlyelimori_ Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.
