This letter was addressed to his mother a mere day before the unfortunate incident in which the liner struck a massive iceberg and met its demise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The man behind the letter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Holverson was an affluent a salesman and was one of more than a staggering 1,500 passengers and crew who died on board when the iconic Titanic sank on the unfortunate day of 15 April 1912. His body was recovered from the Atlantic Ocean several days later, and his personal belongings were sent back to his brother who resided in Minnesota, US. These possessions included a personal pocket notebook, which was heavily water-stained, in which was folded the letter, waiting to be sent.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of Eerie Coincidences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fact that the first-class passenger Alexander Oskar Holverson hand wrote a letter, that too on official Titanic stationery, to his mother just a day before disaster struck and  the ship that was previously thought to be invincible struck is nothing short of a miraculous coincidence. This tragic accident, the legendary Titanic hitting  an iceberg in the North Atlantic and sinking to it’s untimely demise led to the deaths of over 1,500 people. In what can be assumed to be his last and most important letter, Holverson described the ship that would soon become his final resting place as “a giant in size and fitted up like a palatial hotel.” Sends chills down your spine, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The letter, which till this day retains moisture in the form of  saltwater stains from the day it plunged into the waters, shares a spooky insight io the joyous moments that preceded what is considered to be one of the most historic tragedies of all time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details of what this historic letter actually contained&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In his monumental letter, Holverson mentions the richest man on the ship, named John Jacob Astor and wryly comments on how he looks like any other man. He appreciated the standard of food and wine on the ship and in what can now only be perceived as a rueful comment, he writes of his arrival, which of course never happened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Holverson perished in the Titanic, his wife, Mary Alice, managed to pull through the disaster and survive. The letter written by her husband is believed to be one of the last surviving pieces of correspondence from the Titanic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talking about the letter’s current market value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The auction house responsible for auctioning this letter, named Henry Aldridge &amp;amp; Son, is especially known for its specialization in Titanic memorabilia. They dubbed this recent discovery as the most important piece of what is left of Titanic to ever be auctioned. An auctioneer named Andrew Aldridge said in an interview that he was beyond joyous about this discovery and the starting bids are testament to the fact that this is indeed the most important letter to be recovered from the Titanic disaster.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;This letter is presumed to be the last letter written on board of the Titanic by a soon to be victim. Around two years ago, a letter written by a fellow passenger, named Esther Hart, sold for a massive £119,000. Auctioneers believe that Holverson’s letter will exceed this amount.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"A Letter Written Mere Hours Before the Titanic Sank Has Found and Fetches Record £126,000 at Auction","description":"The letter contains the poignant prediction that “if all goes well we’ll arrive in New York on Wednesday” ."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/8/fd3861c9e2aa13e0c395b33b1609abf8_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/9/039b471beb91c3878ed7b9a30f7c95a9_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"19 medicine free stomach ache remedies you never knew about"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/8/f9be93be4870b7e6ab9070f5ae63c5e8_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"6 Signs a Girl Gives When She Wants You to Talk to Her!"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
