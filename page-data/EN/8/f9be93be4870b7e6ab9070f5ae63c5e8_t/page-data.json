Some of these ways are direct and some are indirect, but what about those men who don’t have the confidence to approach someone and miss a great opportunity to get to know a great person who could be the one for them due to the fear of rejection? The easiest solution to this is either getting over your fear or having some sort of leverage to not fear the action of approaching the girl at all. If the first option is out of question then the latter one can always come into play.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you do like a girl, knowing that she likes you is good for your confidence level and the possible fear of rejection also dissipates!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So without any further ado, here is a list of signs that tell you if a girl wants you to approach her:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;When she smiles at you without using her lips&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2034.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Lips are not the only part on your face that can move. Your eyes, your forehead and even your eyebrows can line in a way that makes you look like you are smiling even when your lips aren’t doing it directly. Wondering why she is not using her lips to smile at you? For her that might be too direct hence she improvises by using her eyes to smile at you, schooling her expression to look warm and inviting without seeming too inviting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;When she plays eye hockey with you&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2035.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The first thing you need to identify here is the difference between glaring and looking. If she is glaring at you it is safe to assume she wants you to stay far away from her, but if she looks directly into your eyes for a while and does not look away, she is clearly trying to tell you something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eye contacts are known to be very intimate, and used to incite and connect a feeling of passion to the other person. Is she trying to catch your eye? Well with the given explanation, she probably likes you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;When any part of her lingers on you&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2036.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;If both of you are in some sort of gathering and are already at a point where you talk to each other, that still does not hit the bulls eye that this article has been glaringly been pointing at. If she likes you and even if you both are on speaking terms, there are signs she wants you to approach her in a romantic fashion. For this you need to be able to distinguish between friendly touches and the not just friendly touches.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If she really likes you all her gestures will be magnified and drawn out. Brushing her hand against your shoulder, shaking hands with you, her gaze on yours and other moments like this have the ability to show you that she likes you more than a friend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;When she is always in close proximity with you&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2037.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Have you ever deliberately stood near someone for no reason if you did not even like them? Well using our common sense here if the girl has positioned herself for easy access of physical contact or conversation and is not doing it herself means she wants you to do it for her. At a gathering and keep turning around to see her not that far behind is her giving you a chance to just approach her and initiate a conversation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t blow it, grab it while you can because soon she might just tone it down to the point of invisibility because she was bound to feel awkward about it sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;When she laughs at your jokes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2038.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Every other girl likes spending more time with a guy that makes her laugh, if you evaluate how many girls want a sense of humor in their potential half’s personalities you would be surprised. Sometimes they laugh even when you did not say anything funny the butterflies in their stomach might just tell them otherwise. If the girl laughs at your jokes and gives rapt attention to every word that comes out of your mouth, then there is a possibility that she might really like you.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;When she uses subtle ways to get your attention&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2039.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;This is the easiest to spot and the clearest of all the signs yet. The girl in question might have an attitude that says unapproachable or it could be ‘approach me now’. If it is the latter then there are several situations that could come into play.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She is sitting with someone she might laugh louder than she actually does, if she is sitting alone she might raise her book or magazine to a point where it does not hide her face but is enough to show you the title of her book so it might become a conversation starter for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;When she plays with her hair&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2040.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;When a girl plays with her hair there are several reasons and several ways the action can take place that tell us why she is playing with them. She might pat it down discreetly trying to make sure she looks nice in case you are looking at her, if she is twirling it around her finger it can be an unconscious but flirtatious gesture, the last but not the least running her hand constantly through her hair could mean that she feels nervous in your presence another indicator she likes you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;When she fakes it&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2041.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Now here comes the not so subtle attention seeking where she really thinks she is being subtle. Pretending to feel sick in front of you so you could either offer her assistance or ask her how she feels, pretending she can’t change her tire so you might offer to change it for her or give her a ride home, pretending to be very hurt after stubbing her toe even though it was not a big deal in the first place so you could ask her if she is okay or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do all these scenarios have in common? Her hoping for a conversation starter or her hoping for some time alone to start a conversation. That clearly shows us she likes you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;When she is nervous around you&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2042.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Unless her future well-being depends on you or she is always a nervous wreck she probably has no reason what so ever to be nervous in your presence unless she has a really big crush on you. She could be constantly be fidgeting with something in her hands or twisting her fingers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She might trip over her words in hopes of finding the right ones so she can blow your mind and not seem like an idiot in front of you. You want to impress people you like right? Well the same goes for her, she is nervous about not making a good impression in front of you. It is like an anxious child giving an exam, marking all the MCQ’s wrong while desperately trying to pass.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;When she makes it a point to check you out&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-2043.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Although men are more open in conveying who they like and who they don’t some women can be indirectly direct as well. There are stages of checking a guy out. The first one being the customary glance where you appraise the person for the first time, evaluating if you like the way they look or not. The second time is when she hears you speak and looks at you again in hopes of viewing you in terms of looks and personality.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;The third and the final stage is when after appraising you for both your layers she does it a third time showing she likes what she sees and wants to keep seeing it again. If a girl has given you more than 3 glances, there is a very strong possibility she likes you.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"6 Signs a Girl Gives When She Wants You to Talk to Her!","description":"Caught a girl’s eye and wonder if you caught hers as well?
