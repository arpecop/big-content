Judges and the audience are treated to unusual stories and incredible demonstrations of skills and talent. 27-year-old Emma Haslam was one of such contestant who came to the show with her 3-year-old. But watching her walk on stage in a tight costume and standing next to a pole left the judges wondering, considering she was a size 18.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emma was auditioning for her dancing skills. But unlike regular dancers, she wasn’t thin, nor did she have toned muscles for a pole dancing performance. Judges had some genuine concerns about Emma and her performance. But Emma’s persistence and willingness to prove that big girls could handle the performance equally well compared to thin girls convinced the judges to give her a shot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Judges and the audience were definitely in for a surprise!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-379.jpeg&quot;/&gt;fabbiosa.com &lt;p&gt;Emma’s incredible performance left the judges in awe! She successfully pulled the crowd with her incredible confidence and pole dancing skills. But behind her exceptional dancing skills, what most resonated with the crowd was her message she wanted to put out to the world. She was on stage to challenge stereotypes and break them with her excellent skill and talent. Despite her weight, her flexibility and lightness was on spot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-380.jpeg&quot;/&gt;fabbiosa.com &lt;p&gt;Emma Haslam wowed the judges with her pole dancing, body confidence and a bold message.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-381.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the show, Emma Haslam said,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-382.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Emma’s determination to perform and incredible skills got her to semifinals before she was knocked out of the completion. Now Emma is an aspiring pole dancing trainer, and is happy how things turned out for her.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Me and my awesome pregnant friend @leahdwalters #polefitness #emmaspoledancing #splits&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Emma Haslam OToole (@emmaspoledancing) on Nov 10, 2016 at 6:46am PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The contestant on “Britain’s Got Talent” also landed a gig as plus size model.
