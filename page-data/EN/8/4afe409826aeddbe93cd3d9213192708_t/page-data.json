The family is known for staying in the news, the weirdest controversies, drama and the fact that most of it originates from Kris herself. Yes you read that right. Most of the happenings of her children‚Äôs life happen because Kris orchestrates them herself. Her motive of doing this are gaining publicity as well as some top rating for the show which she has been able to achieve by the drama created in their lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Kardashians family started when Robert Kardashian married Kirsten Mary Houghton also known as Kris. They had four children together Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Rob but they got divorced in the year 1991. Kris ended up remarrying retired Olympic decathlon Champion Bruce Jenner and they couple had two daughters together Kendall and Kylie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After Robert died in the year 2003 the Kardashian family started making a lot of public appearance and the sisters also started making news. In 2007 Kris decided to have her won show which was to be focused on her family and Ryan Seacrest agreed to air the show in October 2007.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Kardashians started to be involved in more controversies as soon as the show started airing which made Kardashians the household names! So yes let‚Äôs see how it all worked well for the family!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Kourtney getting pregnant&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Happy #nationalsisterday&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by @kardashians on Aug 7, 2016 at 6:58pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although Kourtney got pregnant by her on and off boyfriend Scott Disick Kris was happier that it would increase the ratings for the show.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She even went to accept the fact that this happening helped save the show by creating the viewer‚Äôs interest which was otherwise dying. Many said the fact that Kris is so happy hints towards the fact that she was the one who made it all happen to gain publicity. Seems like she suggested to Kourtney that getting pregnant by an unstable boyfriend might be good for the brand!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The plastic surgeries&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; 9pm #KUWTK&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by @kardashians on Jul 3, 2016 at 5:33pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seems like the family is striving its best to look similar to each other. This trend has been started by Kim. This is evident from the fact that her nose appears all different now as compared to the time when the show started. She denies having getting done any of it and says that the before and after pics are not true, in fact according to her the ‚Äúafter‚Äù picture is really taken before. She believes it is the magic of contouring of the nose that it appears different than it was before! Also for many years she denied getting anything done at the backend but recently she accepted that she got cortisone shots in her bum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not only her but Khloe has also been there. She has changed drastically over the past years, she has undergone some serious transformations. According to many people she seems to have got her nose done, lip injections and cheek fillers as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kourtney and Kendall are the ones who have got the least work done, thus they look quite natural unlike the rest of the clan who looks quite fake. Many also think that Kylie Jenner has also got her lips done. But she denied in a recent news and said that her fans have watch her grow up since she was nine years old and is now an expert in her makeup which makes it look like she has got work done on her. Although later she accepted having temporary lip fillers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Kylie and Kim‚Äôs resemblance&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; GQ party! @kimkardashian, makeup by @makeupbyariel, hair by @cesar4styles&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by @kardashians on Jun 29, 2016 at 7:08am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To add to the surgery controversy, the youngest of the family has started to resemble Kim a lot now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although they are half-sisters but the resemblance is just quite creepy, which could be partly due to genes and also due to seeing the same plastic surgeons! The early days of Keeping up with the Kardashians the sisters did not even look alike but now they could be passed as twins. Wow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Relationships&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; On KimKardashianWest.com&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by @kardashians on Jul 9, 2016 at 6:46am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though the sisters are always having suitors, who are desperately waiting for the sisters to be in their lives they have failed to have lasting relationships. Kim who is married for the third time now, the first one being when she was 19 years old to Damon Thomas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The marriage however could not survive, ended after three years the reason which Kim presented was that he abused her and wanted her to get liposuction done. Her second marriage was to Kris Humphries who was an NBA player.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Happy 2 year anniversary #kimkardashiangame @kimkardashian Art by @cfranca_art&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;A post shared by @kardashians on Jun 25, 2016 at 12:37pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The wedding was quite a special one and was also celebrated on the show but sadly it ended in four months only. It was Kanye West whom Kim started to date and made it look&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;like she finally found love! But recently the couple has not been seen together in public for quite some time now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kanye has had a mental breakdown and was hospitalized while Kim got robbed off in her hotel room in Paris, rumors are that the two are divorcing. Although the couple are having a child now through a surrogate but are not as lovey dovey now as they used to be before.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; ‚ù§üòç&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by tyga and kylie (@tyga._kylie) on Aug 30, 2016 at 9:32am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kylie and her Ex-boyfriend Tyga were very much in the news when they were in a relationship. But it did not last longer due to many reasons. The first being the age difference which was quite large between the two of them. Secondly, this relationship got very weird when Kylie‚Äôs brother started dating Tyga‚Äôs ex with whom he had a child. Although Kylie and Tyga‚Äôs relationship was very public and lasted many years before it ended.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Edit! @khloekardashian @lamarodom&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by KHLOE and LAMAR (@khloeandlamarodom) on Jan 31, 2015 at 8:39am PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Khloe was seeing Lamar Odom who was the former LA Lakers Player. The marriage was again quite celebrated in her own show as well but this marriage also did not last. Lamar was guilty of cheating on Khloe and was also a drug addict. Although he later admitted in his interview that he regretted cheating on Khloe.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Kourtney And Scott (@kourtneykardashian_scottdisick) on Mar 24, 2017 at 4:11pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The oldest sister Kourtney has had the longest yet the most unstable relationship with Ex-boyfriend Scott Disick. He has even appeared on the show several times. They have had three children together Mason, Penelope and Reign. Since Scott is unable to let go off his partying ways the relationship has never been stable.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Feels like it was yesterday! #familyfirst #kardashians #missyou ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Rob Kardashian (@robbert_kardashian) on Sep 30, 2017 at 4:43pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kris has also been in the spotlight for the relationship she has had.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The one with Bruce was quite a happy one until they separated after being married for 23 years. When Bruce transformed in to Katilyn, Kris was very disappointed because of the way her former spouse portrayed her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rob has had the worst relationships fails in the entire family. He first dated Adreinne Bailon the Cheetah girl but later the relationship ended because he started cheating on her. After this he started dating Angela Simmons but the two of them also could not last for long.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then it was the singer Rita Ora and after two months it was found that she was cheating on him with twenty guys! This began the depression journey for Rob and then Blac Chyna came in to the scene. She was the ex-girlfriend of Tyga. Although Blac and Rob got engaged but it just lasted three months after they called off the engagement but still had a beautiful baby girl in December.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of this is believed to be a stunt to get the rating up for the show! I mean dating the ex- girlfriend of the younger sister‚Äôs boyfriend is surely a well-thought out plan for the ratings!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Khloe not a Kardashian&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; üòú&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Khlo√© (@khloekardashian) on Nov 29, 2017 at 2:07pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes this is the most interesting controversy the family has had. This is because the time Khloe was conceived Kris and Robert were not on good terms. It was also rumored that during this time Kris was having an affair with soccer player Todd Waterman so it is believed that she was cheating on Robert.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;The fact that Khloe is a bit different from the rest of the siblings confirms the fact that she did not belong to the Kardashian, but Robert has never took any DNA test to confirm the same.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Something Curious Is Happening to the Kardashians","description":"The Kardashians family is one family the world cannot imagine living without.
