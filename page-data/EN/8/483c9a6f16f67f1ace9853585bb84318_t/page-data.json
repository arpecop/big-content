A name coined in the early ages, this person is one who suffers from one of the worst and most silent yet lethal killers of all time – chronic negativity. Not only does this consume the person as fast as fire does wood, it has many medically proven complications to its name which can lead to short term and long term issues that hamper the abilities of not the individual but also society at large. This article seeks to address some of many demerits and harms of chronic negativity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Grey thoughts in the grey matter equal grave consequences&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2172-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Constant negativity can elevate levels of stress in the human body and this, in turn, results in the generation of Cortisol. Though rather timid in its own right, Cortisol is notorious for the excess generation of the neurotransmitter known as Glutamate, which keeps on stimulating the production of free Oxygen radicals. Just as an exposed piece of metal rusts due to constant exposure to Oxygen, these radicals kill brain cells by puncturing their membranes causing them to rupture and consequently die. Perhaps what is more alarming is that high levels of Cortisol catalyze the demise of these cells which are already in jeopardy because of reasons such as unhealthy diet, which could be a common factor in a person who is constantly negative due to raised levels of stress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;More mood swings&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2172-2-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Negativity entails the person constantly living in a downed state where neither the colors seem bright nor does the food ever taste as good. Mood swings are a daily ritual for Debby because there is the constant feeling of nothing good ever coming from anything on one hand and the temporary yet very refreshing burst of happiness when things go right on the other. Always at emotional crossroads even after something pleasant happening, Debby is bound to lay in wait for the next worse thing to come.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What was that thing with the…?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2172-3-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;ShutterStock &lt;p&gt;Lost your pen again? Where did you put your phone? Where is the nearest fuel station when you need it most? Well, you would have remembered better if you weren’t so negative, studies show. As per the white coats, factual memories weaken and you tend to lose track of the brighter side of things for being so down in the dumps all the time. This makes the electrical signals coming to and from your brain’s hard drive weaken to the point of pummeling you into greater medical complications which are usually experienced in old age. Young Debby may look 25 but is mentally 75 already.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;It’s all your fault!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2172-4-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;ShutterStock &lt;p&gt;Holding another person accountable for your misfortune is what amounts to blaming them, and this is exactly what desperate Debby does daily. Self-victimization is the product the blame factory churns out and is basically a coping mechanism for denial and self-hatred. Undoubtedly, the reason for some unpleasant events is merely just ‘life’, but Debby seeks delight in blaming anyone else for what could even potentially have been avoided, had it not been for her own negativity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why can’t I do as good as her?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2172-5-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Ah, the killer of all true happiness. Chronic negativity is known for inciting jealousy and unhealthy self-comparison in people of all ages and genders for the simple reason that you just never feel good enough. Debby always knows a storm is stirring and headed her way and is always hateful for the people who apparently have no bad luck. The truth, however, is that being chronically negative, you are highly likely to make self-defeating decisions that place you way behind the competition. The only person holding you back from true happiness, it turns out, is you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;I just hate myself!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2172-6-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;ShutterStock &lt;p&gt;We all make mistakes in life and it is best to look at such regretful moments in the context of everything else in the surrounding. Unless you’re Debby because the reason she doesn’t forgive herself for that one wrong box she ticked at the quiz which rounded her grade down is her chronic negativity. Not only does her ability to concentrate in the now suffer instrumentally, but her self-forgiveness seems absent too. This can make her develop suicidal tendencies if her self-loathing is not brought to an end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Depression and dopamine&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2172-7-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Remember when we talked about those brain cells dying? Well, it turns out, there is more than meets the eye when this unfortunate demise occurs. The human nature is responsible for making the average person do more of what they like simply because the brain’s reward centers are more stimulated when the person does the said act. This varies from person to person and sometimes what is painful for you, such a hot steaming bowl of Chili may be pleasurable for your friends who just can’t have enough. Debby, sadly, feels no pleasure because the feel-good hormone, Dopamine, just doesn’t work as it should in her body because of inefficient brain cells. Nothing seems rewarding, hence nothing is worth doing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sorry from the Serotonin&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2172-8-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Serotonin is the happy hormone that controls more than just the smile on your face. Also responsible for appetite, sleep, and learning, Serotonin plays a vital role in our daily lives. Sadly, the functioning of this too is hampered because of the death of the many brain cells. Loss of Serotonin in the system can have dire consequences as even all-time favorites just don’t feel so fun anymore and it sends the person desperately fishing for a new source of happiness. Studies show that low Serotonin levels in women have triggered binge eating, anxiety, and depression. Men, on the other hand, are in a no better of position as low Serotonin is known to cause addiction to intoxicants such as Alcohol, and cause severe ADHD as well as impulsive control disorders.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;Error: No thoughts generated&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2172-9-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Chronic negativity can make your brain seize up all of a sudden – which calls for very embarrassing moments at times. A job interview, a quiz or an inquiry someone at work makes into your life, your mind may not be playing for your team at the time. Basically, a fight or flight mechanism which the human body has naturally, this suspension exists so you can make a timely decision. For Debby however, that is never the outcome because she’s too afraid and too negative, needless to say, to make a decision for her best interests because she’s simply terrified of the ‘guaranteed’ negative outcome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Taking toxins to the head&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2172-10-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Think we’re done listing the damages your brain is in for? Bad news, the list is virtually non-exhaustive. Unfortunately, another unpleasant entail of the negativity package is the weakening of the blood-brain barrier which becomes permeable. Something that is literally deadly, chronically negative people have very delicate barriers which separate the brain from the poisons that are the heavy metal molecules, pathogens, and other toxins. This can lead to brain cancer, brain infections and sclerosis in some cases. Yes, this is no joke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Grumpy Groucho&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2172-11-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;ShutterStock &lt;p&gt;Chronic negativity makes you angry, there’s no doubt about it. The reason this still makes it to our list, however, is because that anger coupled with the already present negativity does to you. In a recent study, it was proven that a simple five-minute outburst of anger can impair the immune system for more than six hours! Imagine having to live through episodes of this torture. To make matters worse, people with a short temper are also much more likely to suffer from poor circulation, heart attacks, and strokes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;No one is trustworthy for me!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2172-12-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;It isn’t bad enough that Debby feels inferior for no reason, but the blame games and angry episodes have also made her a loner. Studies show that people suffering from chronic negativity tend to be more introverted and bad at socializing for the mere reason that they don’t want to see people being their happy selves. This is known to cause dementia in even young people which later on snowballs down the slope to become cynicism. Not only does this instrumentally impact street smarts which we pick up on the way but also hampers our ability to trust anyone with more or less anything. Debby’s bottling up will inevitably lead to a burst one day and no, it’s never pretty. Cynicism leads to heart disease, which is already on the list of reasons which prove chronic negativity is a killer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Not afraid to catch these feels&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2172-13-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Chronic negativity, as we have established earlier on, harms you. But what if we told you it also harms those around you? Chronic negativity is a contagious state of mind which spreads not only fast but also is sure to make a mark on the victim, who may be in proximity only to comfort you. Human beings are empathetic creatures and we tend to mimic not only the facial expressions but also the tone and pitch of those around us. Being around Debby will certainly bring you down too, so make sure you proceed with caution, armed with loved ones to comfort her as much as possible!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A pessimist perfectionist?&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2172-14-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;ShutterStock &lt;p&gt;The fear of failure is often deemed one of the main features of the disease that is chronic negativity. Not only does the person feel very insecure and unsure of their decisions, they also tend to become failed perfectionists with the only thing holding them back is their own selves. Day in and day out, Debby reminds herself she is not good enough and never will be since nothing good is headed her way. The standards of satisfaction are set so incredibly and impractically high that they always seem out of reach. This, however, is never the case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Memories of days past&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2172-15-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Another unfortunate but common occurrence in the life of a person suffering from chronic negativity is being lost in negative thoughts about the past. They often say yesterday is history and tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift, which is why it’s called the present. To the latter bit, Debby is oblivious and turns towards it, a blind eye and deaf ear. You can either run from your mistakes or learn from them, but Debby is constantly living between the debate of a bad yesterday and a potentially bad tomorrow. This can lead to stress and severe lack of concentration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Happiness is never headed my way anyways&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2172-16-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock     &lt;p&gt;If you’re Debby, chances are you tend to be very naïve and jump to conclusions faster than anything else you. Negative assumptions play a big role in the daily life you live and you’re quick to give up on even things which could potentially turn your life around. The issue isn’t that you don’t want to be happy and be free like the birds in the sky. The only trouble is, you lack the attitude to break free of the shackles tying you down.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Chronic Negativity Is a Murderer!
