Since it is very personal in nature and requires one to be directly interacting with the public at large it is hard to assume any celebrities might be using it. However it may come as a shocker that several famous celebrities are using this app and in fact have even gone on few dates with the tinder suggestion. So it is not too far-fetched to hope that you might end up on a date with a celebrity of your dreams! It may be that you are swiping left and happen to come across a high profile celebrity on your phone screen. The mechanics of Tinder make endless possibilities ranging from casual hook ups to a long term relationship. This might attract the famous and the mighty to have a Tinder profile because after all they are also human like us and only looking for some good time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However it is not necessary that an individual you idolize and follow may come up to your pre-disposed notions about them. They might disappoint you in more ways than one and leave you shattered and their dream image suddenly turning into a horrifying reality you wished you knew about earlier. Following are some of the celebrities who are famous and hot but not all of them are dating material and it would be wise to swipe left on them!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Hillary Duff&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-487.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Via creativecommons &lt;p&gt;After her divorce from her famous affair with the hockey player Mike Comrie, Hillary announced openly about her using the Tinder app for dating purposes. She in fact made a music video about her using the Tinder app in her single called &lt;em&gt;Spark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;. The fact that she was actually trying to find someone through the app makes it a reality that we the common folks could have ended up with our dream celebrity for an actual evening out! The fact that Duff exhibited her using the Tinder app in her music video led to speculations that it is some form of a marketing gimmick and she might be getting some material for her song. But the truth of the matter is that the singer was only trying to exhibit the normal side of her and looking for an actual date like a normal person. However she did not fared too well as there was surprisingly no positive feedback on her profile and she later admitted in her interview to Cosmopolitan that “…I would not go with me on Tinder… “ . That sure is unfortunate since many people might have loved to go out with the attractive &lt;em&gt;Lizzie McGuire&lt;/em&gt; star.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Ronda Rousey&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-488.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Via creativecommons &lt;p&gt;It is true the former UFC champion and also making a star appearance in Hollywood blockbuster Fast and the Furious series, Ronda Rouse also used the Tinder app. She actually made her profile using a made up name of Brynn Campbell but of course in this day and age you can’t simply mix in with the crowd without getting recognized especially if you are a celebrity of Ronda’s caliber. She was soon identified as the famous MMA fighter. Ronda’s escapades on Tinder are somewhat nothing interesting to write about. She complained of her grueling workout and strict discipline which made her schedule very hectic to actually take time out and socially retreat with someone. Even if her schedule was a bit relaxed and she was available we would recommend to swipe left on her simply because she is scary. You do not want to go out on a date with a woman who calls out Floyd Mayweather as her idea of a casual exchange of fists. It is better not to mess with such a person and keep your distance because if you get in her wrong books you may recover in an intensive care of a hospital!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Lindsay Lohan&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-489.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Via creativecommons &lt;p&gt;Celebrities are known for their exclusivity and access to them is very limited but not in the case of Lindsay Lohan as her addiction with social media is well known. It would not come as a surprise that she may also have an account on tinder to connect with fans and maybe even an occasional date. However she never actually admitted to the fact that she has an account although she definitely had a profile under a different name. The incident which really let the cat out of the bag and validated her presence on tinder was Lindsay’s instagram post about her younger brother’s profile on tinder. She could not have come across another person’s profile without logging herself in first to use the app which proves she had a legitimate account. Anyways it would not do one too much of a good to date the actress because she has a reputation of discarding her potential dates in the most cold manner possible. We are not talking murder but do not expect any warmth or real connection because she is way out of everyone’s league!&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;5. Katy Perry&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-490.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Via creativecommons &lt;p&gt;It usually so happens that celebrities opt for such rapid fire dating service after they are through break up or divorce. Similarly Katy Perry after breaking up with John Mayer decided to explore her options using Tinder app. Upon giving interview to radio station Power 105.1, The Breakfast Club show Katy reportedly admitted to being single and deeply involved with tinder app. However it is very difficult nay impossible to come across her profile because tinder has rolled out a much more exclusive application for social elites. It is coined ‘Tinder select’ which has all the famous celebrities and famous people who one can join through exclusive invite only system. Hence if you are wondering why you never stumble across her profile maybe she is using the exclusive app and rightly so because unfortunately you did not make the cut to be rich or hot!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Britney Spears&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-491.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Via creativecommons &lt;p&gt;Well if the likes of Lindsay Lohan and Katy Perry made the list Miss Spear’s Tinder profile should not come as a surprise at all. The iconic superstar singer made an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and after revealing her break up with long term boyfriend David Lucado. Spears along with host Jimmy Fallon listed the pros and cons of dating her as a regular person. The speculations that she might have just made the account for the show and not really running it have been replaced with rumors of a slight possibility of actually using the app. Who knows she might surprise you on you tinder escapades because it is not the first time she would date some average joe. She has been in relationship with people far out of the celebrity circle and at much more normal level so it is a strong possibility to happen again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Leonardo Di Caprio&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-492.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Via creativecommons &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly Leonardo DiCaprio also has a profile on tinder. Not exactly in so many words but the founder of Tinder and CEO Sean Rad when asked about whether Leo is a legitimate user or not admitted it is quite a possibility. It could be taken as a definite yes because why not after all Leo can find some time on his hand especially after winning the much elusive Oscar in 2015. Who knows you may get to find out if you will get a swipe right or left from the superstar. Only way to find out is to upgrade your app to premium and camp at Los Angeles to find out if you really stand a chance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Ed Sheeran&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-494.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Via creativecommons &lt;p&gt;The English songwriter and singer was actually approached by Tinder to become their first verified celebrity user of the app but Sheeran turned down the offer. The star singer felt it was inappropriate to use his celebrity status in order to get dates through a social media platform. Even if someone is hoping to land a date with him you would better swipe left than to waste your time because he also cited his hectic schedule as one other reason he would not look forward to date anyone especially through this platform. Beats us why he is on the dating app in the first place if he is not ready to get down with someone and socialize.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Eric Stonestreet&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-496.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Via creativecommons     &lt;p&gt;The actor may play a gay part in the funny sitcom Modern Family but he is actually straight in real life. In fact he openly admitted to using the app solely for finding someone to hang out with. At &lt;em&gt;The Ellen DeGeneres &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Show &lt;/em&gt;he admitted to frequently go on dates using the Tinder platform to connect with new people. He was of the view that just because they are revered as celebrities do not take away their right to enjoy with everyday people. Although he did admit meeting new people makes him nervous because it is the face to face meeting in person unlike the app where you are behind the safety of screen.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"8 Smokin' Celebs That Secretly Use Tinder (and 7 We Would Swipe Left On)","description":"You might get lucky to land a date with a famous celeb but few of them are not for everyone to handle"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/8/641fbecd944e7fd1a6a6a5f05cbc1588_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/8/6978de58f44677ba008cebcd906941b8_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"8 Detective Riddles Only the Most Attentive 1% Can Solve"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/8/6043d22d1373b2ab2a257d192a9a3328_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Size 18 Pole Dancer Stuns the Audience and the Judges of the Talent Show With Her Lightness"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
