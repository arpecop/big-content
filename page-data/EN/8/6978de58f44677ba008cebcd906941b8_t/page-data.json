We often try to dodge any mental stimuli and hate anything that takes too much brainpower – be it math or a perplexing puzzle (try saying that ten times!). Worry not though, because we’ve got your back. We know it’s important to stimulate the mind and do some brain yoga. Here are some interesting riddles only the most attentive can solve – answers are at the end. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. The Blacksmith brothers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-433.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;One fine evening, Detective David is lounging around in his pajamas, swinging back in his favorite reclining chair and having some coffee. He also has his favorite music on but that’s suddenly interrupted by the loud crashing sound which comes from right behind him. David leaps out of the chair to find a brick has made its way through the closed window and notices the three notorious Blacksmith brothers James, Mark and Brad running away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;David changes clothes and is about to head out to investigate who threw the brick when a note slides through his front door saying ‘? Blacksmith. He broke your window’. David suddenly knows which one of the three did it. Do you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Hotel room&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-434.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;A woman is staying at a hotel room when suddenly someone knocks at the door. She answers and is surprised to open the door to see a stranger staring at her who bluntly says “Oh I’m sorry, I thought it was my room”. He then quickly turns away and heads for the elevators. The woman is quick to ring up security though and report him. Why do you think she did that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Poisoned iced-tea&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-435.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two girls were seated at a diner and both ordered iced-tea. One of them was extra thirsty and drank up very quickly while the other slowly sipped on her drink. The first one didn’t feel satiated so she ordered another drink and then another. A while later, the girl who drank slowly died after just one glass whereas the one who drank three was perfectly healthy. Why did the poison of three glasses kill but that of one didn’t?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Fly in the coffee&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-436.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;A man was seated at a Deli early morning and ordered a cup of coffee to enjoy alongside the morning news. He was disturbed abruptly though by finding a fly floating around in his coffee and he ordered the waiter to quickly replace his drink. The waiter took it away and brought back a seemingly new cup of coffee, but the man soon screamed “What is the service in this place? This is the same cup of coffee!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How did he know?&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;4. The murdered wife&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-437.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;A man was accused of killing his wife and was under trial at court. In his final statement, the man’s lawyer said “I am sure my client did not commit this murder. Bear with us for a moment and the allegedly murdered wife will come walking in through these doors!” The judge and jury were all surprised and fixed their gaze at the door but even after five minutes, no one came in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You see? You’re not sure she’s dead, which is why you all believed me and waited for her!” said the lawyer, but the judge and jury were quick to announce their verdict of guilty. How were they so sure the man had indeed killed his wife?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Sand smuggler?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-438.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;A man on a bicycle crosses into Mexico from America everyday wearing a shoulder bag. Customs officers know something is fishy and that he’s probably smuggling something. They check his bag often, but it always contains sand. They let him go. The man, however, is indeed smuggling something across the border daily. Do you know what it is?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Suicide or murder?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-439.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;h2&gt;1. The crime scene&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-440.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;A man murders stabs his wife in cold blood while on a drive and makes sure there are no witnesses. He then throws the blood stained knife into an abyss where no one can ever find it, and is sure to leave no fingerprints. He then disposes of her body and cleaning everything up, comes home. A few hours later, the police call him and tell him his wife has been murdered and that he needs to arrive at the crime scene.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On his arrival, he is immediately arrested for murdering her. How do they know it was him?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Answers:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;i. The Blacksmith brothers: The name of the brother is on the note! It says “? Blacksmith”, doesn’t it? Well, a ‘?’ is a question mark, so it says “Question Mark Blacksmith”. It was Mark!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ii. The woman is quick to notice the man is lying and that he wasn’t really lost because he knocked on the door! Who knocks on their own door? This is a popular trick used by thieves to make sure no one is inside before they move in to steal stuff!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;iii. This one was fairly simple – the poison wasn’t in the tea but in the ice! The lady who drank up quickly did so with little or no ice melting, but the one who drank slowly had her ice all melted into the drink,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;iv. How does the man know he hasn’t been served a new cup and it’s the same one minus the fly? Well, coffee is always served unsweetened! The man had already added sugar and after taking a sip was quick to realize it was the same!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;v. The learned judge and jury are correct in awarding the verdict since although they all did await the wife, the murdering husband did not look towards the doors. He knew he actually had killed her and there was no way she would come in through the doors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;vi. This riddle was the easiest of all! Bicycles! He smuggled bicycles!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;vi. We’ll forgive you if you got this one wrong because cassette players around anymore, but anyone who’s ever used one would know they have to be rewound in order to go back to the recording! Dead men tell no tales, and they surely don’t rewind cassettes! It was a murder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;vii. The Police only tell him of the murder and that he needs to arrive at the crime scene. They don’t tell him where exactly he has to come. The fact that he arrives at the exact place is a big hint that he killed her!&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;So, ladies and gentlemen, here were some riddles only the most attentive can solve. How many did you get right? Let us know!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"8 Detective Riddles Only the Most Attentive 1% Can Solve","description":"Do you think you’ve got what it takes to solve these mind-melting riddles?
