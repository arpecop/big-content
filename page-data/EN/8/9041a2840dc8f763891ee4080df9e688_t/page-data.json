There’s no pain in wrapping up the cold food in aluminum foil, but the problem comes in when you heat or cook food in it because you might be unconsciously poisoning yourself by doing so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the new study, published in 2012 by the &lt;em&gt;International Journal of Electrochemical Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, you may want to pause and think about wrapping your food in foil before cooking, because as per scientists some of the foil leaches into your food while cooking and this has a direct connection with various health issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You are about to convinced, as you’ll get to know the reasons for not using aluminum foil in cooking based on some very intriguing facts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Aluminum and Health Effects&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1399.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Scientists are continuously exploring the health effects caused by high-level of aluminum intake in our daily lives. Just as smoking can damage our lungs and overexposure to UV rays can damage our skin, similarly, the overexposure of aluminum in our body can result in some serious health risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several studies have suggested that high level of aluminum intake can cause significant damage to the human bodies such as with renal impairment, reproduction issues and certain bone diseases. This happens when the amount exceeds than the capacity of the human body to excrete. If not excreted properly, the aluminum is deposited in our bodies and gives rise to various health problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The damage caused by the intake of aluminum depends upon, how much our body can handle its accumulation in correlation with the permissible shots allowed by World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. World Health Organization (WHO) Standards&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1400.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;The fact is, 7 to 8 percent of the earth’s crust comprises of aluminum and thus life on earth has evolved in the aluminum-rich environment. And due to this reason, humans have been adapted to aluminum exposure over a long period of time. Every human body is suited for perfectly releasing a small amount of aluminum perfectly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apart from some food items, the aluminum sulphate is also used in the process of purifying water. That means, we do ingest aluminum some way or the other. However, the permissible amount of Aluminum for a human body, as per World Health Organization (WHO), is 40 milligrams per kilograms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That means a person weighing 60 kilograms can have 2,400 milligrams of Aluminum in his/her body without bothering about it. But unfortunately today, the amount of aluminum getting into our bodies, by cooking food with aluminum foil, is far more than this permissible amount.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. A leading cause of Alzheimer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1401.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer has direct connections with exceeding intake of aluminum, as many of the formal inquiries into aluminum toxicity are especially concerned with its association with Alzheimer as per studies. According to researchers, excessive aluminum intake can lead to degenerative symptoms including Alzheimer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aluminum is also considered as one of the most influential neurotoxins associated with Alzheimer. Apart from that, water with high aluminum and low fluoride concentration are associated with Alzheimer for sure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the altered living conditions with modern industrialization and other ultra-modern living conditions, the ratio of aluminum pollution have increased manifold and as a result, Alzheimer has said to be one the most prevalent diseases of modern times.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;4. It’s bad for your brain&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1402.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Aluminum is said to produce toxic and oxidative stress in the brain. It is a potential risk factor in cognitive impairment in old age group people as it has been proven by a study which showed that elders having cognitive impairment had aluminum levels 20 times more than a middle-aged group. Aluminum is recognized as one of the several metals known to affect the humans’ neurological system. And as discussed above, the supreme brain health concern is the Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is also observed that the excessive intake can also result in reducing the growth rate of brain cells in human body. Some studies have also indicated that people who suffer from Alzheimer also have abnormal volumes of aluminum in their brain tissues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Aluminum leaches while cooking&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1403.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The researchers clearly state that there is a certain amount of aluminum that leaches when the food is cooked with aluminum foil. However, the amount of aluminum leach depends upon the type of food and temperature at which it is being cooked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aluminum is more likely to leach into foods that are spicy, acidic and liquid food solutions like lemon and tomato juice. The acidic food sparks an aggressive process that dissolves thin layers of aluminum into food. Leaching level climbs up even more when the temperature is raised and spices are added to food.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers say that an easy channel for the metal to enter human body is provided when the food is cooked in aluminum foil. Apart from add-on spices and high temperature, the pH value of the food solution also determines the quantity of aluminum leaching.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Foods and Utensils&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1404.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Aluminum is one of the most widely distributed metals on earth and is used in the making of many everyday products. Aluminum is present in corn, yellow cheese, salt, herbs, spices, and tea. Even the flour and some vegetables that we use have aluminum in it. This shows that our bodies are prone to a decent amount of aluminum naturally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apart from food, a large amount of cookware, placed in our kitchens, is made up of aluminum. But these pots and pans are less problematic than the aluminum foil itself. The aluminum pots and pans and other cooking utensils are oxidized giving them a coated layer which prevents leaching to a huge extent. This layer can easily be worn out by scrubbing these pots after use. But, boiling water several times in pots again creates a matte layer that prevents leaching too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. No Protection!!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1405.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com     &lt;p&gt;As discussed above, the pots have a coated layer that prevents leaching. But cooking food with foil paper is a completely different story. Like how we can make an inner layer in pots by boiling water several times, this layer cannot be created with the foil as it is disposable and cannot be used repeatedly other times. The foil itself is not oxidized and there’s no way of creating a protection layer prior cooking, because of which the scientists are advising against it. Reactions caused by the direct interaction of aluminum’s volatile nature with heat contribute to increasing leaching during the cooking process due to high pH level, particularly with spicy foods and foods that are highly acidic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Scientists: Why You Should Never Ever Cook with Aluminum Foil!","description":"Still cooking food in aluminum foil?
