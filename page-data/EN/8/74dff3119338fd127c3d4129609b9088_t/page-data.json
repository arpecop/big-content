When said anonymously, guys are really frank about their confessions. Below are 15 confessions that go deeper than just physical attributes about what guys find unattractive on women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. Attention Seekers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-599.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Even us girls don’t like to see someone who is very obviously asking for attention, and guys are no different. It’s important to be confident, but being over confident can rub a guy the wrong way when it comes to girls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. That’s Nasty!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-600.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Guys are very turned off by women who have poor hygiene. They don’t expect us to get full on spa treatments daily, just the basics such as showering and brushing your teeth is enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Claw Hands&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-601.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Guys aren’t really fans of intricate nail art on women. Long nails can sometimes show that a girl is more high maintenance, and that is one reason why guys prefer shorter, more natural looking nails.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Primo Pouts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-602.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Men don’t find overly plump lips attractive. They like naturally full lips that don’t make it look like a girl is in pain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Puff Puff&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-603.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Smoking is not only a trait that is unattractive on men, but also on women. The health issues that come from smoking are what really makes it unattractive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Cake Face&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-604.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Less is more when it comes to make-up and there are ways to still use a lot of make-up but make it look really natural. Men don’t really know the difference from the natural look to a full face but that doesn’t mean go overboard with applying make-up.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;h2&gt;9. Communicate, People!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-605.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Social media and dating apps makes face to face communication a hard thing to do for some people. Not being able to hold a conversation with someone is a huge turn off.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;8. Control the Volume&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-606.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Guys don’t like it when a girl is constantly yelling and loud. It can be found annoying and as if a girl doesn’t know how to read a situation appropriately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Get a Life!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-607.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Making your life all about your significant other is not a good idea. It is good for a person to have their own “thing” separate from your partner. It makes a person more interesting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Misery Does Not Love Company&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-608.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Having a bad attitude is something that will end the romance or spark in a relationship. Being around constant negativity is exhausting and that’s something that is a turn off to men.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Girl Power&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-609.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;As a woman, picking on and bringing down another woman is something that makes you look like a very rude person. Guys pick up on this and are not very fond of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Honesty is the Best Policy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-610.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Trying to make a guy guess why you’re upset isn’t effective for you or him. This habit can make a guy turned off to a girl because they won’t catch on to your subtle hints and that will make you mad which will in turn make him upset.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;h2&gt;3. B***h, Please!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-611.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Cockiness and immaturity is a big turn off for guys. They don’t like a girl who expects everything to go their way and who thinks that they’re better than everyone else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. The Bearded Lady&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-612.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;It is hard to find a guy who thinks a mustache on a lady is a good thing because of how society looks at facial hair. It’s natural for women to have facial hair, but try telling a guy that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Insecurity&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-613.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock     &lt;p&gt;Confidence in a woman is attractive to men. It’s important for women to forget their insecurities and just feel comfortable in their own skin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"15 Honest Whisper Confessions from What Men Find Unattractive in Women","description":"Girls find themselves wondering at times what guys think are unattractive about us.
