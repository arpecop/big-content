Even the dreary and boring hospitals are trying to incorporate the happiness and feel good factor of this occasion. It is always heartwarming to see the hospital staff get busy with decorating the halls and passageways of otherwise boring white walls. Hospital of all the places needs such overhauls to give the patients those essential pick me ups and a reason to smile and celebrate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have compiled the following pictures which are excellent ideas for decorating the hospitals and give it that Christmas face lift.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; #nurseswag #hospitalchristmasdecorations&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  Crystal Traywick (@crystalatraywick) on Nov 29, 2015 at 9:57am PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This snow covered Christmas tree look is easy to execute since it just requires a few inflated gloves to give it that look and some decoration to complete the look. If anyone is missing a glove from nursing staff this will most probably be the reason. Anyways it looks cute and really creative improvisation to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Brilliant hospital Christmas decorations. pic.twitter.com/oZVPigP4Z5&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;‚Äî You Had One Job (@_youhadonejob1) November 22, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is another creative take on Christmas decoration while keeping it relevant to the hospital at the same time. This brilliant idea simply makes use of a tinsel garland attached to the wall in the shape of a heart beat monitor display. Again it is very simple and does not make use of a lot of different items to decorate. At the same time it makes the lifeless interiors of hospitals look festive effortlessly. Just make sure the tinsel don‚Äôt flatline!&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; See what the recycled vial caps can do.. üëçüòÄ #creative #dyi #recycledvialcaps #vialcaps #caps #recycle #hospitalchristmasdecorations #christmasideas #medicalchristmasidea #christmasdecors #hospital #wardstation #hospitalward #candycanelane #nursingisanart #okdi #okaydiay #iloveokdi #onlyinokdi #paskongokdi #christmas2014&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  Mitch Pins (@praying.narsmitch) on Dec 21, 2014 at 10:58am PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This hospital staff was really efficient at recycling stuff instead of just plain discarding it. These used vial caps came in handy to make the passageways look brilliantly lit and kudos to whoever pictured their usage in this manner. Not bad at giving these otherwise festive d√©cor a twist of hospital by incorporating such items.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Frosty, the continence pad snowman! #HospitalChristmasDecorations #nursing #thisnursinglife&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  John Townsend (@jtwnz) on Dec 16, 2014 at 12:38pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Utilizing the absorbent pads like this shown above to make a snowman is brilliant. It just makes use of a pad with a little decoration on the neck and nose for a needless syringe which screams of brilliant improvisation. The tree silhouette made with used cardboard boxes in the background perfectly completes the look for the festive occasion.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; It&#39;s beginning to look a lot like Christmas üéÑ#RNlife #HospitalChristmas&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by @ trishcadilli on Nov 30, 2015 at 6:52pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Making a wreath out of empty plastic bottles in this manner might look weird to some but it is absolutely creative for a festive hospital Christmas decoration. The syringe to tie the knot of the bow in the middle perfectly complements the look.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; ChristLMAs Tree.
