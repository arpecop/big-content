The staff at the hospital were taken aback by her behavior and managed to come up with a mattress for the princess so she could lay by her child comfortably.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1246.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;The mother two and the wife of the heir to the throne, the Prince of Wales, Diana was only twenty at the time. Princess Diana was married to Prince Charles in 1981 in what was described by many as a fairy tale wedding. However it was not a happy marriage and the couple divorced in 1996, in a divorce that shook the monarchy and defied royal tradition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1247.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikimedia &lt;p&gt;Prince Charles eventually ended up marrying his long time paramour Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The late Princess Diana was a very well-known humanitarian and her efforts to try to improve the lives o others are widely known and well documented. Be it de stigmatizing AIDS patients or some other humanitarian cause, the late Princess Diana was always at the helm to try to chance the World and to try to make it a better place for all of us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She was also a staunch campaigner against the use of landmines, which indiscriminately kill and injure combatants and non-combatants alike for a long time after hostilities have ended and lead to needless suffering long after active hostilities have come to an end.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1248.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;In another break from royal tradition the princess was also known to visit the homeless. This was a break from the past and such visits by royals had been virtually unknown before her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This incident was not isolated in any way. However, it just adds to the legacy of the people’s princess who had always been known for being far less stiff upper lipped than is custom among the British Royal family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“My mother introduced that sort of area to me a long time ago. It was a real eye-opener and I am very glad she did. It has been something I have held close to me for a long time.” Her son the second in line to the throne Prince William, stated when he became the patron of one of his mother’s charities. She introduced the royal family to the idea of charities and her sons have followed in her foot steps and are not like the royals of the old days who were privately educated and whose exposure to the public was limited.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1249.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Princess Diana can also be considered the Paparazzi Princess and her untimely death was caused in part by the Paparazzi who incessantly followed her around and on the fateful evening of her death the Dodi and Diana had been trying get away from the press and enjoy some quality private time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her tragic death in a car crash with her then boyfriend and lover Egyptian businessman and playboy Dodi El Fayed who also died in the crash.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;The death of Princess Diana marked a low point for the popularity of the Royal family with many conspiracy theories surrounding her death on that fateful August night in 1997. The public felt the pain and suffering of her two young sons Prince William who only 15 at the time and Prince Harry who at the time was thirteen years old and was particularly badly affected by the sudden and tragic death of his mother. This year marks the 20th anniversary of her passing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Prince Harry Was Seriously Ill When He Was 3 – Then Diana Did Something That Makes Me Cry","description":"Prince Harry fell ill at the tender age of three years, his mother the late Princess Diana slept on the hospital floor in order to be as near as possible to her baby boy."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/5/0a0557bd0d821ffa79b75db0adf80215_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/5/0fc142921d7bcc8ab3297587210a0e85_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"14 Secrets Movie Theaters Are Hiding From You"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/5/02ab45d56a01516b0168a78616a11c45_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Top 12 Ghost Sightings That NEED Explaining"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
