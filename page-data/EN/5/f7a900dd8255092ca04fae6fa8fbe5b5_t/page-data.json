For some, it represents harsh trauma witnessed at some point in their lives, and for others (like those Mountain Dew adrenaline junkies!) it can mean life manifest into one emotion. But regardless of how other people might perceive it, one fact remains; fear is perhaps the most volatile feeling a human undergoes in a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why fear happens&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2191-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;In biological connotations, fear happens to be a trigger human faces in the face of imminent danger and threats. Like a feeling that has evolved through generations and thousands of years of evolutionary traits, fear is a response that makes the body’s use of deduction and reasoning to resonate if a situation warrants avoiding or running away, which makes it a natural way of our mind asking us to avoid things. The pansy version of Spidey senses, except they’re usually right when they ask you to avoid licking a rattlesnakes head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The gravest fears&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2191-2-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;And yet, one uncovered and not an expansively researched topic is that of the fear of the unknown. If our brain encounters strange or unforeseen symbols, it immediately reverts to its fallback emotion of fear which dictates us to avoid the unknown because they are unresolved (and potential) dangers in our consciousness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Image tests&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2191-3-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;This concept of fear and the intoxicating mixture of it with the unknown means psychoanalysts can blend the two into a meaningful cocktail that can deduce the state of someone’s mind. Through the act of steering a person into the unknown, one can find out much about them, not only through there coping mechanisms, but through their conscious decisions as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;And how your brain reacts to them&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2191-4-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The following picture uses exactly those tools to adjudge your character and deepest fears because it triggers the part of your brain that births associative fears unconsciously. Because the underlying theme of the picture is an implicit skull, the feeling of danger or fear is outright evident in mind, and thus the brain directly goes into a state of adrenaline where it makes sub-conscious decisions reflecting the actual inner state of a person, their personality, and their minds. This leads to the fact that the first thing you register in the picture gives a ballpark estimation to the unconscious trigger in your brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Test effects&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; skull illusion painting 02 – &amp;quot;ichigo&amp;quot; 2014 – #skullillusion&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by trevor brown (@babyart) on Feb 26, 2017 at 11:40pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This psycho-analytical test is rapid as well as comfortable and efficient in determining your personality to an astonishing accuracy. Simply take a look at the picture, lock on the first thing you register and focus on in it and read about it to see where you stand in your personality and fears. Take a look at the other things and their interpretations too to know where else people can stand and have fun with this complex mental simulation. Read on to find out the six flabbergasting things in the picture that can deduce all about your personality!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The girl&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; skull illusion painting 02 – &amp;quot;ichigo&amp;quot; 2014 – #skullillusion&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by trevor brown (@babyart) on Feb 26, 2017 at 11:40pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those who saw the young lady sitting first, your personality type is based on the youthfulness of fears and how they are sourced to the earlier stages of life when the basis of character is laid down. Thus the concerns that are birthed are sourced from childhood traumas and dilemma and can be contributed to in generous quantities through the repression of these emotions built up in your childhood. The types and qualities these events need to have to make that significant impact on a child’s life are reasonably debatable; however, their need to be settled is immense owing to the amplified weight they gain in later years. With a chance of resurfacing as fears, cognitive disturbances, and addictions and other socially unacceptable desires which leads to social exclusion in the long run.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;And how the judgment stands&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2191-7-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is that the basis of all human personality starts with one’s mother who is pivotal to childhood emotional development that lays the base of the relational construct. Such is the importance and magnitude of maternal conduct that the most prevalent of human trauma and fears are projected into emotions as a result of prolonged maternal figure deprivations which lead to a lack of comfort emotionally and thus resultant frailty to deal with situations. This can also be brought about by little or no motherly affection at all which leads to a projection of subconscious fears.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consequentially, the child is unable to effectively adapt responsibility and have an innate fear of spearheading decisions. The trauma may not even appear as late as childhood and can show up in the prenatal phases as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The butterfly&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; skull illusion painting 02 – &amp;quot;ichigo&amp;quot; 2014 – #skullillusion&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by trevor brown (@babyart) on Feb 26, 2017 at 11:40pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Globally associated to have positive connotations, the butterfly is held in high regard as a symbol of beauty and rejuvenation. However, focusing on occult interpretations, the butterfly; due to its formation process also signifies beginnings and new chances in some darker contexts. This analysis is based on dreams, and thus the bright and colorful butterfly is linked as a sign of happiness, good luck and new beginnings in one’s life, whereas quite contrastingly colorless butterflies are shown to mean regret, unrealized changes in life and their perspective but unhappening benefits on us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Darker fear connotation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2191-9-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;In the limelight, the spiritual connotation of the butterfly symbol is the conveyor of dead souls in the afterlife; linking it to the world of the dead which is usually enough to send shivers down your spine. To interpret simply, registering the butterfly as the first thing seen on the picture often symbolizes a subconscious fear that associates itself to the prospect of death and can also be taken to mean like the fear of lost chances on life or not living it to the fullest. These people have an intense repression of emotions to grieve over closed one who has departed to the afterlife.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;Strawberry choosing&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; skull illusion painting 02 – &amp;quot;ichigo&amp;quot; 2014 – #skullillusion&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by trevor brown (@babyart) on Feb 26, 2017 at 11:40pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With a location that is the prime center of the picture and a size that dwarfs the original fruit in comparison, the strawberry is an accurate representation of the heart in its entire entirety. Sharing more than just the iconic color, strawberries have been a symbol of love since ancient times and is the context of deeper, and darker meanings can mean the resultant pain that comes out of a lover’s qualm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the roots lie in how there is a legend based on the theory. After Adonis’ demise, the Goddess Venus cried continuously and every tear of her that fell, turned into strawberries on the ground.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So if the first object you saw was the strawberry, you seek something that lies within your heart and thus your greatest fears and desires also arise from the subconscious resistance you keep engaging against love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;And its origins&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2191-11-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Fear out of love holds roots in our youth and the love encountered amongst parents during parenting is primal in our decryption of it. Watching our parents interact and express love to each other was how we came to interpret attraction and intimacy. However, this is only one of the sources, and even our first relationship heartbreak can signify a heartbreak which becomes the primary influencer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The elephantine size of the strawberry only shows how much love you are willing to give to people and that where there is a shortcoming in this giving; it exists only because you are afraid of the fallout repercussions of living too much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The spider&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; skull illusion painting 02 – &amp;quot;ichigo&amp;quot; 2014 – #skullillusion&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by trevor brown (@babyart) on Feb 26, 2017 at 11:40pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The spider comes as no surprise on a list about fears as it tops the list of most phobias in the form of arachnophobia. It is an evolutionary trait that prepared us to avoid poisonous critters, and thus some people can register the spider first straight away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a symbol, the spider is a subconscious alarm to us to signify that out surrounding are unsafe or give off insecurity vibes. Spotting the spider first simply means that your innate fears take root from your inability to feel secure in an environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Insecurity interpretation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2191-13-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;There is a severe inborn distrust in how places look safe, and thus you push yourself to perceive danger even in areas that are completely harmless. An edgy way to live, this lifestyle always pushes you towards the edge and prevents you from being content, happy person. This causes over thinking necessary plans and being in a constant state of anxiety, panic attacks, and insomnia to struggle with the unease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This fear of being unsafe is deeply rooted in worried people who with their hyperactive tendencies combine traits of worry in their brains and stem to that limiting mindset.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The tree&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; skull illusion painting 02 – &amp;quot;ichigo&amp;quot; 2014 – #skullillusion&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by trevor brown (@babyart) on Feb 26, 2017 at 11:40pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Holding significant psychological importance, the tree reveals a lot about a person’s psyche by being drawn by them. How they draw a tree is how they feel within. A person mind can never be decoded without assessing their roots, and that is where trees hold mounting significance. And yet the connotation runs much deeper. When two trees form an overhead bridge, the mystical symbolism is that of a geared internal conflict that goes unresolved by us. This emotional split hangs on the risk of consuming us if we cannot merge it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Interpretations&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2191-15-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;When the two trees stand out as the first things you registered on the picture, it seems that the source of your deepest emotional fears is compounded from being accepting of this subconscious split in our emotional capacity. While you are taking people into your inner circle of trust, and this fear keeps you grounded enough to be next to the shadows and yet not merge with it, quite rebelliously. Our doubts and uncertainties are something most of us are quite well acquainted with, and yet it seems like a whole new perspective when told by someone else. It is because of this precise reason that finding someone with that wholesome attitude is so important because any predetermined opinion or perspective bias can ruin the situational interpretation for us and that is amplified here considering we face our shadow self.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The teddy bears&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; skull illusion painting 02 – &amp;quot;ichigo&amp;quot; 2014 – #skullillusion&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by trevor brown (@babyart) on Feb 26, 2017 at 11:40pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Growing up, we all have had a favorite doll or stuffed animal that has signified itself to be great distress and tension reliever, and thus we can always find comfort associated to that teddy bear. Hugging it was a calming effect and took us to our happy place whether we were awake or asleep. The hug took us to a getaway, where we could be understood, necessary, safe and warm without limit. And these lines are still what teddy bears hold in the symbolical world, a friend who knows unconditionally and represents and an emotional haven for you that gives love. The natural response of children to avoid fear was to hug their teddy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Symbolism&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2191-17-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The connotation of teddy bears in the context is a bit dark and twisted because they are comforters and if you registered them first you are afraid of being afraid. While this fear is innate, it sources from mental trauma which holds childhood roots and represents a time when you had feared and no way to escape it or comfort yourself. It has dark symbolism indeed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-26-9-2191-18-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com     &lt;p&gt;So you checked out your personality type and it more probably than not left you shook and for a good reason as well. Feel dazed from all the decoding? Well that’s the body’s reaction on absorbing realities, and it’s always harder to believe when someone else tells it, but c’est la vie!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"The First Thing You See on This Picture Can Reveal Your Personality's Deepest Darkest Fears","description":"Be prepared to be surprised"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/5/f7a900dd8255092ca04fae6fa8fbe5b5_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/5/fb033e162d3e46de12e852d49716ace5_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"17 Signs That Will Help You Spot a Person Who Is Secretly Jealous of You"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/5/ee2e831bbf9eb5920f40b453d46fd8c5_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"What Is Love and What Is Not"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
