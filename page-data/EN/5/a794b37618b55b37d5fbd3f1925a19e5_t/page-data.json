Especially in the hot summer days, sunscreen is a must in order to avoid skin damage from the sunâ€™s UV rays. With extended exposure to such rays, one can develop skin cancer, sunburn, and several more horrible conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All this advice may still not manage to convince you about wearing sunscreen every time you go out. However, maybe a real-life story would do the trick. Below is a discussion about the experiences of a Texan fellow who neglected this very important precaution. Maybe his predilection would help us to finally take the necessary are of our skin:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Winter Sun&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If one has been brought up in areas which are notoriously cold, the problem of avoiding the sun amplifies. Whenever there is enough daylight to be comfortable, there is usually a mad rush to get in all the sun one can. As a result, sunbathing and beach visits become a must.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Summer is hence a time to celebrate as much as possible, along with staying outdoors. While this is a commendable activity, it is only recommended that one takes the necessary precautions at all times. It could be tempting to just go out into bright sunlight, even if it is not hot outside. Leaving the sunscreen behind could make us regret this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Vanity of Huckabay&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1598.jpeg&quot;/&gt;twitter/CadeHuckabay &lt;p&gt;The story of a Texan man named Cade Huckabay may make many people pause and think. This individual experienced a sunny day where he lived and made just one unwise decision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This decision was a risky one in many ways. Basically, Huckabay shaved his head before going out. In this way, he got in some good exercise and sun that should have kept him healthy. He even got some chores in like mowing the lawn. However, he paid the price for not wearing sunscreen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Social Media Update&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1599.jpeg&quot;/&gt;reddit &lt;p&gt;When he got back home, Huckabay tweeted about what had happened to his unprotected head as a result of his actions. Basically, his head got extremely sunburnt, to the extent that it swelled up quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In his social media update, Huckabay revealed just how swollen his head was. He posted pictures of how he could actually make a dent in his head. He did this by putting a finger into the swollen part of his head. The dent was quite noticeable and worthy of being documented for education purposes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Going Viral&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One time I shaved my head, got severely sunburned, &amp;amp; swelled up just a little bit ðŸ™‚ pic.twitter.com/9FWw3jcdYf&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;â€” Cade Huckabay (@CadeHuckabay) December 5, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Huckabayâ€™s tweet soon became extremely popular, even viral. The original tweet gathered more than 300k likes. More and more people began talking about this incident and engaging with this tweet. His story was retweeted by his fans more than a hundred thousand times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, simply going viral is not enough. One should be responsible and mature enough to handle the criticisms as well as the praise. Luckily, Huckabay is both these things and more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Laughing Through the Pain&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One time I shaved my head, got severely sunburned, &amp;amp; swelled up just a little bit ðŸ™‚ pic.twitter.com/9FWw3jcdYf&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;â€” Cade Huckabay (@CadeHuckabay) December 5, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Huckabay was nothing if not a good sport. His main takeaway from this whole incident was one of fun and laughter. This is quite a valuable and sought-after commodity in this day and age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically, Huckabay finds a lot of comfort in the fact that other people can see the humorous side of things. Sure, he himself was in quite a bit of pain, but thereâ€™s nothing like laughter to alleviate this. He even described the whole outcome as something â€˜hilariousâ€™.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A Humorous Circle&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/d-copyediting-22-12-3532-03-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;twitter/CadeHuckabay &lt;p&gt;Several times, Huckabay has appreciated how closely-knit an Internet audience could be. He is fascinated and attracted by the concept of laughing at his situation with his followers.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;He also appreciates the originality and humor of the jokes people have about is head. He says he is laughing all the more at the comparisons made by such people. These could range from being compared to a donut to having a little coin purse in his head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, this does not mean that he isnâ€™t taking his work very, very seriously. In fact, his main goal in making his story public was to provide public service messages about the dangers of sunburn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Reiterating the Dangers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Huckabay proceeded to fulfill his goal by tweeting about how much pain he was in. the first day of the sunburn, he asserts, his scalp was not fit to be touched. He only found out about the dent after that eventful first day. The swelling itself did not require any strong medication, but did go down after a few days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Huckabay also emphasizes how lucky he was. He didnâ€™t need much treatment or have any lasting repercussions. At the same time, he is a reminder of just how dangerous a game one is playing when they forget sunscreen. His shaved head further provided complete access to a very sensitive area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Treatment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Huckabay claimed that the swelling went away with regular use of painkillers and ice. The painkillers he used were Advil, and we believe he iced the swollen part of his head until it went down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Huckabay was very lucky this time, it may not happen like this for everyone. He insists that his followers take special heed in applying sunscreen unlike himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Burning Stats&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a lot of statistical data on sunburns and skin diseases caused by overexposure to the sun. The United Statesâ€™ CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) reports that fifty percent of American adults have experienced sunburn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This data shows that Huckabay had a lot of people suffering right along with him. This just goes to show just how many adults are not taking the proper precautions. It is his time they did so in order to provide an example for the younger generations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Fellow Sufferers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Speaking of fellow sufferers, there were quite a lot of Twitter users who could empathize with Huckabay. One woman shared a picture of how she could only use one eye after four days of sunburn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Others have also chimed in, posting pictures and stories of similar experiences. This may be an unexpected way to bring people together, but worth it if people become more responsible as a result.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Call to Action&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One time I shaved my head, got severely sunburned, &amp;amp; swelled up just a little bit ðŸ™‚ pic.twitter.com/9FWw3jcdYf&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;â€” Cade Huckabay (@CadeHuckabay) December 5, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result of this trend, several facts have come to light. One, of course, is the need to apply sunscreen even when wandering out into the winter sun. Itâ€™s not just the summer sunlight when things can go awry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Secondly, Huckabayâ€™s case has taught many the importance of spreading this public service message as far and wide as possible. This would include retweets, live videos, pictures, stories, and whatever it takes to get the message across. Prevention is infinitely better than cure. Hence, one may hope that sunburn becomes less of a common thing and more of an exception.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Update on Cade&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One time I shaved my head, got severely sunburned, &amp;amp; swelled up just a little bit ðŸ™‚ pic.twitter.com/9FWw3jcdYf&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;â€” Cade Huckabay (@CadeHuckabay) December 5, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cade Huckabayâ€™s head has fortunately gone back to its former size. While it is no longer so much fun, it is normal. Thatâ€™s usually all we require of our bodies on any given day. He posted this update on social media in order to reassure those who were worried about him. Of course, his sense of humor would not let him rest without mock-lamenting the loss of his denty head version.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lessons Learnt&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The way Huckabay dealt with this problem has made us learn several lessons on how to deal with certain issues. His problem was relatively minor, yet many have made a serious issue out of lesser complaints.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Huckabayâ€™s method of laughing even when in discomfort or pain is a heartening one for all of us. He was undergoing treatment for his condition, but did not pass up a chance to laugh at himself. He further appreciated just how original people could be when they came up with more jokes and comparisons about his head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They say that laughter is the best medicine. This is probably true, and it is this upbeat attitude which may have led to his speedy recovery. Otherwise, such a situation could have one panicking and moaning in next to no time. Some people may even have been too embarrassed to post their sunburnt pictures online. By being brave enough to take this step; Huckabay got a good time out of his sunburn. Not only this, but he also managed to spread an important message while enjoying himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Not Looking for Sympathy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, there are always naysayer and critics whenever something goes viral online. Huckabay was accused of seeking attention and sympathy as well as being careless with himself. However, it is clear that he didnâ€™t want anyoneâ€™s pity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After his original post, Huckabay tweeted about how he didnâ€™t want anyone to feel unduly sorry for him. He asserted that he alone was responsible for what had befallen him. As a result, he was quite prepared to face the consequences of his negligence.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s a lot of fun playing on the beach and enjoying the hot sun outside. However, we simply cannot afford to leave out the protection that keeps us safe from dangerous rays. If we still donâ€™t understand this, we just may end up like this man.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Texan man's plight is a warning to all to ALWAYS wear sunscreen","description":"Applying sunscreen could be a pain, but it is a necessary habit."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/5/a794b37618b55b37d5fbd3f1925a19e5_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/5/a981190f8b8fb50bf5a0f0abd8656455_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"14 Actors Who Refuse to Work Together"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/5/a1576ec7bd37e3c0725709f52a4ddff5_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"If You See a Child Sitting in This Position, Stop Him Before It's Too Late!"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
