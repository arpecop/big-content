He belongs to Azerbaijan and has carried out a lot of protests against the injustice of his country. The artist had to end up leaving the country in the year 2014 due to political pressures. However, that did not stop him from doing his work, which is exposing the truth in the eyes of the common man.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His following creations relate to the modern world and are described in detail below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;17. Modern human&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-721.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© Gunduz Aghayev  &lt;p&gt;This is the story of the common man who is tied up in the emotional and physical battles of today. Also this is making us quite unhealthy tied in chains of the diseases which are taking us by storm. We are looking for supports to help us in life instead of trying to be able to walk on our own. Our dependency on the electronics, which is our source of entertainment as well is becoming too much. Thus making us immobile and couch potatoes, as there is no physical activity involved in our lives now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;16. The last oasis&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-722.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© Gunduz Aghayev  &lt;p&gt;This one shows that the due to pollution and global warming in our environment mankind is slowly extinguishing and the greenery is becoming non-existent. The factories smoke which can be seen in the picture is killing the humans and traffic problems as well are making it worst for humans to survive. The animals are scared of this situation and are clinging to each other for help. Also the humans are now trying to clear the last green patch on which the animals are surviving so they are afraid of dying. High-rise buildings are showing the way that instead of tall trees we are now having buildings all around us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. Miracle Travel&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-723.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© Gunduz Aghayev  &lt;p&gt;The use of technology these days has made us so mesmerized that we fail to enjoy life. WE are so engrossed in using this technology that we do not care about what is happening around us at times we do not even listen to what the other person is saying. The person who is blowing the trumpet seems like a pied piper which is “smartphones” in this case and this is the reason of downfall of the mankind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. Political prisons&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-724.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© Gunduz Aghayev  &lt;p&gt;Politics these days is the worst profession to join these days. It has lost all its respect and is now a profession where everyone is just trying to be ahead of the other person. But what these politicians do not know that grafting is leading them towards their own graves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. He lost his head&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-725.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© Gunduz Aghayev  &lt;p&gt;In order to move towards advancement, the humans of modern times are not realizing that Earth is getting very ignored and had literally been trampled by us. The fact that the person in the picture has lost his head means that the thinking abilities of the people has gone wasted and we are now just functioning without it, thus not knowing what to do with our planet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Virtual patriotism&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-726.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© Gunduz Aghayev  &lt;p&gt;In this picture the artist is trying to convey a lot of sad realities of our lives. He is saying that while the soldier is dying we are all busy updating statuses on social media not knowing that our actions are actually pushing him towards death. The feet which is pushing the humans is showing that we are being controlled by the officials of the government who are fooling us. Instead of trying to find amicable solutions they are propagating and trying to start a war. The common man is just unaware of all these facts and the poor soldier has to give up his life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Migration&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-727.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© Gunduz Aghayev  &lt;p&gt;Due to constant wars and terrorism spreading like wild fire all around the world humans have to continue to move and taking heavy burdens while camouflaging themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Freedom of speech&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-728.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© Gunduz Aghayev  &lt;p&gt;Although there is freedom of speech in the modern world but those in charge of the content and higher authorities of this world are not letting the truth come out. The jailed camera is trying to show that the truth is being forged when it comes towards us and we are unaware of the proper facts. This artistic image is also trying to tell us that we believe in what we see but that is not the reality.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;9. Theory of evolution&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-729.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© Gunduz Aghayev  &lt;p&gt;In this picture the artist is trying to portray the human evolution which started by the time of being Homo sapiens. Although mankind has evolved but it is still going back to the previous times due in increase in war, bombing, terrorism and natural calamities. Due to the use of heavy arms and ammunition the mankind is also facing deformities. The pointy eared human with a rock shows that the humans are going back to the primitive methods of survival.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Made in China&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-730.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© Gunduz Aghayev  &lt;p&gt;In this particular picture Gunduz Agayev is trying to depict the condition in China. The freedom of speech is blocked, which is evident through the cloth on the mouth of the lady and things are being produced in huge amounts without considering the quality. The force is being used to make the laborers work and they have to continue working without having a say in any of the matters. The stamp of made in China is everywhere in the world and the things produced are lacks good quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Bait&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-731.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© Gunduz Aghayev  &lt;p&gt;This is a true depiction of terrorism and how the terrorists are using signs. They are using tools to fool the human and once they are able to fool the terrorists end up killing them through suicide bombing. For terrorists it does not matter whether they are killing adults, children or infants they just want to kill people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. For the better future&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-732.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© Gunduz Aghayev  &lt;p&gt;In this picture the children are trying to save their own future by throwing all kinds of weapons so that they can have a secure and safe future. Due to the increase in terrorism, wars and killings the children are not able to have a healthy future so they decide to throw the weapons away for good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Tourist&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-733.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© Gunduz Aghayev  &lt;p&gt;The tourist is taking a picture of the malnourished child with the animal. This is the sad reality where many tourist use these pictures to gain fame rather than actually working for the betterment of these people. The same is the case for this picture that instead of offering food and clothes to the poor child the tourist is just taking the picture of the child along with his pet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Sweet dreams&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-734.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© Gunduz Aghayev  &lt;p&gt;In this picture the boy is trying to create a home for and the sculpture of the baby is sleeping comfortably as he knows that he is in the comforting environment of his house.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Smile&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-735.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© Gunduz Aghayev  &lt;p&gt;In this the artist is trying to convey the message that the selfie fever has taken us by storm and we have become paranoid. We think that fake smiles are required in order to give an impression to the world that we are famous and happy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Flying cage&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-736.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© Gunduz Aghayev  &lt;p&gt;This picture is of a bird which is flying out of its cage. In this one he is trying to portray that no matter how independent we are, we still stay in our own shackles and cages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Homeland stone&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-737.jpeg&quot;/&gt;© Gunduz Aghayev      &lt;p&gt;In this picture the artist is conveying that the hierarchies are having fun at the expense of the life of the poor man. The man is being exploited in this picture just how the government these days are exploiting us for their own benefits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"17 Illustrations by an Artist Who Had to Leave His Motherland to Draw the Truth","description":"The artist had to end up leaving the country in the year 2014 due to political pressures.
