One on each side of the spine. Kidneys function as the filter in our body clearing it of toxins produced by all the body processes. They do so by filtering about 120 to 250 quarts of blood and producing around 1 to 2 quarts of urine which then flows out of our body. This process helps balance your levels of sodium, potassium, phosphorous, and acid in the blood. Our kidneys are always on duty, throughout the day as well as at night when we’re sleeping.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At times, your kidneys cannot function properly. This is because of consumption of too many medications, preservatives and artificial food. Over exposed to pollution, household cleaning products and other products with strong chemicals in them can also contribute to poor health of the kidney. Because the function of the kidneys is to remove toxins, with poor kidneys your body will not be properly disposed of these pollutants. This can cause fatal illnesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below are some symptoms that your body has way too many toxins and it’s time to stop that now:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Change in Urine&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The product of the kidney, urine can be checked to see if your body has a lot of poisonous toxins. If you notice change in the color or frequency of urine it’s time to be cautious. Dark yellow urine is not a good sign. More abnormal cases could include brown, pink, orange, black or red colored urine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In more serious cases, you could have difficulty urinating, urgency to use the washroom in the middle of your sleep cycle. This could be worse if your urine contains blood or is foamy. This is because of pus or forth in the urine. Pus or forth are results of underlying infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Swollen Face, Feet, Ankles and Face&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1608.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;With urine, excess sodium is removed. For adults, normal urine sodium values are generally 20 mEq/L in a random urine sample. When enough is not retained, excess sodium flows in with the blood. Sodium keeps the levels of fluid inside and outside the cell balanced. With excess sodium the fluids rush into the cells through osmosis and causes the tissues to swell. This condition is called pitting Edema (swollen feet because of high levels of sodium in blood). Pitting edema can be confirmed by smearing force on the swollen area with a finger. If the pressing shows a hollow dent that continues for some time even after the release of the pressure this could be a case of pitting Edema.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Feeling Tired or Having Trouble Concentrating&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1609.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;If you feel tired and lazy all the time, even though all you did was rest the entire day then may be the toxins are to blame. Most of the time you’re just procrastinating (we all do), but if you feel like working yet still your energy’s all drained out then the excess toxins can be the cause. Too many toxins in the kidney can also cause loss of concentration. This is because these toxins cause hindrances in the body functions resulting in exhausting the body and make you feel at unrest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Skin Rashes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1610.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Itchy skin and rashes can also be a symptom of a weak kidney. If you feel that your skin is irritated easily lately, or skin rashes have increased then the quantity of toxins in your kidneys is high. These cannot easily be treated with lotions or creams because they are formed away from the skin surface. They fall deeper than the normal skin rashes. Too much uric acid in the blood causes these itchy rashes. They’re tiny red bumps visible on the skin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Muscle Cramps&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1611.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Kidneys also balance the electrolytes in our blood, for example sodium, potassium etc. Imbalance of electrolytes can cause muscle cramps. When the rate of toxins in kidneys is high you may have calcium levels near to the ground or unrestrained phosphorous in your blood. Both of these environments bases muscle contractions and spasms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Leg Pain&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1612.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Kidney stones and infections can cause aching in legs. The most targeted are is the back of the legs and lower back. If you feel discomfort in these areas it’s better to get your kidney tested. Because the kidneys are located with other vital organs of the body and you cannot pinpoint which organ is not functioning properly without appropriate tests and medical assistance.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;Nausea and Shortness of Breath&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1613.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Shortness of breath may happen as the blood’s pH levels are inconsistent. This loads more burden on the respiratory system. Queasiness and nausea may be experience as these toxins hoard in the blood stream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Prevention and Treatment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1614.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Reading all these symptoms might scare you to death before the toxins could but, here’s the good news. Your kidney’s health is in your hands. Most of the mild conditions can be corrected with a change in lifestyle and health habits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Magic Potion: Water&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1615.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Facthacker &lt;p&gt;Drinking 2 liters of water is recommended for healthy kidneys, hence a healthy body. Make sure to drink your 8 glasses every day, no excuse! Water helps you aid the kidney in its job and wash away the toxins. The major reason for kidney failures is of intake of water. We lose so much water every day in sweating, chemical reactions in the body, urine etc. This needs to be recovered back by increased consumption. The leading cause of kidney stones is lack of water as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Reduce Meat and Dairy Intake&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1616.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Consuming and digesting protein and dairy products have its benefits but they both produce uric acid as a byproduct. Uric acid id one of the toxins the kidneys filter out of blood. Patients of weak kidneys should cut down the consumption to minimal. Replace protein with healthier choices like fruit or vegetables. Fresh fruits and vegetables increase alkaline levels in blood, which helps lower the blood pressure. Lower blood pressure makes it easier for the kidneys to do its job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Switch to Organic, Unprocessed Food&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1617.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Almost everything now has added flavors and chemicals in them. Eating food with high proportion of preservatives, artificial flavors and chemicals causes overload for the kidney. A better choice would be healthier organic foods which are free of additives, pesticides, antibiotics and hormones. Organic foods are available in the market. Or you could grow them in your garden.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Reduce Intake of Salt&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1618.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Salt is guilty of causing kidney failure. Increased salt intake upsurges the toxins in your kidneys. Salt can be found in unsuspicious things like pre-packaged, canned, and processed foods. With too much consumption of salt, your body requires extra water to maintain its intercellular solutions and fluids balanced. Rather than getting rid of water, your body retains it instead. This increases your blood volume meaning your blood pressure. This overburdens your kidneys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Detoxification Drinks and Juices&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1619.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Detox drinks specified for kidney detox can help you jumpstart towards a better kidney. Where plain water provides hydration, detox drinks can provide extra cleaning boost. Beets juice, for example, contains betaine. It has antioxidant abilities and increases the acidity of urine. This can benefit by clearing calcium phosphate accumulation in the kidneys. The elimination of calcium in the kidneys upholds kidney’s task and lowers the possibility of kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lemon juice also is a good detoxification juice for better function of the kidneys. Because of being naturally acidic it helps increase citrate levels in urine. Just squeeze 4-5 lemons into a quart of cold water and drink up (tastes better ice cold). Or squeeze half a lemon into 8 ounces of hot water daily if you have a taste for hot beverages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you don’t like these then there are a lot more recipes for detoxification. The Internet is full of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adapt the habit of eating healthy and drinking plenty of water and your kidneys will thank you. Even if you don’t have an excess amount of toxins or any kidney problem it’s still recommended to take your daily water intake and avoid too much salt in your food, or eating too much of artificial food, just to be on the safe side. All these habits won’t only help your kidneys function better but also save you from many other diseases such as heart problems or skin issues.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;If you feel that you have too many toxins in your blood and kidneys it is better to consult a doctor immediately. Because sometimes we cannot confirm the source of the problem by just looking at it. Medical assistance is required. Lab test and detailed reports can only diagnose the issues properly. This is why it is important to have monthly checkups. Urine test it also really important because not only does it confirm about toxin related issues but also other kidney problems such as diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"5 Signs You Have Too Many Toxins In Your Kidneys","description":"Some symptoms that your body has way too many toxins and it’s time to stop"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/5/123eb179ba072a631fdb8b78e6c46695_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/5/17826a57cbe0c34363e2206346ff2f85_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"15 Ways to Work That Booty at a Buttcamp"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/5/0fc142921d7bcc8ab3297587210a0e85_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"14 Secrets Movie Theaters Are Hiding From You"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
