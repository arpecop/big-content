In fact many of us remember each and every Disney movies we have been watching growing up with. We all become very nostalgic even watching those movies today and remember each movie in detail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But growing up we have realized that a lot of movies contained scenes which were not appropriate while we never noticed them while we were kids. The scenes have had secret innuendos as well as containing adult jokes which should not have been there for young minds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So yes we are going to unveil some of the scenes from the Disney movies which are inappropriate but our young minds were not smart enough to get it at that time. Although with the children of this age it is difficult to hide anything since they have a lot of access to technology at a very young age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if you do not allow them the use of technology they might learn these things from school or other friends because not every parent is able to keep a strict check on their kids. As the parents are busier providing for the basic needs parenting has taken a secondary role.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Aladdin and the King of thieves&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-582.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Although you may not have been able to get the joke at that time but during the wedding of Aladdin and Jasmine an earthquake occurs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then we hear Genie muttering under his breath that he thought that the Earth was not supposed to move until the honeymoon happened. The children watching the movie would not have been able to get the joke, but the adults would have been able to get the Genie’s reference to consummating the marriage would be clearly understood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Bambi&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-583.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikimedia &lt;p&gt;In this movie Bambi, the Disney was trying to test the water with adult jokes since it was the first movie where adult jokes were introduced. It happened in a particular scene where Flower gets his first kiss and then his whole body tends to become stiff and he is seen swelling with blood. Bambi was the first movie in which the movie character Flower was shown to experience erection on the big screen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Hercules&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-584.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;The classic Greek Oedipus was shown to have sexual attraction towards his own mother which resulted in an incestual relationship. When Hercules was leaving the theatre he ended up making a comment that he was shocked to learn about this thinking that only he had problems. Disney has gone up to make incest a very bad joke which should not be one especially in a movie for children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Cars&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-585.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;In this movie the lightning Mcqueen is approached by his female fans who flash the lights on him in order to show their presence to him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This joke hinted towards the fact that cars do not have nipples so they are flashing their lights to gain attention. Although this innuendo was quite hidden it did become a cause of concern when the film was released in 2006.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. The Emperor’s new groove&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-586.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikpedia &lt;p&gt;In a particular scene from the movie, Kronk is sleeping outside and is using the tent to cover his private parts. This is not appropriate because it happened quite in front of the large crowd watching the movie. Although penis jokes are quite common in Disney but this time the joke went too far.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Toy Story 3&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-587.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;In this movie Disney was able to hide a penis joke in one of the scene. In the scene Lotso snatches the lips of Mrs. Potato head, after which Mr. Potato head screams and said that no one is supposed to take my wife’s mouth but me. This went a little too far this time with the jokes.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;7. Cars 2&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-588.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;The villains in the movie are called lemon and they are quite jealous of the cars which are shiny in their appearance. The lemon cars are old and unwanted one and no one wants them to be exact. So the villains decided to take revenge from the cars and after they get done they celebrate the victory by having a lemon party.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now if you do not know what a lemon party is, it is a gay party where the men have sex with each other and are involved in all sexual acts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Wreck-it Ralph&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-589.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;In a particular scene when the Ralph is celebrating the 30th anniversary of his video games and he sees pac man there he ends up making a sexual comment. The comment has a sentence saying that why they called pac man who is “that cherry chasing the dot muncher” which refers to a man who is chasing women to end their virginity and desires sex all the time! This was too much and although the movie was not quite a hit but this joke really validates Disney intentions of having inappropriate adult jokes in scene.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Muppet treasure Island&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-5.png&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;This movie of the 90s was also a subject of Disney’s sexual innuendos and the fact that adult jokes had to be made part of the movie. So in this 1996 Muppet movie Miss piggy ends up having a new man in her life who is a pirate. She explains it to her friend Kermit as “he was a pirate and I was a lady”. The particular statement refers to the real life pirates having a lot of interest in women and being sexually involved with them. It was also thought to refer to rape in a children’s movie and this time again Disney did not refrain from going too far with the adult jokes!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Frozen&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-590.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;The most famous and liked movie of its time Frozen, contained a sexual joke which was both hilarious as well as cringe worthy. In a particular scene when Kristoff is questioning anna about how much she knows him and so he asks her about his foot size. Anna replies to him that for her foot size does not matter which is her giving him an assurance that his manhood size is not a matter of concern for her. This assurance is a true sign of the fact that Disney is never short of sexual jokes!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. The little mermaid&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-591.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;In the little mermaid the cover photo shows a large penis in the background. The rumor is that this was revenge from the Disney artist because he was being fired from his job. But the truth is that the worker said that he was not a Disney employee and this however was a sheer coincidence. But the controversy did not seem to end for this movie as yet! Another scene was a part of the movie where the wedding is taking place. The minister in the scene seems to have an erection but Disney denies this being an erection rather it is just a knee sticking out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. The Rescuers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-592.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikimedia &lt;p&gt;In this movie after 38 minutes a topless women can be seen as Bianca and Bernard are seen whereas Disney claims that it was not placed by the animators.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They claimed that it became part of the movie in the post production process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Who framed Roger Rabbit&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-593.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;The particular scene contains a very bad joke about women. In a particular scene Jessica gets down from the car after the car hits a light post. During the entire ordeal her dress flies up and we see that she is not wearing any panties. This particular scene really questions the ability of the animators and the Disney team that how can they leave such a thing un-noticed. It further brings to light the sexual innuendos of the Disney world.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;In another scene of this particular movie Baby Herman is seen extending his middle finger when he is walking under the skirt of his nanny. Although this scene was edited in the DVD release of the film but it did form part of the movie intially&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Shockingly Inappropriate Scenes in Disney Movies COMPILATION","description":"Disney movies are very famous for entertaining us since childhood.
