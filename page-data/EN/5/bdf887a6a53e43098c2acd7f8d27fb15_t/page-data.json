Or sadly maybe he is just clearing using you for his needs and that’s it. Although you start to see these and your loved ones are pointed these out these red flags, you don’t want to believe it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You tend to feel like you’re in the middle of a situation due to feeling the distance between the other person but also feeling loved by them. At this point, you need to put your foot down and do what is best for you to better yourself as a person. There are 15signs to tell if your man is into you for you or what you have to offer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. He always asked you to do things for him.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-622.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Him being the selfish person he is, would ask you to do random things. They are things that he can do and probably has the time to do but just chooses not to do. He doesn’t care about how your day has been either, he just jumps into conclusion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. He thinks of you at night.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-623.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;He does this so that when he calls or texts you, you think of him too. He wants to play mind games with you. He could try and ask to hangout but he already knows the question is a no because it is too late. He thinks of this relationship like something just to fly by with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Your man doesn’t stick up for you.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-624.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;When this happens, you will see him tend to not care what you are doing. As far as who you hang out with, what you are doing, or who else might be interested in you. He just needs you to be there when he wants you to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Procrastination is his middle name.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can tell when he starts to take forever on things he really shouldn’t. He isn’t putting one-hundred percent effort into the relationship. When he is using you, he doesn’t care if he is wasting your time while you wait.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. He will flake for no reason.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;He doesn’t like planning things because he doesn’t want to seem like he flakes on plans all the time. He will call you last minute and not have a good reason as to why he couldn’t make it. He also isn’t afraid to make you feel insecure about yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Being wishy washy.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One day he will explain how great of a person you are for being there for him and another he can’t even remember to text you back. He will neglect you left and right and you know you can’t always count on him to fall through with plans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. You don’t recognize him when he is with his buddy’s.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-625.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Due to him not being into you as much, he will seem a bit off when he is with his friends because he doesn’t want his friends thinking anything different of him.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;8. Honesty is an issue.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-626.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;He makes sure to tell you what you want to hear, so that you feel better about yourself or the situation you guys are in. He won’t say it how it is because he doesn’t want to hurt you more than he already is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. He can’t stand one-on-one conversations.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-627.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;He hates talking about his feelings with you because he doesn’t see your relationship with him working out in the long run.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6.You guys aren’t on the same page.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-628.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;You both might be moving forward in the relationship but his intentions might not be the same as yours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. He puts you down.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;He hasn’t pulled through with plans for you in a while. You aren’t even on his priorities list.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. He is never convenient for you.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;You need someone that will do anything and everything to know you are okay. Ya… he isn’t doing that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. RESPECT isn’t there.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-629.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;When a guy isn’t into you as much-you might not mean a lot to him. He might treat you like one of the bros when you are around. He also might not respect the people you respect because he has none for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Your always sad.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-630.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;You feel this way when he starts to upset you for no apparent reason. You feel like it could be your fault for him acting like this but it’s not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1.You start to realize things with him aren’t the same.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-631.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock     &lt;p&gt;From he isn’t treating you right to him forgetting about you, you start to notice things more now.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"15 Signs He Doesn't Love You, He's Using You","description":"It is hard to love someone when you are taking the hints that he isn’t that into you as he used to be.
