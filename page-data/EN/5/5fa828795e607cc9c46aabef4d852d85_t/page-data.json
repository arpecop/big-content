An ingrown hair is essentially a hair that curls back on itself, thus growing into the skin instead of growing out. Ingrown hair are most common in people who have curly hair or people who shave regularly. However, regardless of your hair texture and removal preferences, most people are likely to be affected by ingrown hair at one point or another.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not only are these hair not aesthetically pleasing because of all the red bumps and pus that accompany them, but they can also cause infections. The most commonly affected areas are legs, face and the bikini line. Here are a few ways to not only get rid of ingrown hair, but also minimize the chances of them returning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Use a sharp tool&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1303.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;With the help of a sterile needle or tweezers, gently tease the ingrown hair out to the surface. Don’t try to dig out hair that is too far from the surface or you might cause a severe infection. Coaxing the hair out may take some time and patience, but it is worth it in the end. Instead of being too aggressive, be gentle and try to pry it out instead of forcing it out slowly. Make an effort not to cut the skin or damage it. It is not necessary to remove the hair, just make sure that the ingrown end is out of the skin as to not cause infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you see a loop of hair peeking at you from the surface, it means that the hair has already started growing inside. However, such hair is easier to get out on account that you can just insert the needle in the loop and pull the hair out. A rotable medical device is made specifically for this purpose, and it can pull the hair to the surface without causing any damage to the hair follicle or the skin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Use a warm washcloth&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1304.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;To gently coax the ingrown hair to the surface of the skin, you can use the help of a warm washcloth. Apply a warm and moist washcloth to the affected region for a few minutes. This will result in softening the upper layers of the skin, thus making the hair easier to approach. When the washcloth cools down, dampen it with hot water again and repeat the process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you can see the ingrown hair, using a dampened warm washcloth will bring it to the surface. However, if you cannot see the hair initially, leave the washcloth until it has had enough time to rise up to the surface of the skin effectively. If you have been applying the cloth for more than ten minutes and there have been no signs of the hair emerging, it might be too deep for you to remove or something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Use an egg membrane&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1305.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Another thing that can be used to get rid of ingrown hair are eggshells. You need to start by removing the thin membrane from the inside of the eggshell and fully cover the affected area with eggshells. Keep the eggshells on the affected area for a while and wait for them to shrink. Once the membrane has completely dried off, pull it off the skin. More often than not, the ingrown hair is pulled out along with the membrane.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Apply acne medication&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1306.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Another useful item in coaxing out stubborn ingrown hairs can be acne medication. Ingrown hair, especially the ones that are accompanied by pus, are actually very similar to pimples. By applying ointments that contain benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid in them, you can greatly improve the condition of the area affected by ingrown hair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you use the ointment regularly for a few days, the swelling will subside, and the area will cease to be infected. This not only pushes the hair to the surface but also makes it easier to pull it out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Use an exfoliant&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1307.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Regular exfoliation not only gets rid of persistent ingrown hair but also prevents them from coming back. If you scrub the area most prone to getting ingrown hair twice a day, you remove impurities like skin cells, dirt and oil that may have otherwise trapped ingrown hair.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Moreover, exfoliation may also physically nudge the tip of the ingrown hair onto the surface of the skin. To use this technique most efficiently, rub the ingrown hair from different directions so that the pressure will push it to the tip. However, be careful not to be rough when exfoliating. Exfoliate gently, with gentle hand movements, but for long periods of time for the desired result.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Invest in an exfoliating glove&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1308.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Using an exfoliating glove is a cheap, yet effective way of not exfoliating large pieces of skin. Not only does it get rid off all the dead skin very quickly, but it also does so without being too harsh on the skin. Moreover, this method of exfoliation can be used regularly as it does not damage the skin. However, after exfoliation, you should always be careful to hydrate the skin with lotion, or it might get dry and flaky.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Consider using hair removal creams&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1309.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Shaving is one of the leading causes of ingrown hair. Shaving causes the hair to come back sharper, which makes it easier for it to poke back into the skin instead of staying outside. To get rid of this problem, eliminate the practice of shaving from your routine altogether. Use hair removal creams instead to get rid of unwanted body hair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Use a good blade while shaving&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1310.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;If opting out of shaving is not an option, invest in a good blade. It would serve you well to remember that disposable blades are, as the name suggests, disposable. If you keep reusing old blades, the rusty blades will not only give you a bad shave but will also give you a severe case of shaving rash which might result in ingrown hair. Moreover, also get several shaving heads so that you don’t reuse the same ones over and over again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Use a shaving cream&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1311.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;When using a manual razor, one of the most important things to do is find a good shaving cream that suits your skin type. Without a shaving cream, the razor can cause friction burns, making your skin irritated and flaky.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, shaving cream provides you with a comfortable shave, meaning you can shave the hair instead of breaking it off with force and causing ingrown hair. When buying a shaving cream, go for something that is alcohol-free to avoid getting your skin dried up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Go in the right direction while shaving&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1312.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;When shaving, make sure you go in the direction of the hair growth rather than against it. If you go against the natural direction of hair growth, the hair gets cut at a sharper angle rather than being shaved to the bottom. This makes it easier for the hair to cut back into the skin, and cause ingrown hair and infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Minimizing future ingrown hair&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1313.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock     &lt;p&gt;It is as important to care for the affected area, as it is to remove ingrown hair. Use warm water and moisturizing soap before you attempt to remove the ingrown hair. Also, use an antiseptic to lower your chances of getting an infection. After you remove the hair, avoid wearing tight or restricting clothing in that area to make sure more ingrown hair don’t develop in that region.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"How to Remove an Ingrown Hair","description":"Not only are these hair not aesthetically pleasing because of all the red bumps and pus that accompany them, but they can also cause infections."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/5/5fa828795e607cc9c46aabef4d852d85_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/5/6234ebb3bb0721d14edd671a891d6085_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"The Best Ways to Lose Inner Thigh Fat Fast"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/5/54c58639476ff3b602b40dc30e9aa0c5_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Top 10 Bar Trick Bets You Will Always Win!"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
