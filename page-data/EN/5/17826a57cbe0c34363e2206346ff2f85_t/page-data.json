Reverse Bridges&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2202-2202-01-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Get yourself a yoga mat and start your exercise. Just lie flat on the floor, get into a sitting position with your hands at the back supporting you. Your feet should be grounded on the floor with one foot space between them. Simple raise your hips in that position and bring yourself back to the original position. When you raise your hips, keep that posture for 5 seconds and repeat it 20 times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Traditional Glute Bridges&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2202-2202-02-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;This is the traditional way to do this exercise. Just lie on the floor flat and keep your hands straight on your side. Your feet should be placed a foot apart and in that position, just raise your hips and stay in that position for 5 seconds. Repeat this for at least 20 times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Wall Shimmies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2202-2202-03-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Take the wall as a back support and pretend like you are sitting on an invisible chair. Keep your hands behind your head for support and just sway your hips side to side. The movement should be such that you are swaying your hip in the direction of your ears. This will target your core like it is no one‚Äôs business.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Brazilian Butt-lift&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2202-2202-04-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Lie on one side on your yoga mat with your leg on top of the other. The arm that is towards the floor should be behind your head to support your posture and the other hand should be in front of you, on the ground. Simply start by raising your leg towards the ceiling and repeat the process for about 20 times each side.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Heel Toe&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2202-2202-05-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Start from the ‚Äòall 4‚Äôs‚Äô position and kick your leg back ‚Äì just like you do in kickbacks. But when you bring your leg back, bring it all the way to your chest in a bent way. Repeat it 20 times each.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Bulgarian split squat&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2202-2202-06-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;For this you would need a block or a stepper ‚Äì just put your foot on the block and bend your alternative leg, like you do in lunges. Repeat this 20 times each leg.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Back leg lifts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2202-2202-07-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Be on your all 4‚Äôs and straighten one leg turn by turn. Extend each leg 20 times each.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Romanian deadlift&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2202-2202-08-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;This is like a dead lift with lesser weights. Make sure your butt sticks out a little when you go down. Do this 20 times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Clamshell&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2202-2202-09-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Lie on your side with one arm on the ground and other one supporting your head. Bend your legs and keep them on top of each other. Open your legs like a clam and repeat this at least 20 times ‚Äì each leg.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Squat side kick&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2202-2202-10-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Stand straight and extend your leg on one side without bending it and then put your foot down and do a squat. Repeat each leg 20 times at least.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Hamstring curls&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2202-2202-11-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Lie flat on the floor with your tummy towards the ground. Lift your head up and place your arms in front of you to support yourself. Curl your legs together at least 20 times ‚Äì this will hit your buttocks like it is not ones business.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Side lunge to crusty lunge&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2202-2202-12-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Stand straight with one of your leg extended outwards and bend the other leg. Go back into a position with your extended leg crossing the bent leg.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Side Leg Bridge&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2202-2202-13-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Lie straight on your back with your legs bent. Straighten one of your legs and lift them in a 30 degree angle. And in that position do a hip raise. Repeat this at least 20 times each side.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. Pistol Squat&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2202-2202-14-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Stand straight on one leg and the other leg extended in front of you. To balance properly extend your hands in front of you also. Slowly bend the leg you are standing on and go down, and then bring yourself back. Repeat this 20 times each leg.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. Body weight squat&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2202-2202-15-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com     &lt;p&gt;This is a fundamental exercise, we all know how to perform a squat. Just make sure your posture is correct. Stand straight, stick your butt out and then go down. Make sure the distance between your legs is of about 1 foot or so.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"15 Ways to Work That Booty at a Buttcamp","description":"Booti-licious all the way"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/5/17826a57cbe0c34363e2206346ff2f85_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/5/1a1676938daafcecbbcbecc975b89975_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"28 Intriguing Riddles with a Catch"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/5/123eb179ba072a631fdb8b78e6c46695_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"5 Signs You Have Too Many Toxins In Your Kidneys"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
