A very special group. They are the healers, the empaths are the ones to whom the world turns to when things go wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These people have always been the saviors, the nurturers, the helpers and the care takers. As children you would see them protecting other people from getting bullied and standing up for people who could not stand up for themselves. These kids shared their lunch, made sure that their friend’s homework was done – they helped people study for tests and reminded people when tests were to be taken.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-0-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;In a later stage of their life, they turned into the best uncles and aunties. Children in their family loved them to bits. They were the ones that a person would go to for help or to get advice. They are the perfect people to condole you. Whenever someone is going through a bad patch, these are the people you go through.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-0-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;These people are kind and gentle in nature, they have the tendency to love people without conditions. They want to provide people with compassion, love and want to accept people for who they are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Traits of an Empath&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Empaths are highly sensitive&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;These people understand and feel others pain, they like to be on the giving end of a relationship. And most of the time they do not expect much in return for how they are with people. They have warm hearts and they are good listeners. They will hold your hand through thick and thin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-1-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;They might be giving and caring and always there for you but that does not mean that they cannot get drained or exhausted. Even they are human, and there are things that you do that will hurt them. These people usually get the advice that they should toughen up a little.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Empaths absorb other people’s emotions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-2-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;These people are constantly aware of their moods and know what they are feeling when they are feeling it. They feel everything strongly, more than others and it can over-whelm them at times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-2-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;When they are faced with emotions like anxiety, anger or energy that is high in negativity – the push back can drain them. They like to be in environments that are peaceful, quiet and warm. They like to harness love and spread it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Many empaths are introverted&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-3-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;These people can very easily get overwhelmed when they are around a lot of people, their sense of feeling and empathy can completely take over them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shutter Stock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In majority they are mostly introverted people, they take time to open up. They like to interact on a one on one basis or in small comfortable groups. If these people are extroverted, they limit their time that they spend socializing. They need their alone time to recover.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Empaths are highly intuitive&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-4-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;These people have a strong sixth sense. They trust their intuition and it is mostly right. They know that when things don’t feel right- they most probably are not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-4-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;This way they know who to come close to and who to stay away from. People with a strong negative energy tend to drain them really quick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Empaths need alone time&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-5-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;As these people are catering to people all the time, they need some alone time to recover from all that interaction. If they do not take this alone time, they start to get emotionally overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-5-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;They like to take long drives listening to music, or simply sitting on their roof – any place that makes them feel free and comfortable alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Empaths can become overwhelmed in intimate relationships&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-6-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;Being with a person all the time can become too much for them at times. Even in their closest relationships, they like to take time off – for themselves. It is said that subconsciously they are afraid that they will lose their sense of self if they don’t connect with themselves on and off.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-6-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;In order for these people to be comfortable in a relationship – they need their boundaries defined.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Empaths are targets for energy vampires&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-7-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;Such people can easily be a target of someone’s anger and rage. There are people who are looking out for targets to take their anger out on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-7-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;There are people who are called vampires who suck on your energy and where ever they go they make people feel like shit. Such people are sociopaths and narcissists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Empaths become replenished in nature&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-8-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;If an empaths life is busy and jam-packed with back to back activity – they tend to get exhausted. People who have such people in their lives are truly grateful to have them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-8-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;They like to take nature walks as they make them feel calm and peace. Same goes for places like rivers or oceans. It soothes them from the inside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Empaths have highly tuned senses&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-9-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;These people notice and hear things very quickly. Same goes for their other senses, like smelling and even talking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-9-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;They pick up on things in their surroundings very quickly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Empaths have huge hearts but sometimes give too much&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-10-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;Empaths have big hearts and they accept people very openly. They are very good at soothing other people’s pain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-10-1-jp.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;A lot of people cannot understand how these people function at times. They can suddenly feel drained and unhappy – their moods fluctuate as they are taking in so much from their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will find them crying over advertisements and every movie that has a sad scene in it. They feel and imagine themselves in other people’s shoes. And that is exactly the reason that makes them understand other people’s pain better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their friend’s usually tell them to draw lines otherwise people will use them. They are too giving and too forgiving and that is not how it should be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that certainly does not mean that you take a person’s traits and inner self as their weakness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because being like this takes a lot of strength. A person needs to be mentally and physically strong to be this kind of support and help to other people. Emotionally intelligent people get to be empaths.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-11-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;And when these people break down, they will knock at your door for help and expect you to understand why they feel the way they feel. Who they are and what they are is not a weakness but a strength. These people are the ones who needy people gravitate towards, they know that they will be taken care off and nurtured back to health. They have a kind heart and a lot to offer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-12-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;Everyone has a purpose in life and sometimes discovering it can take a very long time. One should know what their nature is like and what their calling is. And choose their careers according to their nature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-28-9-2217-13-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;So do not run away from the things you feel because they will make you wiser and stronger. This is exactly what will make you grow into the person that you were meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Not everyone has the strength that you do – so hang on to it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"If You’ve Been Called Overly Sensitive You Have a Rare Gift!","description":"Extremely emotionally intelligent people"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/5/d88006ed64b97a51bec8256ac0667ab5_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/5/e618e7383956a5b4a481e748bda457d5_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"13 Disney Princess Connections That Will Make Your Jaw Drop"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/5/d7c73a63954e796dbed8e8639c4a5835_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"15 Secrets the Secret Service Doesn't Want You to Know"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
