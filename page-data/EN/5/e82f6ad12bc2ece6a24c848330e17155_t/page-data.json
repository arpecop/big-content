The adorable toddler however did manage to get a bit creative with the lyrics of America’s National Anthem. The two year old toddler’s version of the anthem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Oh, a-say can youuuuu cheeeeee By a dah er we yight What so powwww uh weeee we hayal At dee tye yight’s uhhhh eeee&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After this the cute blonde toddler was about to fall off from her stool which she had been using as her makeshift stage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/c-users-ammar-ahmed-downloads-16-11-2857-02-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Youtube &lt;p&gt;Maddy managed to sing “Oh say can you see” without a hitch she manages to follow it up with a “by a doooot tur weee yight,’ something that would have left the writer of the national anthem Francis Scott Keys, scratching his head as to decipher its meaning.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;The toddler however gets full marks for patriotism, love for the homeland and sheer perseverance. The adorable toddler also managed to finish the national anthem even though she almost fell off the stool stage and said whoopsie daisey however she does not break and continues to sing the national anthem without a break as the voice of a grown up can be heard in the background pushing Maddy on to not stop and continue. “Maddy started singing the national anthem in her brother’s room using his step stool as her stage, and I just had to take a video,” according to her mother Chelsea Dellaca and reported by Caters News.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her knowledge of national anthem at such a tender age seems to be due to her close relation to her father. It is believed that is how she learnt the anthem. Her father forty year old and father of two Andy Dellaca had been practicing to sing the national anthem for well over a year before giving an audition to sing the star spangled banner at a game of the Iowa Cubs who are a minor league baseball team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She learned the national anthem from her dad [Andy] practicing every day for a year before he auditioned to sing it at an Iowa Cubs game during the 2017 season,” Maddy Dellaca’s mother Chelsea Dellaca told the Inside Edition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Star Spangled Banner seems to have struck a chord with both siblings two year old Maddy and her older three year old brother Drew who both had been listening to their father Andy Dellaca singing the star spangled banner for over a year before his daughter Maddy sang it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Dellaca family’s love for the Star Spangled Banner just goes to show that good old fashioned love for America has not died and that despite the fact that patriotism has been getting bad publicity due to such things as the kneeling issue with the National Football League and the ever growing rifts in American society are not universal. Good old fashioned American patriotism is not dead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“She’s been literally singing every day,”  Maddy Dellaca’s mother Chelsea Dellaca said  “A lot of times we’ll sing it in the car. If we’re running somewhere, she’ll just randomly start singing it. She’s just singing it for fun.”&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;Maddy has such a natural talent for performing. Her mother Chelsea has a hunch that her daughter is going to grow up and start a career in theater.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"2-Year-Old Adorably Mangles ‘the Star-Spangled Banner’","description":"A Two Year Old Toddler Messes Up The Star Spangled Banner And It Is  Just Far Too Adorable."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/5/e82f6ad12bc2ece6a24c848330e17155_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/5/ee2e831bbf9eb5920f40b453d46fd8c5_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"What Is Love and What Is Not"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/5/e618e7383956a5b4a481e748bda457d5_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"13 Disney Princess Connections That Will Make Your Jaw Drop"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
