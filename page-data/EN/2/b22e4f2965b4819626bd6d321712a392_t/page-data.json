Several people struggle with losing weight, while others have trouble maintaining their goal weight. Both these tasks require an insane amount of effort, from eating clean to working out regularly. This alone can make the task seem daunting and nearly impossible, more so if you already have a hectic schedule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, to achieve the results that you want, you need to put a little effort in. However, there is great news for all of us! The effort required in getting the body of your dreams might not be as intensive as you might like to think.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Making a few adjustment in your lifestyle, while barely requires any extra effort, can actually bear a lot of fruit. Not only are small changes less time consuming, but they also seem more manageable and less scary. This makes them a great first step towards completely altering your lifestyle for the better or just a way to get good results fast. As it turns out, making tiny adjustments is better for your body as well. Major changes can affect your thyroid function, drastically altering your body and making it harder to keep the weight off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are a few quick ways to effectively lose weight that will take next to no time, but will have a guaranteed impact on your weight loss goals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stay hydrated&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1843.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;A vast majority of us wake up with a scratchy throat, feeling dehydrated and continue to stay that way for the remaining part of the day. A severe lack of water can not only slow down the metabolic rate of a body, but it is also increasingly easy to mistake thirst for hunger. This means that not only is your body digesting food slower, but you will also end up eating more when in reality all you need is something to drink.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While sports drinks and juices might do the trick, they come loaded with calories. An average serving of a drink contains about 200 calories; however, it is less fulfilling than having something to eat. This makes the calories nothing short of a waste. On the contrary, water has zero calories and the innate ability to jumpstart your metabolism making it the perfect drink for slimming down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Trade Refined Carbs for Veggies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1844.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Food items like rice, spaghetti and sandwich roles are chock full of simple carbs which are notorious for wreaking great havoc on your digestive system. While rich in calories, these foods are digested very quickly, leaving you hungry sooner and more likely to overeat in the near future. While you can substitute these foods with whole grain products that are healthier, these products often lead to bloating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, look for substitutes in the form vegetables. For example, rice, a staple in most households, can be replaced by cauliflower rice which are made by grating cauliflower. Store bought chips and dip can be replaced by a healthy snack of carrot and dip which contains complex cards. These take longer to digest; therefore, they make you feel fuller for longer. Moreover, vegetables have great water content, which flushes your system of toxins and boosts metabolism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Do Cardio 30 Minutes a Day&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1845.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;To make sure you are burning calories during a workout, you should pay close attention to your heart rate. A speeding heart rate means the workout is effective. However, different workouts burn calories at different paces. A cardio routine makes use of multiple muscles at a time making it more effective than low-intensity workouts. Good cardio workouts to consider can be spinning, kickboxing and boot camps. Spending half an hour doing any one of these easily torches 200 to 300 calories, all while toning up your entire body to make it look sleeker.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sleep 30 Minutes More a Night&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1846.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;It does not matter how much you normally sleep, adding an extra 30 minutes to your normal sleep cycle can yield surprising results. Whether you sleep for 5 hours or a full 8, sleeping a little more can help you. Being well rested means that you won’t crave sugary foods in the morning, leading you to make better food choices throughout the day. Moreover, sleeping a little extra means that you are well rested enough actually to get in a little exercise before work. So start getting to bed a little earlier to pack in some extra sleep.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;Drink Coffee an Hour before Working Out&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1847.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;According to fitness experts, black coffee seems to be the only exception to the drinking water only rule. A coffee run just before exercise gives you an extra bout of energy in around 11 calories, if you prefer to have skim milk, and only 5 calories if you decide to go black. This extra energy enables you to push yourself harder in the gym while simultaneously making you feel less tired. Win-win, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Incorporate jumping jacks into your routine&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1848.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Jumping jacks are a quick and easy way to get your blood pumping. What makes this exercise even easier and more effective is the fact that it is a fairly easy way to burn calories. They require no equipment, hard to get wrong and fun to do. You can squeeze in a few jumping jacks as you wait for your tub to fill in or your tea kettle to boil to move your heart rate up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fill your plate with fruits and vegetables first&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1850.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Whenever you are about to consume a meal, make an effort to first load your plate up with vegetables and fruit. Filling up your stomach with them means you will eventually have less space for less healthy foods. Moreover, fruits and vegetables also make you feel fresher and more energetic, which can often result in more calorie loss. Go for vegetables and fruits that have not been prepped instead of going for something that is drizzled in dressing. This means that you will be getting all the nutrients, without packing on unnecessary fat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Never skip breakfast&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1852.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;A vast majority of us are in such a hurry to get out of the house in the morning that we forget to eat the most important meal of the day – breakfast. However, what we fail to realize is that skipping breakfast can have a lingering effect on our bodies. It makes us crave unhealthy sugary foods, and we end up snacking throughout the day. Eating a well-rounded and healthy breakfast can jump start your metabolism, ensuring that calories are burning throughout the day. So those 15 minutes that you spend fixing a protein shake up in the morning are definitely worth it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Eat foods slowly&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1854.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Instead of fixating upon how much food you are consuming, try to concentrate instead on how quickly you are eating your food. As a general rule, your body takes a minimum of 20 minutes to register the food that you have consumed and start feeling full. This means that if you chomp down food fast, you will have consumed a lot when in reality your need was relatively less. Eating slowly means that you will not have eaten a lot when your body signals you to stop eating, meaning you consume fewer calories overall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways to slow down your pace while eating. Chewing your food more thoroughly does not only space out your bites but also initiates the digestive process right in your mouth, meaning there is less work for your stomach to do. Consciously putting the spoon down is another effective measure as it prevents you from shoveling food right down your throat. Trying to count how many times you chew your food can be another fun activity to make sure your food is properly chewed when it enters your digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Look into meditation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1856.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;While it might seem bogus, meditation has been found out to have serious weight loss benefits. While meditating regularly might not directly cause you to lose weight, it can have an indirect impact on aiding you in losing weight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A major benefit lies in the fact that it enables people to feel relatively stress-free, meaning there will be less stress-induced eating. Regular meditation can not only help you lose weight but can also help you to maintain your weight. While the optimum time for meditation is a full 30 minutes, you don’t have to devote all of that time to reap most of the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Meditating for a few minutes whenever you feel stressed is enough to get you to focus all your attention towards regulating your breathing, making you more calm and collected in the longer run.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"The 5-Minute Tricks That Will Help You Lose Weight Even If You've Got Zero Time","description":"The effort required in getting the body of your dreams might not be as intensive as you might like to think."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/2/b22e4f2965b4819626bd6d321712a392_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/2/b722696b1822a198cad71420b37c4e52_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Household Items You Didn't Realize Had Expiration Dates"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/2/adc769f70f5fc1a1663ef6bb883db882_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"6 UNORIGINAL Copy Cats of Famous People"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
