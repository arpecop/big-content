The audience simply does not buy all that nonsense since everyone knows it is after all just a movie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having said that, we often come across an onscreen performance so powerful, so convincing that we simply can‚Äôt forget the characters or the plot. The acting and synergy of the roles is so relatable that we wished it was real life romance. Following is a list of such movies we believe truly captured their audience and enthralled them with their storyline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. P.S. I Love You (2007)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-11-12-3385-01-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Via Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;The movie revolves around a woman who lost her loved one and is now unable to cope with life on her own. The death has shaken her to the core and she is flailing helplessly looking for a support. However her dearly departed lover left her a set of instruction on how to overcome her grief.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There also comes another character to give her the motivation to stop living in the past and learn to move on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. The Notebook (2004)&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; the way he looks at her üò©üò©‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Allie &amp;amp; Noah (@thenotebook_movie_) on Sep 14, 2015 at 6:57pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is based on the differences in the social status of two lovers, one is a poor country boy who falls in love with a rich city girl and find an unlikely romance between them. Although the critics say the dialogue and scenes need a bit more refinement but the romance compensates for this shortcoming.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Atonement (2008)&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Morning‚ù§ #atonement #jamesmcavoy #keiraknightley #green #dress #joewright #ianmcewan #robbieturner #ceciliatallis #movie #book&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Atonement (@atonementmoviebook) on Jul 27, 2016 at 12:10am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The movie so realistically captures the two star-crossed lovers that audience forgets it is not a real life relationship rather only a movie. The chemistry between both the actors is outstanding and the romantic scenes are just sizzling hot.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;3. Vanilla Sky (2001)&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; üòª Vanilla Sky (2001) / Director: Cameron Crowe #vanillasky #vanillaskymovie #vanillaskymoviequotes #penelopecruz #tomcruise #camerondiaz #movies #retro #remake // Repost By lovingcinema: #inlovewithactors #couple #lovingcinema (via #IG Capture @AppKottage)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Cirque (@cirque_1111) on Nov 29, 2017 at 3:32am PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The movie is a very interesting concept of a man who has yet to discover his own self in this mind-bending search for love, sex and romance. The movis offers an idea that a man has to choose between the ethereal pleasantries of a make believe life or come to term with the harsh realities of real life. The main character is plagued by this choice but the ensuing drama is very engaging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Me Before You (2016)&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; This movie is sooo great AND I just found out that this actress is #Khaleesi from #gameofthrones üëèüèºüëèüèºüñ§üëèüèºüñ§ #mebeforeyoumovie #emiliaclarke&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Follow Me @dogsandmenüêæ (@jezzebel) on Dec 9, 2017 at 7:27pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes the characters are so dichotomous in their nature that they perfectly complement each other onscreen. This is what makes this movie interesting is the juxtaposition of Louisa‚Äôs character in Will‚Äôs life. She with her colorful and happy-go-lucky attitude is like a celebration in his life as he is more of a conservative guy who needs this kind of pick-me-up. Such storylines are very relatable which makes them more realistic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind (2004)&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; : Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)üé¨ Virtually all of the most bizarre and fascinating scenes in this movie were created with old fashioned camera, editing, lighting, and prop and set tricks. The use of digital effects was very limited. The striking kitchen scene with Joel as a child, was created with an elaborate forced perspective set-up similar to some used by Peter Jackson in The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

She makes every attempt to erase all the memories of her ex. However he holds onto all the time they spent together and try to cherish each and every moment.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;The movie explores the intricate nature of love and how painful it could be to finally let go of someone you dearly loved.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"6 Movies Where the Romance Was So Beautiful We Wished It to Be More Than a Fantasy","description":"Most of the times we see a romantic movie, the drama and dialogue is forced and there is no such chemistry onscreen to make us feel that way."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/2/09789512281324883cfc3c1e17af48e2_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/2/14d43151adae5da2fd750662496bf7a2_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"7 Ways Smart People Use Alcohol to Treat a Cold"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/1/e670e2ac3c588beb7161ca8eff1156c1_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Couple Living 8,000 Miles Apart Keep Meeting Halfway for 3 Years to Take the Same Adorable Picture but Then He Decides to Change Things Up"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
