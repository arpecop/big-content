From basic road design to labelling things wrong, these small details tend to drive OCD driven people absolutely insane. Here are some instances of people screwing up the most mundane of jobs, creating grievances for everyone who sets their eyes upon the problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;19. This misguided designer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1648.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;There is something to be said about overworked designers. This poor designer was so overwhelmed at work that he couldn’t make sense of normal colors. On a pastel pink shirt, he can be seen advertising the color green as the new black. Well to that we would just like to say, what a nice blue shirt!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;18. This obviously shy traffic signal&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1649.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;Some things are so pointless in their existence and lack of utility, that it would not make a difference if they were to exist or not. Such is the nature of this traffic signal. This shy traffic light is facing away from the roads, instead of towards the traffic. This means that oncoming traffic can’t tell when to come and when to stop their engines, making this traffic light as good as useless. It is safe to say that it would have made no difference if they were to remove the traffic light altogether. However, imagine all the traffic congestions this shy little bugger has led to cause!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;17. The mis-constructed Pikachu&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1650.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;Most of us have grown up obsessing over anime, specifically Pokemon. Everyone from Ash to Misty were all little kids and teens could talk about when the show was initially screening on television. Pokemon merchandise production was and still is on an all-time high. From Pokemon cards to action figurines, Pokemon aficionados collect everything. A hot favorite Pokemon was Ash’s very own sidekick, Pikachu. This particular picture of him shows a disfigured action figure with its tail attached on top of its head and it’s ears coming out of it’s rear. It is both annoying and funny to see a childhood favorite this way!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;16. The shoddy car job&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1651.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;Some people take car maintenance very seriously while others decide to just wing it however they can. This particular car got a makeover it clearly did not need. While the car, with the rusty paint and the shoddy tyres, was in a questionable condition from the start, the paint job did nothing to improve its outlook. A mere streak of white splattered all over the hood of the car, the paint job makes it look like a man accidentally swiped a coat of paint on the hood and then decided to quit midway, without thinking of reverting his mistake. It definitely looks like a case of a badly going pimp my ride episode!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. One eyed Anna&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1652.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;For most of us, Frozen stood on the shoulders of Anna and Olaf, the film’s most lovable characters by far. Seeing our favorite character reduced to being a creepy lopsided princess is enough to make any one of fume with anger. This version of Anna has two starkly different eyeballs popping out from each of her sockets making her seem like something out of the Terminator franchise. All we can say to the person who is behind designing this atrocity is that if they ever even come near designing something as sinister as this is, “We’ll be back’. *cue terminator music*&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. This helpful sign&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1653.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;In case of fire, take a hold of the nearest staircase and start hitting the fire until it submits to your will and subsides itself. Sounds about right? Well that is exactly what this sign seems to be insinuating. This fire warning sign depicts a man holding what looks like a staircase and he can be seen, what can only be described as, hitting the fire. While most people can decode the sign as realize that it actually means that you should use the stairs as a medium of escape, some people might fumble as to what the sign actually means.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. This helpful piece of architecture&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1654.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;This atm machine is anything but easy to access. This normal sized man seems dwarfed in comparison to this machine which is clearly installed too high for anyone to access easily. This poor man can be seen hopping from foot to foot in an attempt to get his hands on some cash. While a seriously misplaced piece of machinery, this atm will ensure that you won’t spend as much money owing to how hard it would be to extract it in the first place!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Cycling for the pros&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1655.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;Cycling in the big leagues is not as easy as one might have thought of! This picture shows two alternative cycling paths, obviously meant to be different. However, one of them is a normal cycling path while the other shows a complex series of obstacles that need to be overcome in order to get to your destination. Imagine having to loop your way across the road just to get to work. Now that would be one hell of a workout, both for your glutes and your brain!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Winter is coming&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1656.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;Winter is coming and this clothing store clearly has you covered – not. What seems to be a great example of bad marketing, this store failed to advertise their goods in the right category. Being advertised as winter fashion, this store is trying to sell of its flip flops. While an undoubtedly colorful collection, we seriously doubt these open toed shoes would do you any favors in the freezing cold of winters. Well, who needs toes if you can have red flip flops, right?&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;10. Making do with what you have&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1657.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;Sometimes you don’t have the tools you need or want but at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter how, you need to get your job done. This gentleman seems to be trying to do exactly that. When everyone else whipped out recording devices to record this interview, this man pulled out, what seems to be, a standard TV remote control. We wish we could applaud him on being resourceful, except as we all know. TV remotes are not capable of recording anything. All in all, this seems to be the perfect example of looking busy while doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Baby Carousel&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1658.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;This stowed away baby carousel is anything but a fun ride. Pushed under a rock crevice, not only would it be hard to spot, but it would also be nearly impossible to ride. Even if you would weasel your way into this dwarfed carousel, you would not be able to ride it without scraping your head raw on the solid concrete above. So unless you’re a dwarf, this ride would be anything but fun!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Baking incident&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1659.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;All that this poor guy wanted was to have a customized cake for his party. He put the picture in a standard USB drive and handed it over to the baking company only to have his cake come out with the picture of the USB itself embedded on the face of the cake. This serves as a good reminder of the fact that not everyone operates on the same mental wavelengths as you, meaning that it would make things go a lot more smoothly if you would be clear with what you want and how you want it. Or else you might just end up with a cake with a USB frosted upon it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Food blues&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1660.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;People all over the service industry sympathise with each other about how hard it is to survive in their line of work. Everyone is at their wits end and even the least amount of exterior pressure can result in them getting triggered and blowing up in everyone’s faces. The assembly of this particular burger shows just how passive aggressive food servers can get when annoyed. Not only does this fish filet burger look bone dry, but the cheese slice slapped carelessly on its side makes it look even less appetizing than before. Well at least the first bite of this otherwise dreary burger would be filled with cheesy goodness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. The importance of education&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1661.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;When we are in the middle of studying about continents and rivers we always find ourselves wondering where in the world would we ever get to use all that seemingly useless information. However, looking at this design fail makes one thank all the teachers who taught us the difference between Asia and Africa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Planning level : genius&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1662.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Reddit &lt;p&gt;This rebellious little drain is doing everything except fulfil the purpose he was actually designed for. With great pools of water gathered all around it, this drain remains blissfully dry, oblivious of all the water damage going on all around it. It’s one thing to not instal an essential piece of street equipment and completely another to plan it in such a way that it is deem as good as useless. So much for urban cities being well planned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Mistake or marketing strategy?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1663.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;This man has his face plastered all over the side of what seems to be a city bus, most possibly in lieu of a marketing ploy to gain customers or advertise a product or campaign. However, from the looks of it, this advertisement seems nothing short of a joke. Whenever someone edges a window open, the eyes of the unfortunate pictured man draw impossibly close. The too-close eyes coupled with the squished nose and small set of teeth gives him a certain rodent like look. Well one thing is for sure, mistake or not, everyone will stop and stare at this sign for sure. In fact, it actually could end up doing wonders for sales!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Unfortunate design&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1664.jpeg&quot;/&gt;GallowBoob/reddit  &lt;p&gt;When on your period, it is every woman’s worst nightmare to accidentally bleed through all the defences she has put up, namely pads, tampons, or menstrual cups. Most women, when on their period, are constantly checking behind themselves to make sure they are not leaving behind a trail of blood wherever they go. Needless to say, at times like these, dark colors are your only true savior. However, this lady seems to be going off in a different direction altogether. Instead of being wary about period stains when on her period, this woman is actually sporting a dress with oddly placed flowers that look deceptively similar to the stain a period mishap would leave.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. This hazardous escalator&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1665.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;This escalator is a nightmare for people who can’t seem to get off escalators fast enough. Instead of a normal escalator ending, this escalator ends at a solid wall. This means that in case you don’t hasten your way off the escalator, you will end up hitting your face right onto the solid wall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. This confused superhero&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1666.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur     &lt;p&gt;This misguided superhero is suffering from a serious personality disorder. While the color theme of the bag and the printed logo say superman, this bag itself is intent on being known as Batman. Well in a way this is all for the better. Why have the Superman Vs. Batman fights when you can rally for both the teams at once!&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"19 Times People Had One Job and Failed Dramatically","description":"From messing up basic road design to labelling things wrong, these small details tend to drive other OCD driven people absolutely insane."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/2/e032890449cc4c61764b9ea37761a342_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/2/f4656666b0ff15c891751b0599f432d2_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"11 Ways to Live a Few Decades Longer"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/2/d8b96f165c2b7576d3768628be9e92f2_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"What Does YOUR Palm Say About Your Relationships?"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
