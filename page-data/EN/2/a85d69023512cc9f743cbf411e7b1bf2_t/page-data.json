Nothing can supersede the pain that you feel when someone who you have invested time, energy and emotions in chooses to disregard all your efforts and cheat on you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Society has painted such stereotypical lines within genders that we have all been subconsciously wired to think a certain way. We perceive women as victims and men as aggressors. Thinking that way makes us believe that only men are capable of cheating on their spouses and that can’t be further away from the truth. While some men may cheat, being disloyal is not an attribute that can be linked only to men. Unfortunately, women stray towards disloyalty as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We all know that the real effort goes into maintaining a relationship, instead of just forming one. It takes a consistent amount of effort from both sides to keep the relationship healthy. If one person starts slacking, the relationship is likely to crumble beneath your feet. Here are 10 signs that your wife may not be as committed to you as you think. These indications will help you nip this evil in the bud so that you can collectively work towards building a happy and healthy relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. She is spending less time with you&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-823.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;In a romantic relationship, both the members want to spend as much time with each other as humanly possible. If your spouse is opting out of spending time with you, there might be a problem lurking just beneath the surface.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your wife might start moving in a new social circle, develop a new hobby or start spending more time in the office all so that she can avoid you. While all these habits are probable, if you feel like your spouse is going out of their way to avoid you then there might be a problem worth looking into.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. She is acting distant&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-824.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;If your wife is acting distant all of a sudden, there might be a problem. In a healthy relationship, there is no emotional space between two loving partners. Wives want to be a part of whatever their husbands are doing and are genuinely supportive and affectionate without ever being needed to be asked. If being close to you is not coming to them as naturally as being distant is, a third person might be standing between you two.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. She is suddenly more interested in your schedule&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-825.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;A thin line exists between being overly clingy, and being thoughtful. While it is normal for a wife to inquire about your plans, if she is asking too many questions, it might be a problem. Instead of wanting to care about your day, she might be trying to map out your routine in her head so that she can make sure she does not bump into you during the day. The fact that she is going out of her way to avoid you is suspicious in itself, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. She never parts with her phone&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-826.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Social media has brought about a multitude of ways to enjoy and socialise. However, like everything else, the pros don’t come without the cons. People spend hours loitering around on social media, wasting time left, right and centre. While everyone is entitled to their own privacy if your wife is being overly secretive about her phone, you might have a problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Snooping around in phones is a direct invasion of privacy, so make sure to gather proof before you actually get to this stage or your partner might feel needlessly attacked and overly scrutinized.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. She runs away from intimacy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-827.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Physical intimacy is the cornerstone of any married relationship. Being intimate with your partner is what differentiates a platonic friendship from a romantic relationship. If your married life is devoid of physical intimacy all of a sudden, there might be a huge problem.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;If your significant other is having an affair, it is only natural that not only will she start being less affectionate, but she will also stop initiating any form of love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Small tokens of love, like hugs and other forms of physical contact, everything is a walking testimony of the depth of your relationship. If your spouse is barely touching you, it probably means that she is getting her share of desired physical contact somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. She has started putting in more effort into her looks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-828.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;If your wife has suddenly started paying closer attention to her looks, watch out. Maybe she has shopped for a new look, gotten a drastically different haircut or goes out laden with makeup and perfume.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Either way, all these habits point to the obvious fact that there is most probably someone new in their life that they are bending over backwards to impress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. She is more secretive&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-829.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Make a mental note if your partner is going severely out of their way to be more secretive in your presence. Does she never leave her phone unguarded and go out of the room to answer phone calls? Maybe she frantically closes tabs on her computer the moment you walk in or always browses in incognito? If someone is going to such extravagant lengths to be discreet, the chances are that they have something incriminating to hide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your wife has always been a generally private person, that is different. However, if she has been this way as of late, it would be better if you looked into what was causing this erratic behaviour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. She argues more&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-830.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;All couples, especially married couples, are prone to fighting. If you are going to spend a large amount of time with someone, it is impossible to not fight with them On the other hand, if the fighting is constant and pointless, it might be a marker for something else entirely. If your wife is constantly after your case, she might be guilty of sneaking around your back. Having an affair makes people more irritable on account of the guilt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To deal with your feelings, it is only natural that a guilty partner will start engaging in petty arguments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. She has new friends&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-831.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;When you are a part of a relationship as concrete and binding as marriage, it is only natural that you start thinking of everything as a couple, rather than two individuals. From planning holidays to going out with friends, everything goes through your spouse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, if your wife is suddenly making plans without you, that too with people you don’t even know, there might be a severe problem headed your way. If she is moving in a different social circle, making decisions without discussing with you, the chances are that she is now seeking approval from someone else entirely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. She gives vague answers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-832.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Single or married, no one should be asked to give constant explanations about their every move. However, when you are living in proximity to someone, it is only natural to discuss your plans. If your wife is being particularly shady regarding her decisions, giving vague answers and not volunteering information, she might be trying to hide something.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;If she is going out and says she is just hanging out with friends instead of a singular name, or she does not specify where exactly she is going, it might point to the fact that she is trying to hide something incriminating.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Things All Women Do When They Are Cheating in Relationship","description":"We perceive women as victims and men as aggressors."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/2/a85d69023512cc9f743cbf411e7b1bf2_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/2/adc769f70f5fc1a1663ef6bb883db882_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"6 UNORIGINAL Copy Cats of Famous People"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/2/a7e6a37edac2d1d137585baae49c6a92_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Things Men Absolutely Hate According to Their Zodiac Sign"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
