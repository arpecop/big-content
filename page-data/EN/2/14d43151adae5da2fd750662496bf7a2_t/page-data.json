We are all looking for reasons to consume more alcohol and what better excuse than the medical one, right? Turns out, alcohol consumption can actually help with the most notorious of all virals around: the dreaded common cold. The swimming head, dizziness, blocked nasal passages and sneezing a hundred times a minute while being physically unable to get out of bed may all go away with clever little concoctions making use of alcohol and its healing properties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. A hot toddy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1157.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;A hot and hit remedy for cold is a hot toddy. You will need honey, lemon, cloves and whiskey. Take a mug and squeeze the juice of 3 lemon wedges into it. Add 1-2 tablespoons of honey and top it up with 30 ml of whiskey. Now add 240 mls of boiling water to this and stir to mix. Take a lemon wedge and poke around 6-7 cloves into it and drop it in the mug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bacterial infections may occur when you have had the cold for quite a while. Lemon and honey both have soothing, anti-bacterial properties and may help treat these respiratory bacterial infections before they get out of hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Hot toddy tea&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1158.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;You can also have the above hot toddy with a whiskey and tea combination. You will need ¼ tsp of crushed ginger, 3 cloves, a cinnamon stick, honey, lemon juice, whiskey, some water and 1 or 2 tea bags of orange or green tea depending on how strong you like your tea to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Boil 240 ml of water and brew your tea with cinnamon, ginger and cloves. Take out the tea bags and add lemon and honey to it. Pour 30-60 ml of whiskey into the cup, reheat in the microwave if required and drink hot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. A delicious tonic&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1159.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;You will need honey, water, ginger, lemon and whiskey. Take a ginger root around an inch-long and peel it carefully. Chop it into small bits and chuck in a pot of hot water, around 240 ml. Squeeze half a lemon into it with 1 tsp of honey and bring the mixture to boil. Strain the contents into a glass and top it up with 30 ml of whiskey. Drink while it’s still hot.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;4. Berry and rum tea&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1160.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;It tastes just as good and fuzzy as it sounds. You will need herbal, berry flavored tea, rum, honey and lemon. Brew some berry tea in hot water around 180 ml of it and then discard the tea bag. Add 45 ml of white rum to it with ½ tbsp lemon juice and 1 tsp of honey. Stir the mixture and let it sit for a minute. Microwave if you like your tea very hot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. A syrup for a sore throat&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1161.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;You will need honey, lemon and bourbon. If you have had cough for a while and also suffer from a sore throat try this quick, homemade syrup for some instant relief. Keep in mind to have only a single serving at a time because larger quantities will make your congestion worse. Pour 60 ml of bourbon in a glass and squeeze half a lemon into it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microwave this for only 45 seconds and then add 1 tsp honey to it. Stir it well and heat for another 30-45 seconds. If you feel more comfortable with a watery version then add around 60-120 ml of warm water to it. Drink while it is hot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Chai whiskey&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1162.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Who else had their lips smacking at the mention of chai? This concoction brings together the traditional wholesomeness of chai and blends it beautifully with everyone’s favorite whiskey. You will need around 16 powdered cloves, 20 powdered blackpeppercorns, 1 tsp crushed ginger, a pinch of nutmeg, 8 powdered cinnamon pods, 2 powdered cinnamon sticks with 4 cups of milk and around 89 ml of whiskey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take a saucepan and add the milk to it. Just as it begins to simmer, dash the rest of spices into it and let it cook together for 8-10 minutes. Strain the mixture and then add the whiskey to it. Use honey or brown sugar to sweeten.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. A gaelic punch&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1163.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;It does exactly what it sounds like, punches your cold into submission. You will need zest of six lemons, ¾ cups sugar, 750 ml of whiskey, nutmeg, lemon slices, cloves and some water. Add the zest of lemons to sugar and leave it for 1 hour. Mix it well when the time is up and add 250 ml of hot, boiling water to it. Stir until the sugar is all dissolved. Strain the mixture and add the whiskey. Add 4 more cups of hot water to this.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Sprinkle some nutmeg over the concoction and plop thin lemon slices (around four) with garlic cloves pinned into them. Drink when it is hot.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"7 Ways Smart People Use Alcohol to Treat a Cold","description":"As if you need a reason."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/2/14d43151adae5da2fd750662496bf7a2_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/2/1e8de961701ce2b7d57327f921b167b2_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Gorgeous Mom Reveals She Lost All Her Baby Weight, One Year After Giving Birth to Twins, in Just Three Weeks by Sharing Photos of Her Well-Toned Figure on Instagram"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/2/09789512281324883cfc3c1e17af48e2_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"6 Movies Where the Romance Was So Beautiful We Wished It to Be More Than a Fantasy"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
