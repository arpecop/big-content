But in his endless pursuit of immortality, he has instead of making leaps and bounds, decided to invent antibiotics and consume deep fried chicken nuggets for good measure. But between all of this hodge-podge, the determination and human-spirit of fighting on has not diminished a single bit if that counts as a silver lining. Alas! For what man has learnt from history is that man does not learn from history!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if we really do gear down and focus on the longevity of life and its pursuit, there are some longstanding notions that are perhaps dictum to the fact that some things like being healthy and positive is key to a long life.

We may have the belittling audacity to brush it off like that, but the countless benefits that this habit brings is undeniable. First off, in this day and age knowing what goes into your own food as an ingredient is a blessing and one that can not be understated in any way. Whether it is the calming knowledge that your meat is kosher and prepared in sanitary conditions to having organic, hand picked veggies in your stew, nothing beats the comfort of eating your own home made food. So eat at home and show off the world the fresh new years you add to your timeline by being healthy!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-408.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;It is a little known fact but coffee has for many years been doubted as a silent killer due to its tendency to up your blood pressure needlessly with its caffeine content. Compounded with the fact that blood pressure and resultant heart attacks are the main cause of death in the latter half of life, it is needless to say that letting off the coffee steam is the way to go. Have some green tea instead. It will cleanse your bloodstream and make you healthier!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-409.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Consuming a diet that is lean protein heavy is centric to an ideal lifestyle where you want to delay the grim reaper meeting. Fish and chicken are amongst the white meat substitutes that are the way forth as red meat can increase the risk of several cancers. So eat up on the pulses and white meat and notice how your body has its share of muscle growth while having clean mass and none of the side effects!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-410.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Given how busy most of are, keeping up with our friends starts seeming like a chore rather than an activity to look forward to.

Time to hit up some old friends, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-411.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is no secret that exercising regularly leads to better health and thus, a longer life.

Not only that but it makes for a great way to sneak some much needed cardio in your daily routine!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-413.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;At one point or another, we have all begged our parents to let us keep a pet.

We are stuck in the same rut, doing the same work to home and back routine. While working hard is undoubtedly essential to progress, all this hard work will be wasted if it is being done at the cost of your health and general well being. Meditation can be a great way to unwind and relax. In fact, research claims that meditating everyday for just 10 to 15 minutes can drastically improve your life and add as much as 5 years to your current life span. Mediating regularly restores essential brain cells, lowers the impending risk of heart disease and combats the lack of sleep we all suffer from.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-415.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Most of us are so entangled in the web of life that we find it hard to pry ourselves away from all our problems and get the recommended 6 hours of sleep every night. While our bodies may adjust to this hazardous habit over time, sleeping properly is not without its due share of benefits. Sleeping for a minimum of the recommended 6 hours everyday minimizes your chances of dying in the upcoming 14 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sleeping properly is the most effective way of recharging both your mind and body, while simultaneously stabilizing your central nervous system. Not only will this make you a healthier person, but you will also be more effective in achieving all your goals on account of being healthy and well rested.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-416.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Most of us drudge through our dreary work routines with the fantasy of retirement burning behind our eyelids for all the time we spend imprisoned behind our desks. However, research shows that working beyond retirement age and well into your 70s could mean you get to live a staggering 5 to 7 years longer. Not only does this mean you continue to be a valuable asset to the society, you also never turn out to be any sort of a burden to anyone. On account of being constantly working, both your brain and body remain in optimal health when compared to your peers who stopped working when they hit retirement. Moreover, being useful helps with your self esteem, making your life better and more fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-417.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com     &lt;p&gt;A happy married life can mean adding 2-3 years to your lifespan. Being in a healthy and fulfilling relationship minimizes the sources of stress from your life. Not only do you face less problems from your significant other, but you also get a lot of support in the form of love and care when it comes to tackling external problems. Having an emotionally supportive partner means that you can get through your problems with twice the strength, hence, half the stress. This makes for not only a longer, but also a considerably happier life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"11 Ways to Live a Few Decades Longer","description":"Alas!
