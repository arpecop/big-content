He thought it was a good idea to pose with a live hand grenade after having pulled out its pin. Sadly however he has not survived to tell the tale.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1586.jpeg&quot;/&gt;independent.co.uk &lt;p&gt;The young man Alexander Chechik who went by the nick name Sasha pulled the pin of the hand grenade out and took pictures of himself holding the grenade which was all set to explode. The twenty six year old was trying push the envelope it seems with this daring and bold incident but sadly things went beyond the point of no return.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quite understandably this was not a very good idea and he died on the spot almost instantly as he died in the explosion in the south western Russia. The incident happened in the small city of Labinsk. According to Russian law enforcement officials he did not know that a grenade goes off when you take the pin out and had mistakenly believed that it does not explode as long as you do not throw the grenade. This lack of knowledge about the workings of munitions cost him his life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1587.jpeg&quot;/&gt;independent.co.uk &lt;p&gt;According to reports circulated by Russian media Alexander Chechik decided to flaunt his daredevil behavior and sent pictures of himself with the grenade lying by with its pin out. Evidently it was not the best of ideas and the grenade went off soon afterwards and killed young Alexander Chechik instantly.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;There is no evidence that he ever wanted to commit suicide and all evidence points to this being an adventure gone wrong. Even though his friend panicked and told him not to mess around as the dangers from a live grenade are pretty self-evident and well known the unfortunate Russian was broken in half by the explosion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The unfortunate Russian had sent many of his friends the pictures of what would turn out to be his last moments on this planet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1588.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The incident is also an embarrassing one for Russian authorities and they have said that they are now looking into the matter as to how did they young man get hold of a grenade in the first place. The spread of weapons is a huge problem not just in Russia but the United States and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The incident earlier this year in Las Vegas shows we need to control the spread of munitions as they can and do cause havoc and lead to the needless loss of innocent lives. The incident should also lead to a moment of reflection for American authorities who continue to remain adamant in their stance not to tackle the spread of weapons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The United States has more weapons circulating among its civilian population than any other country on the planet. Yet the power of the gun lobby has meant that the Republican Party at least. Until action is taken against the proliferation of weapons such incidents as unfortunate as they are will continue to remain a tragic reality and will many more countless, innocent lives will continue to be lost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, weapons proliferation happened on a massive scale. This led to a booming industry in illegal weapons as the market was flooded especially in the 1990s the spread of weapons led to large scale warfare in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;There are no reliable statistics on lethal weapons availability in Russia. However this incident shows that getting a hold of such things bombs and grenades remain remarkably easy as the 26 year old managed to get a hold of a grenade. This should ring alarm bells in the Kremlin we can only hope that meaningful action is taken against them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Russian Man Dies After Posing for Photo with Hand Grenade","description":"A young man in Russia decided to take photography to a new level.
