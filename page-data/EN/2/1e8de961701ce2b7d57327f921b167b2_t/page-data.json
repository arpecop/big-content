But now that you have your baby in your arms, it is time to lose that baby weight and get back in your old jeans. And as it always is with weight, this is easier said than done. However, follow the tips below and you would be on your way to your normal body weight. But bear in mind that this might take time according to your body type and metabolism. For motivation take the example of Sonya Davison Sanchez, a television host based in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Get up and get going&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-552.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The best way to lose weight is to move around and about. Even if you feel like sleeping all day, just muster the will to get up, put on your running shoes and go out of the house. Another advantage is that this might persuade you to change out of your pajamas. The fresh air will do you good and if you can take your baby out too with you, do so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wrap the little one in layers, put them in their stroller and go for a walk. If you have a friend who is also a new mom, you can partner up with them so you both can motivate each other for the daily walking routine. If you can leave your baby home with someone you trust, that’s great too. That way you can go for longer runs and have some quiet time to yourself away from all the screaming, crying and diaper issues. A break from routine is always welcome for new moms!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Do not skip meals&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-553.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Most of us go with this option when we have to lose some pounds. We think that skipping meals will make us take in less calories, thereby not gaining anymore weight and losing that which we already have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, this assumption is totally wrong. Maggie Moon, who is a nutritionist based in Los Angeles says that “Sugar is the fuel your body runs on, and if it’s not circulating in the right amounts, every organ in your body is affected and you generally feel tired and unwell overall.” She also impresses that “Without a new supply of calories, your system shifts into starvation mode in an effort to conserve energy. Your metabolism slows, so the food you do eventually take in isn’t burned off very efficiently”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, you end up storing more calories rather than burning them off. So, eat your three meals a day in moderate portions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Eat more veggies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-554.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Yes, we sound like your mom here but this is a very effective way to fill up your tummy without all the extra calories. Vegetables are a good source of many vitamins and minerals and this will help you restore all those nutrients you lose while breast feeding your baby and in turn they would also be transferred to your baby when it feeds.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Vegetables also contain fiber, with dark colored vegetables containing the most of it. Fiber helps to keep your bowel movement regular and every mom knows how important that is! If you don’t like raw or steamed veggies on their own, pair them up with low-fat dips or sauces to make them more delicious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Cutting out impulse eating&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-555.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The stress of caring for a newborn or infant and all those sleepless nights spent rocking the baby can mean that you find yourself reaching for a packet of chocolate chip cookies or a tub of ice cream in the middle of the night. This is mostly because you feel the need for comfort and eating foods we love is a method of dealing with stress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, if this occurs often enough, it can inhibit the weight loss process and instead add on a few extra pounds. Learn to identify actual hunger from stress hunger. And when you feel that you need a cookie or ice cream rather than a wholesome meal, we suggest to substitute sugary foods for something calming. Opt for a mug of green tea or chamomile tea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It would soothe you as well as fill up your tummy. Also, gradually your body would learn to function with less sugary intake and you would feel less cravings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Watch what you drink&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-556.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;As with foods, your drinks can add extra calories too. Being mindful of what you drink can speed up the weight loss process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, researching about what drinks are best in this postpartum period can make you more aware of what your favorite beverage actually contains in terms of nutrients and calories. We agree that new moms need coffee to function and we are definitely not going to mess with your morning cup. However, you do need to watch what else you drink throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Are you drinking carbonated beverages? Or you reach for that bottle of juice? Or is it water that you find yourself reaching for? Carbonated beverages and processed juices have a very high sugar content. A 12-ounce can of regular Coke contains 39 grams of total sugar, which is about 9 1/3 teaspoons of sugar. Processed orange juice has 33 grams of sugar per 12 ounce serving. Therefore, your best bet: water. Reach for your water bottle and keep yourself hydrated without any calorie intake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Put on your dancing shoes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-557.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Yes, dance! It is a great way to burn calories while having fun. Put on some music and get moving. You can also involve your baby in your dance routine and spend some quality time with them. It is fine if you do not know the moves or have two left feet, the goal is to get your whole body to move and sweat it out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even dancing for at least twenty minutes daily for 4-5 days a week is enough to start shedding the pounds. If you want some partners for your dance routine or to stay motivated, you can join a Zumba class, or Hip Hop or Salsa. Even Belly dancing would do! As long as you are moving and sweating, it does not matter which style you adopt.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;So, stay positive and incorporate these tips in your lifestyle and you would start seeing the difference.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Gorgeous Mom Reveals She Lost All Her Baby Weight, One Year After Giving Birth to Twins, in Just Three Weeks by Sharing Photos of Her Well-Toned Figure on Instagram","description":"Simple ways to lose weight after giving birth"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/2/1e8de961701ce2b7d57327f921b167b2_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/2/2205887d07a7fda8a8d438951554c072_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Russian Man Dies After Posing for Photo with Hand Grenade"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/2/14d43151adae5da2fd750662496bf7a2_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"7 Ways Smart People Use Alcohol to Treat a Cold"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
