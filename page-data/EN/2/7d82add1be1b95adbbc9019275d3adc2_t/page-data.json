But what exactly keeps us from finding it? It’s sometimes as minor as our habits. We have compiled 19 tips on how to improve your habits to achieve a never ending supply of happiness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Self love:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2292-1-jpg.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Self-hate and ignorance can feed on you like fire; it can sink you deep into depression and despair. Loving oneself is very important, as it is often the first and the foremost thing you should do if on any step of life. According to teachings of Rumi if you do not love yourself, no one else will love you. No physical pleasure rewards, social status or money can give you satisfaction in life till you love yourself for who you are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A lot of celebrities are now standing up for self love and care, since the capitalist society promotes a certain standard of beauty, which fuels the beauty industry, gathering billions of dollars each month. Freida pinto was an image of self love and care, choosing to keep her uni-brow despite what anybody told her, she stood up to her haters. Happiness always first comes from within.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Try not to complain:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2292-2-jpg.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;When you spend your energy in complaining and finding flaws in your life, your attention will be taken off the stuff that really needs attention. This welcomes negative energy in your inner chakra. Try to focus on the positivity in your life. Try to notice the bigger picture, the meanings behind your shortcomings. Sometimes life does not give us the people we want, but the people we need, to make you a strong resilient person you were meant to be. Maybe you are destined to impart wisdom to the future generation to come. So focus on all the good coming your way and smile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Do not blame others for your misery:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2292-3-jpg.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Try to forgive and forget. Remember hate does not burn the hated but the hater himself. There are both and good people in this world, but the good always prevails over the bad in this world. Tragedy is the essence of human life in this world. But one must learn to get back up when life brings you down, so go make lemonade out of the lemons and move on. Learn to accept apologies that you never got, and forgive those who have wronged you for inner peace and harmony. Let karma do its job, you always reap as you sow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Aiming for perfection:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2292-4-jpg.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;So you are not made to please others, no one is perfect and the virtue itself is overrated. You will be consumed by the drive for absolute perfection. Do not give any heed to criticism or judgment. You are an absolute work of art and do not change anything no matter what the world says. You will one day rise above all the hatred and inspire others, rallying for a change. Be the change you want to see in this world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Not taking care of your body:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2292-5-jpg.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;We tend to feed our body all the trash in the world. This recent trend of fast food and a lot of greasy consumables is doing nothing but harm to our body putting us at a risk for a lot of diseases. Obesity promotes a state of unwellness in the body, allowing it to become a nest for a lot of mental as well as physical illnesses. So start slow, practice self care, change your habits slowly, replacing one meal with a healthier alternative. Start exercising, do yoga and aerobics to keep your body healthy. Love your body for as it is. Commit a few exercises a day, then slowly increase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stop being a slave of your fears:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2292-6-jpg.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Do not let your fears govern all your choices. Fearing the unknown is very common. Anxiety and fear might hold you back, but take risks in life and don’t be afraid to move forward in life. Outgrow your fears, face them, so that you can prosper in life. Take new opportunities, break existing boundaries, excel. Do not hold back from anything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Do not leave anything on tomorrow:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2292-7-jpg.png&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Do or die is the caption that should be on your mind. Do not leave anything unsaid, do not let anything go unheard. Life is very short and unpredictable, so always be prepared for the worst. Be grateful for witnessing a new sun rise each day. Make a daily planner, approximately plan out your daily activities and prioritize. Break your day into smaller parts and reward yourself after the completion of tasks by taking short breaks. Live your live to the fullest, and always keep your mind in the present moment, rather than letting it wander off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Daydreaming:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2292-8-jpg.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Dreaming is a something that everyone should do, have goals and a destination to reach. But let yourself be rooted to the reality always. Be aware of your potential and what you can achieve. However getting too ambitious will also exhaust you completely. Work hard towards achieving your goals each day. Do not just leave your dreams as wall hangings in your lounge that you reminisce about in the future, go out and grab it while you are still young. The world is filled inspiring individuals who have stopped at nothing but touching the moon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Do not maintain a firm grip over the past:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2292-9-jpg.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Leave your fears and the horror in the past. Move on. Today is a new day, which represents a new opportunity that has come knocking on your door. Just let it go, like Elsa’s song from frozen, let the pain remain in the past. In order to grow and achieve something one must not dwell in the past. The past holds wisdom, just learn that and move forward. Practice meditation and mindfulness so that you learn to live in the present.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ending up with the wrong people:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2292-10-jpg.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;You should not be afraid to end up alone but ending up with the wrong company. Your friends and relationship defines you. Do not internalize the toxicity that others throw at you. If people are hurting you try to move away. Break free from the shackles of bad relationship. Find people that appraise you and thrust you forward in life. The earth is inhabited by eight billion people do not waste time, with the few that throw negative energy at you. Learn from them and move forward in life.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;Not recognizing your self worth:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2292-11-jpg.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;As Rumi said, you are not a drop in an ocean, but an ocean in itself. Never underestimate your abilities. Do not absorb the negative energy and what people say about you. You have the entire set of abilities you need to excel in life, so let nothing hold you back. Recognize your true worth and celebrate your achievements with those who love you, so you get encouragement to continue and excel. Do what you can to practice self care, and go after those who try to hurt your strength and confidence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Strive to meet your expectations in life:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2292-12-jpg.png&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Create goals for yourself, and strive for a better tomorrow. Compete with yourself rather than others. Be a better you each day. You are a person with unique experiences, do not let yourself become mediocre by competing in a cat race. Stand out from the crowd, achieve your true purpose and inner calling. You face your own challenges so do not limit yourself by what other do or don’t do. Live and let live.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Do not let the negativity sink in:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2292-13-jpg.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;It is a dark world, do not let bullying or others attitudes affect what you do in your life. Be your own person, find peace in solitude. Spend some me time, taking care of your soul and body. Invest in a day out at the spa, or preparing healthy meals for the week, drop in a desert or two. Go for a morning jog, let your body breathe and rehabilitate. Slow down and appreciate nature. Go for a vacation. Do not rush things, and you will see the magic unlock in your life. Your home should be a safe haven from evil things and negative energy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Do not just run after money:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2292-14-jpg.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Money is an integral thing in life, but it does not replace the feeling of emptiness or love in your life. Go chase your dreams and don’t be afraid to slow down. Do not be carried away by the craze of the fast urban life. Give time to those who love you, your family and friends. Talk to your parents, drop a text or two to tell them they are loved. Celebrate holidays with your favorite squad. Make memories rather than just running after materialistic commodities. Money is replaceable but your time is not, so do not be away from your family giving the excuse for money. Diamonds will come, just create a tasty dish and enjoy a dinner together, which is something you will always remember.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Don’t shut down:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2292-15-jpg.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Do not let narrow mindedness consume you. It is essential to hang onto one’s beliefs or opinion, but making them as the only rules that must be followed, it will lead to inevitable doom. Let others in, take their advice and positive criticism. Grow and evolve with new age and time. The technology is growing at a fast pace, and so is the world around you. Adjust, refurbish and break down existing boundaries. Be open to unconventionality and new ideas, remember in order to move forward one must adapt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Being carried away by social media:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2292-16-jpg.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;We often get intimidated by perfect lives that other people around us seem to enjoy, we have let social media cage us in this digital age. Gone are the days of old fashioned letters and family events and huge gatherings. People increasingly feel a need to validate their experiences on the social media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Selfies are the new talk of the town, and people will do anything to outdo the other often putting themselves in harm’s way as they do that. The media portrays the perfect life of celebrities using it for its own advantage and materialistic benefits. Do not give into the pressure to live your life a certain way due to the masses, allow yourself time to grow in your own pace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Balance the yin and the yang:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2292-17-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Life does not entirely have to be black and white but sometimes it is grey. Memories can be both happy and sad, so can be a lot of experiences. Things do not need to be a all or none phenomenon. If you could not do it today try harder tomorrow. Get back up and do not let anything hold you down. Life is all about striking that balance and taking the middle road. Work hard, but also find time to treat yourself in the process. Go after your dreams, but do not put time boundaries to make it all harder. Be easy on yourself, because the world won’t unless you do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Go with the flow:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2292-18-jpg.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Yah, just let nature lead you on, do not waste your energy in fighting the flow.

Do all you can, but if things do not turn out to be favorable may be embark on a different journey that proves to be fruitful for you? Find inner peace and harmony, just like Master Shifu become one with the universe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Prioritize:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2292-19-jpg.png&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;This is a simple rule in life that one must follow. You cannot be at all places at once or achieve everything, learn to accept your shortcomings and build your goals around it. Accept what you can and can’t do. Give value to some things in life, and be smart enough to make informed choices, as time waits for no man. That special dress you always wanted may not be worth it, maybe give real happiness to that girl who needs it more than you for her prom? Share and care. Always learn to give people. Decide what things are truly worthy of your time and take it from there. Most important of all, never give up!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Here are 10 things you should tell yourself every day to stay strong.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;1. Other’s opinion matter, but I make the final decisions in my life, because no one else is walking in my shoes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2. I acknowledge my feelings, thoughts, needs and wants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3. It is alright if others do not agree with me, everyone has their own point of view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4. I can be there for others without taking on the emotional burden.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;5. My priorities are clear and I can effectively express them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;6. The outcome of my actions and decisions is my responsibility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;7. I equally enjoy being in company and spending time to myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;8. I am capable of adjusting well to change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;9. I can stand up to injustice and unkindness, towards me or someone around me.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;10. I feel good, and not guilty when I take care of myself.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"19 Signs of a Healthy Self","description":"what exactly do you need to make your pursuit of happiness in life successful?
