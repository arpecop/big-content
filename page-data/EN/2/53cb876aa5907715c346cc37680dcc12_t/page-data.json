They are either space cadets or just not that into you. But don’t worry! There are some easy ways to get the interest of your latest crush.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;We think it is easy to get a guy’s attention, but that is not true. There is so much going on in our lives that we don’t give time to anything that we think is not worth it the first time around. Although we should give a second thought, a second look at the things in our environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-2-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;Men are not as complicated as women. They are simplistic in nature and once we understand that we should not find it very hard to get the guy we want. Simple things that will just make him stop and look at you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-3-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;There are ways to do these things right, and if you manage to – he will be downright obsessed with you. He will start to adore you in ways – even you didn’t think it was possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-4-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;But don’t get your hopes a little too high, because every person is a unique individual and some people are way more difficult and stubborn than others. Or they are just simply not interested. But if you start working on these, and they work – you will find that he can’t get his mind off you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-5-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;Here is a list of 15 things that you should always follow, and your soulmate will walk right up to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#1 Always be yourself.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-6-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;No, there a million things you do to impress people and you forget that you are not being yourself. We don’t even put too much thought at that point in time. But you need to put thought into the fact that whenever you ask someone for an advice, this is the first one you get.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-7-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;Even along the way, without realizing we start doing things that the guy would like instead of just strongly sticking to who we are really are. We are so afraid of being rejected or not liked that in fear we don’t realize that we are losing our ground.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#2 Be as confident as you can be&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-8-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shutter Stock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is as common as the last advice, but it is as important. The more happy and confident you are, the more people will be attracted to you. Same goes for your crush, he will instantly know that you stick out and will be attracted to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-9-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;It shows that you believe in yourself and sure of it. You have your shit together and men find that attractive. Not everyone likes a damsel in distress – only weak men do. So go ahead and throw your insecurities out of the window.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#3 Remember to respect yourself&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-10-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;Nothing is a worse put off than someone who does not respect themselves or has a low self-esteem. Men want to respect women, and you can’t respect someone who doesn’t maintain it or even do it themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-11-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, it is all in your hands. Someone who has to respect you – will. And someone who doesn’t respect anyone, even themselves – they will never.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#4 Maintain your standards&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-12-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;If someone is overstepping their welcome or being too quick to get to the second step, put your foot down. Don’t be afraid that if you don’t give them what they want, they will move on to the next one. And if they even do move forward, that is good for you. Unless you want it to be a one night stand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-13-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;But having and setting standards you show that you have a sense of self-respect. And this is how you show it, by defining your boundaries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#5 Be kind – Always&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-14-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;People notice how people behave with other people, and how you treat your loved ones. So it is not just about how you are with them, so always remember to be kind. The person who is into you will look at your first impression and many more followed by that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-15-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;Showing that you are a good person and have a lot of love and kindness to give makes you more valuable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#6 Put your demands out there&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-16-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;By this we don’t mean that you should unreasonably demand things that you want. There is a fine line between being demanding and bossy. It should be enough to know that you can handle things and you are not a weak-ling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-17-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;There are a few men who always need to be in charge to feel important. But in reality, it’s a sigh of relief also.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;#7 Take care of yourself&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-18-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;By this we do not mean that you should dress up all the time and look like a hot model. This just means that keeping yourself taken care of is a part of attracting and keeping people in your life. Hygiene, mental and physical health is very important. You cannot pour out of an empty jug and people out there are not looking for adopting a baby.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-19-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;If you can’t be responsible for yourself and take care of yourself, what are you possibly going to give someone else?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#8 Try and be subtle&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-20-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;Trying too hard never works, so always keep it natural. If you want to show him things or communicate that you like him, don’t be too ‘in the face’ – be a little light and subtle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-21-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;Dropping hints is the right way to go about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#9 Try and not be reserved&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-22-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;You can’t expect a person to go crazy over you if you don’t open up to him. One needs a certain degree of vulnerability to get to know someone. Give them enough information so they look forward to more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-23-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;No one wants to be with someone who bores them and doesn’t tell them anything about themselves. It is important that you show him your real self, and make your beliefs and how you think clearly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#10 Be as spontaneous as possible&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-24-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;If you have developed a comfort level with this guy, surprising them with some comfort food and beer would not be a bad idea. Everyone wants to lay back some times and not cook.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-25-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;Having a good time snuggling and eating pizza together is a great way to bond.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#11 Keep your life full&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-26-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;Do not be co-dependent, make sure you have your own life. Because if you end up clinging to someone, that can end up being a ‘put off.’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-27-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;You cannot spend time together all the time, you need to be productive in life and have your own set of friends to chill out with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#12 High maintenance girls are a put off&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-28-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;Men might like the way you look but not when it becomes a hassle. No one wants to wait for three hours for you to get ready. They want to keep it easy and simple.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-29-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;This does not just apply to how you look, it applies to your needs also. Constantly wanting someone, or being clingy can become a headache. Everyone needs their space, so make things easier for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#13 Accept people the way they are&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-30-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;The best way to get under someone’s skin is to accept and love them – the way they are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-31-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;When a guy feels comfortable around you, he would want to spend more time with you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#14 Be supportive of his dreams&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-32-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;Even if you think his dreams are ridiculous, you shouldn’t shut him down. You should support him in whatever he wants in life – he will love you more for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-33-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;Men who feel that they are supported by their love interest. These things mean everything to him and you supporting him just makes you feel more for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#15 Have your own ambitions.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-34-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;Being ambitious in life is very important, as much as you are free to give attention to your loved ones – not having goals in life is a put off. Everyone should be productive in life and want to be something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-zainab-afridi-downloads-3-10-2284-35-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock     &lt;p&gt;These things define who are you and who you want to be. This shows that you want to grow in life and not be stagnant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"15 Classy Ways to Make a Guy Go Crazy over You","description":"Stand true to yourself and you can be with whoever you want"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/2/53cb876aa5907715c346cc37680dcc12_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/2/5a9f34cc64af291d62713763434733c2_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"The Zodiac Signs with the Strongest Intuition"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/2/4e18df4adeaf62b1a236c62a8022b472_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Signs You Should Slow down a Relationship NOW"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
