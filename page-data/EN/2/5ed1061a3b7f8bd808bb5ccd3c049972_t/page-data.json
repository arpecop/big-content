One must discipline themselves and just know that there is no easy way out in order to achieve your fitness goals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However when we turn to Instagram or other social media there are people who are always posting their transformational before and after pictures which is actually done with few simple tricks. It could be the camera angle or the lighting, even tweaking their posture and clothing makes a huge difference to how they appear in a picture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This visual trickery is not to deceive their fans but something far more important than that which these fitness enthusiasts are trying to propagate. These before and after images are done deliberately in order to make people realize that there are certain angles which make your body look fat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is more important is to love your body image despite the usual norms of having a six pack abs or washboard flat stomach. These pictures are an exercise in making people value their own individuality and not be influenced with popular fitness ideals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So next time you are browsing through online and seeing these perfectly chiseled fitness models just realize there are fifty or more pictures which were discarded before the one you are seeing is uploaded. So it is better not to compare your own body image with pictures you see online.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; You girls requested for me to share this after posting on snap last week üòä Picture on the left was taken one day before the wedding and the picture on the right was taken‚Ä¶ 2 minutes after! Someone recently said to me that we all have our good angles and we all have our bad angles, so why do we let our bad angles carry so much more weight than our good angles? If you focus on how bad you look in the bad angles, at least focus on how good you look in the good ones too!! üòÑüíÅ Tag a friend if you found this helpful üíó #fbggirls #loveyourself #realstagram www.annavictoria.com/guides&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  Anna Victoria (@annavictoria) on May 22, 2016 at 9:45am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anna Victoria posted her picture from a side angle and tried to illustrate that not everyone looks always there best so it is better not to stress out too much about how you look all the time. The reason behind this photo was to educate people that if you like yourself much in your good angles then don‚Äôt be too hard when you take pictures from bad angle. It‚Äôs a pretty normal and infact natural body flaw which need not be seen as something negative.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The picture below again drives the same point home that do not be concerned or feel bad with your body at certain angle.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Me 1% of the time vs. 99% of the time. And I love both photos equally. Good or bad angles don&#39;t change your worth ‚ù§Ô∏è I recently came across an article talking about how one woman stated she refuses to accept her flaws, because she doesn&#39;t see them as flaws at all. I LOVED that because it sends such a powerful message that our belly rolls, cellulite, stretch marks are nothing to apologize for, to be ashamed of, or to be obsessed with getting rid of! As I&#39;m getting older, I have cellulite and stretch marks that aren&#39;t going away, and I welcome them. They represent a life fully lived (for 28 years so far :)) and a healthy life and body at that. How can I be mad at my body for perfectly normal &amp;quot;flaws&amp;quot;? This body is strong, can run miles, can lift and squat and push and pull weight around, and it&#39;s happy not just because of how it looks, but because of how it feels. So when you approach your journey, I want you to remember these things: I will not punish my body I will fuel it I will challenge it AND I will love it üíóüíóüíó If you&#39;re following my page, you&#39;re a part of helping me spread this message and creating this movement ‚Äì thank you. #fbggirls #realstagram www.annavictoria.com/guides&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  Anna Victoria (@annavictoria) on Jan 16, 2017 at 3:12pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact what is more important is to feel good. If you are feeling good about yourself you will not bother too much with your body image.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Oh oh it&#39;s magic, you knowwwwww. üé∂üé∂ We all look like this when we sit. Don&#39;t stress about the way your body looks in certain positions. These photos were taken 2 minutes apart!‚ö°Ô∏è#noedits Thanks for the inspiration, my super human being friend @emilyskyefit&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  jenwiderstrom (@jenwiderstrom) on Sep 18, 2016 at 12:01pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Weight loss expert and personal trainer on ‚ÄúThe Biggest Loser‚Äù T.V show Jen Widerstorm has taken this picture only two minutes apart. The point is to show that your body no matter how toned you might think it is even then it will have its imperfections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These imperfections like the stomach rolls when one sits despite having six-pack abs suggests that these online images do not share the full story. They are only projecting the best of the best image while discarding those ‚Äôimperfect‚Äô ones. Now if we are to consider these online images as the standards of beauty we will surely set ourselves some highly unattainable goals.&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt; üö® This is not a transformation photo üö® This week I&#39;ve decided to do the 30 second transformation photo. These pics were taken second apart this morning. On the left my posture is poor, I&#39;m pushing my belly out as far as possible, I adjusted my bottoms to show my gross, unsightly and horrid love handles. These are often concealed by my high waisted pants and bottoms that do fit so much better now. As much as it pains me to showcase these, it also proves that my body isn&#39;t perfect and that I still have work to do and fat to lose (I&#39;m working so hard to get rid of my love handles and lower tummy fat. Yes it has dramatically reduced already but it still exists and I&#39;m still insecure about it). On the right I&#39;m standing straight and comfortably. I&#39;m lightly flexing and I&#39;ve adjusted my bottoms to hide my love handles. I&#39;m thankful for bikini bottoms that now fit well and hide these but I&#39;m also trying to show that they still exist quite a bit and that not everything we see meets the eye here on social media. You can show you best angles and hide your flaws but at the end of the day what we chose to showcase is a reflection of ourselves. My body isn&#39;t perfect. I still have imperfections and flaws that I&#39;m slowly learning to be comfortable with. I want to be real and honest and open. Yes I&#39;ve accomplished a lot, but yes my body still has less than ideal days when it doesn&#39;t look its best. Fitness and health is not a fix. It&#39;s not a destination. It&#39;s a lifestyle. If you force your progress you know who you are cheating?! You. You only cheat you. Yes I like to show my best most of the time but I&#39;ve also realized by not showing my worst that it only harms myself. Being vulnerable and imperfect is hard but lying to yourself is worse. I know I&#39;m hard on myself, it&#39;s a flaw on its own, but I&#39;m slowly learning to be gentle and kind but it starts with being truthful to myself and knowing and understanding my imperfections and realizing that, although they exist, they don&#39;t define me. I am not a before picture. I am not an after picture. I am not fat nor am I perfect. I&#39;m flawed. I&#39;m scarred. I&#39;m insecure. But I&#39;m learning and I&#39;m hopeful that one day I&#39;ll fully love me üíï&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  Jess : Orlando, FL ‚òÄÔ∏èüåäüå¥ (@plankingforpizza) on Feb 9, 2016 at 7:03am PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jess Peck is a life coach and in this picture she reveals how people can easily fake their before and after pictures. In the picture on the left she deliberately adopted a poor posture and form. She also wore her bikini bottoms a little lower on her waist so that her love handles showed more visibly. She also did not flex her stomach and let it hang loose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now picture on the right is only seconds apart but she made certain tweaks to her bikini bottoms wearing them a little higher. Also adopted a more upright posture and flexed her stomach a little. This is what it really takes to project a more attractive image online which we take to be something that is permanent or that these models may look like that 24/7. This shows how utterly misleading online images can be.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve done a posed vs relaxed but I know how many of you guys love them ‚ù§Ô∏è . Both of these poses are beautiful. The media would try to tell me only one of them is but NAAHHHH because that comes from an ignorant, one-sided, profit making, beauty ideal that I AINT HERE FOR. . Our bodies move, grow and change shape all day everyday. It&#39;s been hounded on us for so long that only a still image in which we are posed and tensed is beautiful but it&#39;s simply not true‚Ä¶ jiggle, rolls, fat, cellulite, extra skin (fanx pregnancy I love ya) are glorious, beautiful and REAL. . I could &#39;pose&#39; all my photos, make myself fit a little better into the mould that society wants me to but then i would miss out on being my glorious self, further strengthen the hold the media&#39;s &#39;beauty ideal&#39; has on us and put out a message I don&#39;t want to send‚Ä¶ . Love yourself for who you are in this moment ‚ù§Ô∏è . These are not control underwear, just high waisted briefs and my underwear set is from @bouxavenue&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  üëë‚òÄÔ∏èüåªüíõMILLYüíõüåª‚òÄÔ∏èüëë (@selfloveclubb) on Sep 8, 2017 at 11:03am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emilly Smith is known for advocating body positivity and how to be more comfortable with your body image. She is against the media hyped standards and her Instagram is full of such pictures which show how false a before and after picture could be online.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Same girl, same time. „Ä∞ Spanx etc can change your body hugely. Control underwear is everywhere. Companies telling us to smooth our lines, control and flatten our tummies, Nip in or waist. Forever making us feel not good enough, not societally perfect enough. Every celeb under the sun has even sporting waist clinchers and control Spanx and many of us compare our natural form to these control garment figures „Ä∞ You don&#39;t NEED to change a thing or sweat your ass off in a tight uncomfortable garment under your clothes. You don&#39;t need to suck in anything or change the shape of anything. (Of course if you want to then that&#39;s okay too- the difference between wanting to and NEEDING to/feeling like you HAVE to is key) „Ä∞ Both these photos are beautiful to me, the difference here is that I feel far more comfortable on the right mentally and physically. The photo on the left isn&#39;t how my body actually looks and I&#39;m uncomfortable with that. The photo on the right is me, my natural form and to me, personally it&#39;s the most beautiful thing to be comfortable without the need to changeüíú „Ä∞&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  üëë‚òÄÔ∏èüåªüíõMILLYüíõüåª‚òÄÔ∏èüëë (@selfloveclubb) on Apr 8, 2017 at 12:14pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;She is all about loving your own self and not be too intimidated with the often bogus and phony images online.
