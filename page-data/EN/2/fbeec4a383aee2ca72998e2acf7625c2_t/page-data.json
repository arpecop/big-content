You know the worst part of being a Disney child star? There comes a moment in their lives that they become total train wrecks. Maybe for a short while and they might recover but still that phase does come.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s a list of 20 Disney child stars, gathered by &lt;strong&gt;Tapoos&lt;/strong&gt;, who have definitely changed a lot after leaving Disney.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ross Lynch&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;Lets grow old together&amp;quot; – Here Comes Forever by R5&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Ꭱoss Lynch (@rossr5) on Mar 24, 2013 at 7:10pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; You guys! My Friend Dahmer will be premiering at the 2017 @Tribeca Film Festival. I am so excited for you to see it! #Tribeca2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Ꭱoss Lynch (@rossr5) on Mar 2, 2017 at 12:15pm PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ross Lynch played Austin in the Disney Channel show “Austin and Ally”. He immediately became our favorite but when his Disney days finished, he started to take some adult roles in darker movies. He’s kinda freaking fan girls now instead of thrilling them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Zendaya&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; guess who&#39;s your new XOUT girl!??!??! @xout&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Zendaya (@zendaya) on Feb 3, 2014 at 8:12am PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; @wonderlandmag cover😍 (I see what y&#39;all saying by the hand placement lmao but that was not intentional you little pervs😂😂😂)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Zendaya (@zendaya) on May 25, 2016 at 12:11pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zendaya played Rocky Blue in “Shake it up”, a Disney Channel show. She’s for sure not a kid anymore and gladly not so ‘ruined’ like other Disney stars but what’s going on in this picture? This magazine cover is definitely showing indications of something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mitchel Musso&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; ⚾️🐻⚾️&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Mït¢he!

(@mitchelmusso) on Feb 24, 2017 at 12:07am PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mitchel Musso starred as Oliver in our favorite Disney Channel Show “Hannah Montana”. In the show, he played Miley’s best friend. He’s definitely grown up now and was arrested in 2012. If you see him now, he’s full of tattoos and looks like a tough guy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Vanessa Hudgens&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Who is ready for a #TBT?

But in 2007, some revealing pictures of hers were leaked. She did apologize but it was repeated again in 2009 and not to forget, it happened again in 2011.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Debby Ryan&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; #ThrowbackThursday to the 4th of July, 2010.

Well, she was arrested I 2016 for drunk driving and she even apologized to her fans on twitter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Demi Lovato&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; #demilovato #demi #lovato #young #youngdemilovato #brownhair #hair #beautiful #perfect #perfection #demilovatomakesmehappy #demilovatosmiling #staystrong #staystronglovatics #unbroken&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Demi Lovato (@demilovatomakesmehappy) on May 29, 2012 at 12:45pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; #TellMeYouLoveMe 💚 demilovato.co/spotify @spotify 📷: @angelokritikos&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) on Sep 29, 2017 at 4:20pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Demi Lovato started her career quite early when she starred in “Barney and friends” and then she was the lead actor in the Disney Channel original movie “Camp Rock”. And now if you look at her, she has been posting some spicy pictures of herself on social media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lalaine&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; #WeekFace #Tbt&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Lalaine Vergara (@thelalaine) on Sep 24, 2015 at 4:37pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Even shorter though.

Well, after that, her career went down the hill. She was arrested in 2007 for possession of an illegal drug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Brandon Mychal Smith&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; #mcm #brandonmychalsmith&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Arianna, Aiden, &amp;amp; (Mommy)Tabby (@tab_n_theateam) on Jun 30, 2014 at 10:05pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Happy 27th birthday to @BrandonSmithCeo 🎊🎉🎇🎆 #BrandonSmith #BrandonMychalSmith #Zoey101 #SonnyWithAChance #NicoHarris #SoRandom #Starstruck D.o.B: May 29th 1989&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Birthdays- famousbirthdays.com (@famousbirthdays21) on May 31, 2016 at 11:25am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brandon has starred in many Disney Channel shows in which one of them was Sonny with a Chance alongside Demi Lovato.

Well, she did something which wasn’t to be done by a Disney star and that is to ‘leak her own nudes by HERSELF’. She did it to get more fame.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Which Disney movie star were you most disappointed from?
