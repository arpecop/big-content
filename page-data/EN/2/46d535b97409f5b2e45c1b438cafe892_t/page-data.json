Your SO seems like the best person in the world, you consider yourself lucky for having found them, they make you smile and every night is date night. The romance is new and fresh and you couldn’t be happier. Somewhere along the way, you may feel that things have changed. Rough patches hit every now and then which can leave you wondering if the relationship you’re in is even worth the effort at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Arguing with your SO is nothing out of the ordinary and not something which should make you re-think your relationship, unless there are far deeper and more serious issues involved. “A good fight can clear the air, and it’s nice to know we can survive conflict and even learn from it. Many couples, however, get trapped in endless rounds of fighting and blaming that they don’t know how to get out of,” says Harriet Lerner, Ph.D., on Psychology Today “When fights go unchecked and unrepaired, they can eventually erode love and respect, which are the bedrock of any successful relationship.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So how can you tell if you should put on your running shoes and run as swiftly as you can in the opposite direction or if you should stay and make things work. Following are 9 questions you should ask yourself before deciding to repair your relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-98.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the most important question of all. When you still feel very much in love with your SO, like you did at the beginning of the relationship, then by all means do your very best to save your relationship. True, fierce love does not wane when faced with challenges and laced with arguments. But if the motivation to work at the relationship feels like too much work and you’re already looking for an exit door, then you have the answer already.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gestures of love release Oxytocin which is called the Cuddle Hormone. Studies have found that couples who are in love with each other have higher amounts of oxytocin in their blood stream when they spend time together. Oxytocin also has healing powers. So, if you’re in love but going through some tough times, oxytocin could literally mend your broken heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-99.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Trust has to be the second most important thing when you form a relationship. Do you still trust him to love and hold you, through the good times and the bad times and to be by your side? Despite your differences, if you can trust your partner with your heart, emotions and feelings then this relationship is definitely worth working on. That kind of trust is hard to build and it doesn’t come by too easily.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-100.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;If you are thanking your lucky stars that you are finally ‘out of it’ then we all know there is no going back. But if the thought of leaving is tearing you up on the inside and leaving your partner isn’t your priority but you don’t know what else to do either, “… it means that there are some valid reasons to consider staying and fixing what isn’t working,” says Carolin Lehman from Huffington Post.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-101.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Are they trustworthy, kind and compassionate? Are they the kind of person you see yourself growing old with? When faced with problems, do they become your support and build you up instead of tearing you down? A good person is very hard to come by and if that’s the kind of partner you have then they will make you want to stay.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-102.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Categorizing your problems plays a vital role in your decision to stay in the relationship or not. If the problems are particular to the relationship and its dynamics as well as the personality of your SO then fixing it can prove tricky. But if the problems are particular to you and you want an out, then there is a chance the same problems will surface in a relationship with someone else as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-103.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Communication is a game changer. According to American Psychology Association, keeping concerns or problems bottled up can lead to resentment for your partner. According to a research,” …communication style is more important than commitment levels, personality traits or stressful life events in predicting whether happily married couples will go on to divorce.” An open and kind communication channel can potentially bring your relationship back from the brink, should you want to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-104.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;The romance can dull a bit when you are having disagreements and arguments but even if there is a tiny bit of chemistry left, it means it can turn into a roaring fire with some patience and effort. “If you have hit a lull, discuss it with your partner and talk about ways that you can infuse some excitement into your relationship,” suggests Lehmann in an interview with Leslie Petruk, a licensed councilor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-105.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;It takes two to do the tango. If your partner has already checked out of the relationship emotionally and physically and their bags are packed and ready to go by the door then give yourself some grieving time and move on. But if they are willing to work on it with you, give this relationship another chance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-106.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Does your partner make you want to be a better person or a different person? Do you feel like you need to change who you are and your core values at the cost of being in a relationship with them? Or do they inspire you to evolve and become a better and stronger version of yourself? These are vital questions to ask yourself before you decide if the relationship is worth saving or not.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;[Related: 5 Words And Phrases That Can Save Your Relationship]&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"How to Know If a Relationship Is Worth Saving","description":"#1.
