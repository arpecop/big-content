The way we sleep can often give us valuable insights into what we’re missing in the relationship of if we’re going in the right direction with our partner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course exceptions are always there but if your partner’s posture while sleeping changes suddenly, you might find these hints useful for decoding what’s going on in their head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;You’re into spooning&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-1-png.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-2-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Spooning indicates that your partner has your back. They’re behind you and have their arms over you in a protective position. It’s also a vulnerable position, both sexually and physically, so it hints that you feel perfectly secure in your relationship and that your partner is extremely protective of you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;You sleep few inches apart&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-3-png.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-4-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;This is usually a position in which new couples sleep. It’s mostly seen at the beginning of a relationship when the partners want maximum eye contact and are still in the process of finding out about the other person. They’re simply exploring their partner’s mind during this phase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Your partner cradles your head on his chest&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-5-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-6-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;This position indicates that your partner is protective of you. He’s conveying the message that he will use his power and keep you safe. If you look up to him and sleep in a fetal position, it shows that you’re depending on him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;You sleep facing each other&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-7-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-8-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;If you tend to sleep facing your partner, it’s usually an attempt at looking your partner in the eye. If they start facing you directly as well, it’s a sure sign that both of you feel distant from each other and need to connect more. Maybe it’s the intimacy you’re both craving, or just the usual comfort you’re both missing at the moment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;You sleep facing away from each other with your butts touching&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-9-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-10-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Couples who sleep back to back usually enjoy an intimate and comfortable relationship. Since both the partners are not facing each other but are still sure of their significant other’s presence, this shows a level of understanding that’s beyond the superficial needs of confirmation. There is an uncanny familiarity between the two where they don’t need to be entirely wrapped up with the other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;You sleep on your stomachs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-11-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-12-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Lying on your stomach keeps your front covered, which is usually the first part we would try to protect in the event of an attack. Sleeping on your stomach with your vulnerable parts covered means you’re anxious or vulnerable, or you’re feeling a lack of trust between you and your partner. If your partner sleeps on their stomach, maybe you can keep a hand over him to make him feel better.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;You sleep on opposite sides of the bed&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-13-png.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-14-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Whenever partners are sleeping with their backs towards each other, and far away, it shows the relationship isn’t going smooth. There’s some discomfort either because of some unresolved problems or issues in the relationship. Maybe it’s time both the spouses need to make some compromises if they want the relationship to keep going.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;You sleep with nothing touching but your feet or legs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-15-png.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-16-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;The feet or legs are farthest away from the brain, and they’re the first organs you usually use during a fight or flight response when you’re threatened. This shows that feet are the organs we usually resort to first, sometimes even without entirely conscious thought. If your partner is touching you with their feet, it surely means they’re looking for emotional or sexual attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sleeping Intertwined At First Then Moving Apart&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-17-png.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-18-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;If both of you are consciously going to sleep intertwined with each other, it shows that you both value the intimacy you share with each other. But if you’re moving away while sleeping, it means that subconsciously you value each other’s independence as well and are not shying away from giving your partner the space the need. This is one of the most ideal scenario in any relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;You sleep with your legs and arms intertwined&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-19-png.png&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-20-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;If you’re in the habit of sleeping with your partner with both your legs and arms around each other, it means you’re both too much into each other. This position shows you both act as a pair that completes each other. You are probably the couple that’s finishing each other’s sentences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;You sleep different distances from the headboard&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-21-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-22-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;People who tend to sleep near the headboard are usually more dominant of the two and those sleeping further away have low self esteem. Couples who sleep with their heads the same distance from the headboard are usually more in tune with each other and if their heads are touching it hints that they both know each other inside out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;One of you is a bed hog&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-23-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-5-10-2282-24-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com     &lt;p&gt;If one of the partner is in a habit of taking over the entire bed, leaving the other with little or no space, it’s a clear sign that they’re dominating more than just the blanket. They feel like they are the authority in the relationship and they call the shots. This is a clear sign that the relationship isn’t balanced, both emotionally and mentally and both need to sort things out before they go completely out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"This Is What Your Sleeping Position Says About Your Love Life","description":"While sleeping, our mind subconsciously controls the way we sleep with our partner."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/2/cf9e163ceec8c4764bd9be3978285532_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/2/d8b96f165c2b7576d3768628be9e92f2_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"What Does YOUR Palm Say About Your Relationships?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/2/c7b65f93b21bf6e5f02b47828564b6d2_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"16 Mysterious Photos (That Should NOT Exist)"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
