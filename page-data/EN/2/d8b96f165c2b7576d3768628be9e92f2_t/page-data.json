Palmistry still continues to fascinate people worldwide and whether it is for fun or to quench our curiosity wherever we see a palm reader, we will be sure to get a reading done. While many people are still skeptical of palmistry, there are studies which show that your palms can reveal a lot about your health, personality, future as well as sexuality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are simple ways and knowledge which you can use to read your own as well as your friends and family’s palms and hit the nail right on its head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;First things first:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you take a look at your palms you will see inter-connected lines on both palms. The length, depth, continuity and clarity of these lines along with the size, shape and texture of your hands and fingers can reveal a great deal about your personality, character and even spirituality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;1.Looking at the hands:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1296.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;If you have ever gotten a reading done, you will know that a palmist will first try to get a feel of your hands and palms turning them over and over. He is determining the shape of your hand and fingers as each distinct shape has its own distinguishing traits and characteristics. The four shapes include:&lt;/p&gt;  Earth: A broad palm and wide fingers. The length of the palm and fingers are the same. People with these type of hands:  &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1297.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos    Are practical and responsible May be materialistic Energetic and stubborn   Air: Long thin fingers with visible knuckles. The palms are smaller than the fingers.

In women, the right hand is what they are born with and the left hand tells their life story. The exact opposite is true for men, their left hand is what they are born with and the right hand is what they have achieved in their life. The dominant hand tells about the past and the present while the less dominant one tells about the future.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;3.Identifying the lines&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1302.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;There are many lines between our palms and among them the three major lines which are the most important in palmistry are:&lt;/p&gt;  The heart line (1) The head line (2) The life line (3)  &lt;p&gt;Deciphering these three lines goes as such:&lt;/p&gt;  The heart line: this line begins below the index or middle finger and extends all the way towards one’s pinky finger on the edge of the palm. It tells about a person’s emotional health and wellbeing.  Long: warm and loving but has unrealistic expectations of others Short: self-loving and an introverted personality Wavy: lack of commitment Straight: very practical and logical when it comes to matters of the heart Cleat and deep: generous and honest Faint: apathetic Broken: emotional turbulence   The head line: It starts just above the life line and sometimes will start at the same point. It branches out as it moves downwards into the palm away from the life line.  Long: intellectual with a good memory Short: logical Faint: more of a dreamer and spiritual rather than intellectual Deep: unbroken concentration towards life Forked: a person with multiple talents Absent: a casual approach towards life Wavy: a constant tussle between the head and heart     The life line: It originates between the thumb and the index fingers and goes down all the way to the edge of the palm towards the wrist. It is believed that the length of the life line means how long one is going to live but that is not true. This line reveals a person’s physical, mental and emotional growth through their life.  &lt;p&gt;o Long and deep: a well-balanced life and vitality&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;o Short and deep: overcoming life’s challenges&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;o Faint: an unadventurous life&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;o Deep: no much trouble in life&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;o Broken: indicates a break due to acute physical health, loss of some loved one or an accident.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;o Forked: a huge change in life&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"What Does YOUR Palm Say About Your Relationships?","description":"The secrets that lie between your palms."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/2/d8b96f165c2b7576d3768628be9e92f2_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/2/e032890449cc4c61764b9ea37761a342_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"19 Times People Had One Job and Failed Dramatically"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/2/cf9e163ceec8c4764bd9be3978285532_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"This Is What Your Sleeping Position Says About Your Love Life"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
