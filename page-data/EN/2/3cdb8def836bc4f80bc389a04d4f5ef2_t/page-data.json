After a very shaky start and lots of tears, he seems to have settled into school life. He&#39;s coming home and being impressively dramatic about all aspects of his life (&amp;quot;MUMMY YOU&#39;RE NOT MY BEST FRIEND ANYMORE DON&#39;T TALK TO ME EVER AGAIN I WON&#39;T EAT YOUR SPAGHETTI&amp;quot; etc) and today he brought home a pot of soil with a cardboard castle (on a straw) in it ‚Äì I&#39;m assured this will soon grow a beanstalk as big as the house. I&#39;m really proud of him. We&#39;re now manically throwing some gear together for a weekend away #welldonehenrybear #wineisinorder #notforyouthough #youcanhaveafruitshoot #halfterm&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  The Unmumsy Mum (@theunmumsymum) on Oct 21, 2016 at 8:00am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Achieving motherhood is one of the best feelings for the couple but especially the mother. The natural course of things has its trials and tribulations which the individual has to undergo in order to bring a new life into this world. It may seem insignificant or do not register at that level but she just ensured the progression of human race.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; ‚ù§Ô∏èBACK SOONüíö I am taking a little social media sabbatical for a few weeks so Wilf and I can get to know each other properly without the distraction of my phone (I‚Äôm a creature of habit and otherwise won‚Äôt be able to stop myself from replying to messages at stupid o‚Äôclock and browsing the Ibiza 2008 holiday snaps of people I‚Äôve never met). I‚Äôm temporarily deleting all the social media apps from my phone until I‚Äôm back online, so although my profile will remain here, I won‚Äôt even be lurking üëÄ which means that you won‚Äôt be able to get hold of me. I will be back soon though with an update on how it‚Äôs all going (Day 6 update: I said I hadn‚Äôt forgotten what the newborn bit was like but there is loads I‚Äôd forgotten, like being so tired you end up doing charades to act out what you‚Äôre trying to say and having a favourite boob for feeding ‚Äì always the left, I can only rugby ball the right). Thanks so much for all your lovely messages and comments and Happy Christmas from the newly extended Turner tribe. Much love to you all xx #seeyouin2018 #socialmediacoldturkey #lookingforwardtotheactualturkey #thanksWilfforcomingoutearly&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  The Unmumsy Mum (@theunmumsymum) on Dec 18, 2017 at 5:18am PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The adverts might make pregnancy look all too easy and may make it sound that only the delivery process is a little difficult. However the reality could not be far from the truth as the nine months or so a mother carries her child are not at all easy. To share the ups and downs of this bumpy ride one mum took to social media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mother of three boys, Sarah Turner from Exeter, Devon, England runs her own blog The Unmumsy Mum where she shares the glimpses of her motherhood to the world. Not just that she is also a celebrated author of books on motherhood.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; 30 weeks and feeling it! I‚Äôve included the second pic purely because I always see pics of pregnant women in tight tops and wonder how they haven‚Äôt piled on a few pounds anywhere else. I love this top and I don‚Äôt mind the extra side/back handles at all, which is actually amazing because with my first and second pregnancies I had real issues with what I perceived to be ‚Äòback fat‚Äô (I know, I know, what a silly billy but it did actually get me down at the time). Not this time, this is the last time I will do this and honestly I just want him to be OK in there. #30weeks #babybump #andextralumps&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  The Unmumsy Mum (@theunmumsymum) on Oct 11, 2017 at 1:42am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What actually appeals to the people is her incredibly honest take on the difficulties a mother may face. Not just the mother but the issues faced by family in general and her refreshingly open recollection of her own personal experiences really engaged her readership consisting of parents mostly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Infact her book The Unmumsy Mum was so popular that it quickly became &lt;em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt; number one bestseller. It actually is based on her blog and her readership admired the idea of putting all her thoughts in a compact manner in a book. With such a welcoming response, naturally she wrote her second book &lt;em&gt;The Unmumsy Mum Diary&lt;/em&gt; which is again her honest account of problems faced in raising children and other intimate details.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The average person can easily relate to her books and this is the reason why she has such a huge fan following. It is no surprise than that she has more than 500,000 facebook, 40,000 Twitter and 262,000 and counting instagram followers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What makes Sarah Turner keep on going is how people learn so much from her books and so many women find ways to deal with post natal depression. This really motivates the author to keep coming up with new work to help the mothers around the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-19-12-3527-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;@theunmumsymum/Twitter &lt;p&gt;The fact that she is no celebrity (although her books and blogs have kind of made her into one) is the reason why mothers could easily relate to her. For example becoming a bit heavier after child birth and not being able to regain your shapely selves is one such problem. To further hammer this point home she actually put on adult diapers on her postpartum body and this is one of the realities of post birth mothers.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; *New blog post* Sickness, Sex and Placentas: 20 Week Pregnancy Update ‚Ä¶ ‚¨ÜÔ∏èLink in bio. #pregnancyupdate #inflatablefanny #growingnotglowing #placentapraevia #babynumberthree&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  The Unmumsy Mum (@theunmumsymum) on Aug 13, 2017 at 9:18am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She brings humor to cheer up fellow mothers who are otherwise feeling the journey of pregnancy and birth to be boring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On asking her about any new work she would be coming up with soon was put to rest since she want to spend more of her time with her family for now. Even her twitter account said that she would be leaving the social media for a few days and will see all her followers in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Happiest of anniversaries to my husband and partner in parenting crimes. Here&#39;s us just now having a romantic date in the pool (with our kids and two of our nephews üò¨ü§£). Today marks seven years of marriage before which we&#39;d been &#39;going out&#39; for seven years. We first got chatting at our local nightclub when I was 16 (thanks to the blind eye of bouncers and/or my dodgy fake ID ‚Äì it made me about thirty-five even then ü§î). I think it was about a week before we were officially an item, &#39;cruising&#39; around town in his Citroen Saxo and mainlining giant tubs of pick &#39;n&#39; mix from Tesco (which he had to pay for &#39;cos I was still AT SCHOOL *coughs* cradle snatcher). Anyway, we&#39;re having to put the seven-year itch on hold while I&#39;m growing our third child üòâ #anniversary #happyholidays #iwasbasicallyachildbride #wehadtomakeourownfuninCornwall #turnersontour #wemakeboysonly&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by  The Unmumsy Mum (@theunmumsymum) on Aug 6, 2017 at 8:45am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Of course the family is always a top priority and with three children it kind of becomes a necessity. She still is managing to do a fabulous job of bringing smiles on the parents who might be too much flustered with pregnancy woes and the associated problems.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Mom Bares It All in Honest Post-Partum Pics, and the Internet Embraces Her Awesomeness","description":"Achieving motherhood is one of the best feelings for the couple but especially the mother.
