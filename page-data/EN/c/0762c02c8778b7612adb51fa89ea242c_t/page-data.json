The love we dream of as young kids. The heads over heel kind of love. The kind where every love song reminds you of them. You dream of forever together. Most girls want a guy who is kind, caring, strong yet sensitive. Who respects you? Most importantly, the one that is totally invested in the relationship. Not everybody gets their forever. Every romantic start can have a not so romantic ending. Here are 16 signs he’s losing interest:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;19. He just doesn’t care&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1477.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Whether it is date nights or homecooked meals, he doesn’t care about the effort you put in neither show appreciation for it. You have begun to feel that in a relationship for two, you’re the only one remaining.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;18. He gets angry on little things&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1478.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;It’s true some people are generally short tempered. However, almost everyone demonstrates patience in love. If he gets annoyed by the little things that he used to find cute once, it’s a dangerous sign. If he’s venting his frustrations on you, not giving you your space and unnecessarily being rude, it might mean that he isn’t that interested in the relationship anymore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;17. He doesn’t flirt anymore&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1479.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;In the beginning, the sparks are flying everywhere. Eventually, things slow down for most couples but they shouldn’t disappear. If it’s only been a while and he has stopped flirting with you, you should dig deeper to find out the problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;16. He is emotionally distancing himself&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1480.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Couples ideally rely on each other for emotional support and to fulfil their other emotional needs. You live with a person all day, every day. You begin sharing little details of your past, your present life and your aspirations about your future. You begin to open your wounds to them. You start being vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If he has gone from this kind of a relationship, to the point where he hardly talks about his feelings anymore, it might be that he is fulfilling his emotional needs somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. He doesn’t initiate intimacy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1481.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;No relationship is successful without the right kind of intimacy. Many couple therapists believe that physical attraction and intimacy is as important as emotional attachment. Hence, at no point should intimacy be the least priority. If you’ve noticed his lack of interest, it’s a red flag.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. He flirts with other women&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1482.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;When you’re in a dedicated relationship, you can dedicate your everything to them. This doesn’t mean that you can’t get attracted to another person but that for you, your relationship is sacred. You will remain committed and honour your relationship. If your man is often seen flirting with other women in social settings, things don’t look that bright for your relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. He isn’t honest&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1483.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Honesty is important. Whether it is in everyday life or a relationship. Without the foundation of trust and honestly, the relationship has no backbone. If you’re noticing that he isn’t upfront about himself in a relationship, doubts you continuously and assumes that you’re lying, it’s time you find out who the actual liar is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. He doesn’t trust you&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1484.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Without trust, both partners are going to feel like they are walking on egg shells. If you’re constantly being questioned on little things, it can make you feel exhausted. It’s also indicative of his lost trust and interest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. He doesn’t apologize for his mistakes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1485.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;You apologize in a relationship because you want it to remain intact and you’re genuinely sorry. Lately, he might have stopped apologizing or trying to make up after a fight. This shows two things. First, he just doesn’t care anymore. Second, maybe he wants you to realise that he doesn’t particularly enjoy the relationship he’s in.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;10. His plans don’t involve you anymore&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1486.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;He’s planning the same holiday but now with his other friends. He doesn’t bother initiating plans with you. If he’s making plans, they don’t involve you. This clearly shows lack of effort. Lack of effort indicates only one thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. He resents you&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1487.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Everybody makes mistakes occasionally. We should learn to let go. Forgive the other person if they are genuinely sorry. Now instead of forgiving and letting go, he resents your mistakes. Even after repeated apologizing, you’re still the bad guy. This might mean that he’s trying to cut you lose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. He might be cheating on you&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1488.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;In a relationship, the last thing you want is betrayal. It makes you feel inadequate and you start to question yourself. Remaining loyal is a lot of effort. If you’ve begun to feel there is someone else in his life apart from you, you might be right. The best and mature way to way to deal with it is to confront him. If one of you don’t want the relationship any longer, then you shouldn’t hold each other down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. You’re missing signs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1489.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Maybe he has tried approaching the subject before. Is he constantly saying things like maybe you are not meant to be. He’s constantly blaming you, resenting you. He doesn’t pay attention. He is giving you subtle signs. Maybe you should think over it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Future seems distant&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1490.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Planning for the future is important. Sure, nobody wants to feel overwhelmed thinking about the future from the start. For a while, if future is off the table, that’s ok. However, if he resists talking about the future like it doesn’t exist, it’s a red flag. Eventually, you’ll want to plan together. Maybe you want to study or want a job in another country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If a relationship is important to you, you should factor in your partner. If he doesn’t do that anymore, maybe he’s not that interested in the relationship as he used to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Your important days aren’t that important anymore&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1491.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;When you love someone, their important days become important for you. Their priorities become your priorities. Even the people they love become dear to you. Occasions like your birthday, your anniversary, were celebrated in the past, but aren’t anymore. No more elaborate plans or date nights on Valentines. These are little sign of a lost cause in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. You’re not a priority anymore&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1492.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;In a relationship, when you love the other person, everything can wait but them. Everything must include them and you take special care because they are your priority. You make time to treat them and love them. In a relationship, where one of the partners is not interested anymore, everything will come before you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There will always be an excuse to not be with you. To not spend time. Everything else but you, becomes a priority.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. They stop expressing love&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1493.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Occasionally, everybody wants validation. They want to hear ‘I love you’ and want you to make promises. They want to get physical love. If you’re beginning to feel that your partner doesn’t express love anymore. They don’t reassure you. You’re the only one initiating physical contact. Sit down and talk to them about your unfulfilled need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. He starts pushing you around&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1494.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Nobody likes being pushed around or being told what to do. He is constantly pushing you around, being rude unnecessarily. He is being dominating and you’ve begun to feel exhausted by this subtle form of emotional abuse. It’s time to call them out for their actions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. He will try to end things&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1495.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;If he has genuinely lost interest, he will try to end things. He will confront you and tell you that you both weren’t meant to be. It’s better to hear it out of their mouth and you should probably let go if he wants to leave.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;If you aren’t going to be happy in a relationship, there is no point in holding a person down. You deserve that special kind where you put give your hundred percent.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"19 Things Men Will Always Do When They Hate the Relationship They're In","description":"19 signs he is trying to end things.
