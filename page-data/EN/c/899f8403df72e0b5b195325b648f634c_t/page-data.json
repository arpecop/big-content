That essentially, is what time travel means. But let’s talk real life – is it true? Some scientists agree that it indeed is. All you need to do is travel at the speed of light in space, turn around and come back and you will be in the future. Too good to be true? Well here are some incredible coincidences which might change your mind!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Lawrence&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1954.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikimedia &lt;p&gt;If you think we’ve accidentally placed two pictures of the same person right above, you’re mistaken. The Hunger Games star we all know and love is known to have been born on August 15, 1990 to loving parents in Kentucky, but is that actually true? You see, the Egyptians had ‘Jennifer’ gracing the silver screen from back in the 1900s, because Zubaida Tharwat, who passed away only last year in 2016 is the exact spitting image of Jennifer! (Or should we say vice versa).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not only do the two look like identical twins despite neither of them having one, but they also have the same occupation and interests too. Did one of them travel backwards or forwards in time? Only time will tell! (Pun intended).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;President Lincoln and President Kennedy&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1955.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Pexels &lt;p&gt;There are just too many similarities in the lives of these two influential Presidents, so we’ll get right to it. Both of them were assassinated by gunfire on a Friday, prior to attending a celebration. Both of them suffered fatal wounds at the back of the head. President Lincoln’s death took place right before Easter and President Kennedy was killed right around Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both were accompanied by their wives as well as another couple. What’s more is that both Presidents had four children and a good friend named Billy Graham. President John F. Kennedy’s secretary was a woman named Ms. Lincoln whereas President Lincoln’s secretary was a man named Jon. Think this is all? Both their successors were Vice Presidents named Johnson who were both Southerners and Democrats!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Titan(ic)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1956.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Pexels &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to say there would be anyone who doesn’t know about the tragic sinking of the Titanic and the very many lives that were lost consequently, but this is after the incident occurred. Let’s go back, 14 years back, to 1898 when renowned English fantasy author Morgan Robertson had already penned down and published something eerily similar! In his book titled ‘Futility: The Wreck of the Titan’, Morgan’s description if compared to the actual Titanic sends chills down the spine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not only were both vessels claimed ‘Unsinkable’ the technical characteristics of both the Titan and the real Titanic were the same, so was the point of a shortage of lifeboats and even how the collision with the iceberg took place. Did Morgan travel in time to get this idea? Can’t say for sure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Hoover Dam&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1957.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Pexels &lt;p&gt;The Hoover Dam is situated on the border of American states of Nevada and Arizona. Described as a concrete-arch gravity dam, the reservoir is so gigantic that the sheer magnitude of water it stores has restructured the Earth’s crust underneath it, in turn causing many earthquakes in the area.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;What’s interesting though is the death, actually two, out of the hundreds of workers who lost their lives during construction. George Tierney was one of the first people to lose their lives while carrying out preparatory work, back in 1922. Fast forward the dam nearing completion when standard operating procedures were safer, the last death took place. This was a man named Patrick Tierney. Sounds familiar? That’s because the two were father and son – and oh. Both of them died on December 20.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neighboring travelers?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1958.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Pexels &lt;p&gt;“Excuse me while I kiss the sky!”. Jimi Hendrix is known as one of the best and most influential electric guitarists of all time. With his bandana and drug scandals to his flashy wardrobe, Jimi shaped rock and roll as we know it and his contributions can never go unnoticed. Speaking of unnoticed, Jimi’s neighbor was George Handel – a classical composer who occupied 25 Brook Street.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With command over composition, George Handel is a legend in his own right. Jimi on the other hand, who occupied 23 Brook Street is also a musical genius as we’ve just discussed but there is one small problem. While Mr. Hendrix rocked us in the late 1960s, George Handel is titled one of the best musicians of the Baroque era. That’s 1600 to 1750 BC. Was there any time traveling?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;James Dean’s cursed Porsche&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1959.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Pexels &lt;p&gt;Hollywood heartthrob James Dean had a fond love for his Porsche sports car, in which he tragically passed away in September 1955. After the crash, however, the car turned super unlucky, perhaps due to missing its owner so much! Having been towed away from the crash site, the car was taken to a garage for potential repairs but the foundation gave way and the engine slipped onto a mechanic, who shattered both his legs – ouch! The car’s parts were then figured to be giving a fitting farewell by being sold separately but a doctor who swapped his sports car’s engine for the Porsche died in a crash while racing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The man who used the car’s driveshaft was also killed in an accident. When the body of the car was restored, the garage it was housed in was destroyed in a fire and the car fell on a teenager when displayed in Sacramento, who broke his hip. Think that’s it? Well, the car was mounted on a trailer in Oregon once and the trailer’s tow bar got loose and smashed into a shop window once. Lastly, the car mysteriously fell apart into 11 pieces while on steel supports in 1959. Reasons all unknown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edgar Allen Poe&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1961.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Pexels &lt;p&gt;Born in January 1809, English Author Edgar Allen Poe is one of the finest writers, poets and literary critics of all times. His finest work being mystery and macabre, Poe’s work has raised many an eyebrow over the years. One such example is his book titled ‘The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket’, he describes the very adventurous survival of 4 sailors stranded at sea who brave a storm and are forced to eat their ship boy named Richard Parker. Albeit Poe claimed that this was based on real-life events, there was no such event to have taken place – at least not until 46 years later! A ship did indeed sink and the four crew members who survived did admit to being forced to eating their ship boy. His name? Richard Parker.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brothers from Bermuda&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1963.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Pexels     &lt;p&gt;In July of 1975, a 17 year old boy named Erskine Lawrence Ebbin rode into town on his moped. An inhabitant of the Bermuda islands, he was sadly run over by a taxi driver and was killed on the spot. While you may be wondering what’s so unbelievable about an occurrence that tragic as it is, happens daily all over the world, here’s adding to it. Erskine’s elder brother was also killed on the same day last year while riding the same moped. He was also 17 at the time, but that’s not all. The taxi driver, taxi and even passenger were all the same. Do you have any explanation for this except time travel? So, ladies and gentlemen, here were some weird coincidences which are unbelievable yet true. Which is your favorite? Think we missed out on any? Let us know!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"13 Unbelievable Coincidences That Will Leave You Confused","description":"Do you believe in time travel?
