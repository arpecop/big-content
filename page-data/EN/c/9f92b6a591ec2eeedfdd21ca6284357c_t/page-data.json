Dogs are loyal, faithful, adorable, friendly and clever at the same time. There are hundreds and thousands of species present in this world. This article considers some dogs that are endangered and may get extinct in some years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. The English Foxhounds:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1564.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, the English foxhounds were formally used for hunting foxes. This specie was first recognized and registered by American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1909. In 1995, only 35 foxhounds were registered with AKC. Due to their faithfulness and gentleness, foxhounds are now majorly considered for household purposes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being small in size (55-75 pounds), they are usually cute and people fall for their cuteness. British hunters refrain from using them after 7 years of age, just because they think that the foxhounds’ hunting skills get weakened after they attain this age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. The Harrier:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1565.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Just after the one year of its foundation, AKC registered harriers in 1885. These dogs were used in England for hunting rabbits and hares; this practice eventually gave them the name that they have. The harriers resemble foxhounds, many people get confused and mix up both the breeds. Their friendly behavior, outgoing attitude and clownish habits is what makes them popular among the dog lovers. People still ponder over why such loving and friendly breed got rare. Well the answer to this question is that when English government illegalized the hare hunting, the demand for this breed fell, and people stopped breeding them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. The Norwegian Lundehund:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1566.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The Norwegian Lundehund means “puffin dogs”. The were bred and kept for hunting puffins on the steep hills and cliffs. Like any other kind of dogs, they are smart and energetic; but the contradiction lies in their paws, they have 6 toes in a single claw. It is said that a Lundehund can catch 30 puffins per day. The reason behind this is that their head and neck both are quite flexible (they can even touch their spine with their mouth). This flexibility make it easier for them to search and grab puffins out from the caves. The cause behind their rarity is that hunters started using nets to catch puffins in 1900s, which made the demand for these dogs to decline as a result.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. The American Foxhounds:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1567.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Do not mix it up. The American and English foxhounds are not the same thing. The American cousins are leaner than the English counterparts. They were specially bred in the American territory, by crossing the English and French foxhounds. The intentions behind the crossing was to make them more suitable for hunting and other games. Even George Washington kept this specie with him when he was alive. With the passage of time, demand for foxhunting declined. This was the main reason behind the decrease in the numbers of American foxhounds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Otterhound:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1568.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The bulky Otterhounds belong to the English land as well. Their length is longer than their height, which makes them unique among the dog community. Apart from making it unique, this body shape enables it to walk slowly for long distances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The putter body coat is quite rough, while the inner coat is oily; this protects it from both brambles and cold water altogether. Coming to their name and function, they were used for hunting otters and can smell otter anywhere, even in the running water. The Otterhounds think of nothing but hunting otters, when they go for hunting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the opposite side, its temperament is very much cordial and affectionate making them one of the best pets. Otter hunting was at its peak after the World War 1, however the English government (in 1978) banned otter hunting because the otter population declined heavily due to water pollution. Soon after this, Scotland did the same thing. This triggered the hunters to sell the dog to private owners, who used them for household purposes. Today approximately 800 otterhounds exist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Swedish Vallhund:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1569.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;This type is of great value when it comes to tracking and herding. They are quick, obedient and athletic. Their colors vary immensely with fair variance in tail shape from slightly bowed to fully curved. Vallhunds have quite a history, going back a thousand years back in the times of Vikings, hence nicknamed “Viking dogs”.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;During the world war era, their population declined considerably. In 1942, the government put forward a breeding program to save the specie. In the next year, 1943, a Swedish kennel club officially registered the breed. The next year, standard for Vallhund was updated and they were named väst-götas-pets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Bedlington Terriers:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1570.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Often misunderstood as a lamb because of its curly and wooly outer skin, the Bedlington terriers are surprisingly more athletic than other breeds. They were originally bred for racing and other sports. This type belongs to North Britain, which is home to many other species as well. The first Bedlington terrier was Ainsley’s Piper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The miners really appreciated the breed back in times, for its preying skills, hunting rats and badgers. Many artist used them for their paintings in 18th and 19th centuries. The National Bedlington Terrier Club was founded in 1877.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. The Finnish Spitz:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1571.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Finnish Spitz resemble fox in their appearance. They have erect ears, dense skin and a bushy tail. The color of their coat varies between pale honey and deep auburn. Their history goes five thousand years back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their form depends upon the environment they went through and the need of people who tamed them. Spitz are Finland’s national dogs without any doubt. They were formally used for hunting games like bird and squirrel hunting, and even the larger animals like elks and bears. In the 18th century, Finnish people cross bred them with other species and making the original form rare and hard to find.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The government tried to revive the specie, hence recognized it in 1892 with the help of Finnish Kennel Club.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Catahoula Leopard Dogs:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1572.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Originally originated in the Louisiana (USA), these dogs are multi colored with textures on its skin. Their name comes from the Catahoula parish in Louisiana, where these dogs were first bred and spread. People used to keep them in their house, in order to avoid the hogs from overrunning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many theories regarding the origin of these dogs. The most relevant one is that people used to cross breed their dogs with the dogs of Native Americans, giving rise to this specie. The most commonly discussed feature is the webbing in their paws, which go deeper in their toes than usual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Webbed paws help them jog through soggy and damp places in Louisiana. They were named state dogs for Louisiana in 1979 and were recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1995. They are rare but excellent sledding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Mudi:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1573.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Closely related to the Puli, the Mudi is Hungarian herding dog. It has long corded coat on its body. The coat is curly and thick, but not as much as the Pulis. People used to get confused in both the breeds. In 1930s, the first distinction was made when shepherding was replaced by farming.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite being rare, they are quite popular in herding due to their instincts and intelligence. This highly energetic and athletic breed’s origin is not known because it was registered in 1930s. They were formally known as “driver dogs” in Hungary. Many of these dogs were killed in the world war era, making them rare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Azawakh:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1574.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The Azawakhs originated from the Azawakh valley in the Sahara dessert. The native people living there used them for hunting gazelles and other animals. They add high values to guarding houses and are quite friendly and faithful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The athletic character comes from the slender body shape, which allows them to burst through the air and change direction when needed. They are sighthound which means that they hunt using their eyes. They love to chase anything that moves in front of them, but they are quite shy in front of people that they do not know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The specie is not common outside the Sahara region. They are not so popular outside Sahara because they are adapted to hot and dry weather, making them vulnerable in cold conditions; and chasing things can cause problems as well. The breed came to USA in 1980s, the United Kennel Club recognized it in 1993. The Azawakh were not recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) but forms their stock in 1997.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. The Thai Ridgeback:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1575.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The ridgebacks first can to USA in 1994. Only few thousands of them exist outside Thailand and a hundred in USA. They were used originally for hunting and guarding. The ridgebacks are quite loyal as well, making them valuable in many aspects. They are given this name because of the fur that grows on their back in opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;They are quite unpopular outside Thailand, because of there ferociously territorial nature. They do not go well in the cold climate, are quite intimidating and have issues with other dogs living with them. Some say that they descended from the Hottentots. Many say that they go back 350 year in the history, but people believe that the time period may be longer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"12 of The World's RAREST Dog Breeds Ever!","description":"Do you have interest in dogs?
