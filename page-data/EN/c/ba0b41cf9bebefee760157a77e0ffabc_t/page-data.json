The powers which leave us in bewilderment as to how strange things happen which challenge our existence. This ends up showing us that it is possible that our lives could just end up in minutes before we are able to even know. So the following list is a compilation of certain events which were caught on the camera during the disaster and how it impacted the situation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Cars and ships toppling over&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1086.jpeg&quot;/&gt;youtube &lt;p&gt;Whoa! This is quite a scene near the port. You can see the high tide of the water which makes the ships starting topple over and next we are seeing the cars getting rolled over just to become dust in the water. It is really looking like there is no power to stop the tide and the cars are just looking like mini toys which could be toppled like at the roll of a finger. The disaster further continues as it moves towards the housing set-ups and you can see things floating like literally swimming! The force of the water is destroying everything along its way. I particularly felt afraid after watching this one and it made me really wonder about the way our life can end!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Ferocious water side hitting the rocks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1087.jpeg&quot;/&gt;youtube &lt;p&gt;The see seems pretty calm and quiet. Waves are building up resulting in a tide. As we can see the tide is building up and then suddenly it hits the mountainous rocks and the water starts to gush from every side. Afterwards it gets wilder in every literal sense of the word “wild”!&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;4. Storm&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1088.jpeg&quot;/&gt;youtube &lt;p&gt;Seems like a blizzard to me! Slowly making it way it the takes over the entire sky along with the wind blowing which is making the trees flutter. You might also see some flashes of lightning making the entire scene scary. The sky seems to disappear and the storm seems to take over the whole of the sky. Birds are also trying to flee towards home thinking that it is night time. There is a bit of lightning too and the tress are also blowing towards a certain direction. Storm seems like a whirlwind slowly rising up and making its way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Lightning&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1089.jpeg&quot;/&gt;youtube &lt;p&gt;Man that is one really scary flash of lightning. Since it can be seen and heard quite closely it made me felt like I am actually experiencing it right here. The darkness and the way the light flashes makes one really stupefied. One heavy flash of light it is indeed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Angry snowdrops&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1090.jpeg&quot;/&gt;youtube &lt;p&gt;Initially it seemed like there are raindrops which are hitting the ground in a very ferocious way like gun shots. When I actually tried to look at it closely I got the feeling that these were not rain drops rather they are snowdrops! These drops cover the ground and then also mix in to the water stream. What a lovely view it is to wake up to! The snow drops are looking quite angry as they are flowing in a really flashy way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We all love the sight of the snowfall don’t we?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Sky getting darker&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1091.jpeg&quot;/&gt;youtube     &lt;p&gt;Can you see the sky getting dark? Slowly and gradually it is getting really dark and the trees are also titled towards one side due to the heavy wind blowing. Although the roads seem clear but I believe the dust storm is getting the better of it. The view has started to get hazy and soon the view is completely blocked due to the storm.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"6 Scary Moments Ever Natural Disasters Caught on Camera","description":"It is strange how sometimes Mother Nature tends to show us its powers.
