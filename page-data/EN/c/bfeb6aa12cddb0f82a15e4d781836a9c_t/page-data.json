Too many people feel that they are obliged to be committed in some+ way in order to be accepted by society. The false portrayal of relationships in social media often serves to further this feeling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, romantic connections are not something one should jump into very quickly. The mainstay of such bonds should be support, love, and respect. If these are not present, negative qualities like manipulation and abuse take over. Below are some signs of manipulation we shouldn’t ignore:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-711.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;If you’re with a manipulator, chances are you’re always feeling extremely guilty. No matter what you do, they would find a way to turn every little problem and frustration back onto you. You may find yourself sharing something with them only to hear them whine about how tired they are. They may even accuse you of thinking only about yourself and not their tiredness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If such a case seems all too familiar, your relationship is potentially a manipulative one. Spotting the problem is the first step. The next time you are accused of something you didn’t do, don’t freak out. You’re probably not at fault. Remind your partner that a relationship is all about give and take. If you have to listen to their problems, they should have the patience to listen to yours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-712.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Of course, when you are the guilty one, they are the victimized. Manipulators often simply want to be the center of attention and pity. You can sniff out this problem if they always have a load of problems ready to dump on you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the problem-sharing is within a limit, they’re probably just looking for help and not manipulating. However, if they are constantly dragging you down with their negativity, they may need professional help. Before you end up requiring some yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another way to detect a self-made victim is when they always ask for a favor after their problem-unloading. If they had a hard day at work, you may be asked to do the housework for the day. Then the week, and the month. Finally, you may find yourself taking over all the housework along with your own demanding work schedule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-713.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;The really unfortunate thing about being with a manipulator is that they know you so well. You’ve shared many intimate details about yourself with them. Hence, your insecurities, fears, and sensitive areas are like ammunition to them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Manipulators often throw all logic out of the window and try to provoke their victims in some way. They may try to hurt you with taunts and senseless accusations. This would usually get a rise out of you so that they can act hurt and tragic when you do confront them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-714.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Manipulators often try to get their partners to make hasty decisions. This leaves the other person less thinking time and usually leads them to the decision the manipulator wants. They may make a big deal out of wanting a quick answer, maybe even within a minute or so. And God forbid if you ever want to change your decision after some thought. You’d be accused of evil intentions for the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you find yourself pushed into a decision in this manner, remember that you have your rights. The world wouldn’t end if you ask for a few days before committing to a plan for next year. You also have all the right in the world to change your mind if you’re not comfortable with any previous decision.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;5.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-715.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Manipulators are experts at spilling their guts on every occasion. They never seem to be too busy to spend hours wailing about how they don’t get time to nap. On the other hand, when it comes to your own problems, the manipulator is mysteriously as busy as a bee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you find your significant other always too busy to listen to your problems, you have a red flag. They may also lend an ear for some time, but the conversation gets skillfully turned to themselves. Their problems are always much bigger and more important than anyone else’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there isn’t any real way to deal with such a problem. Experts and common sense, however, advise us to get out of that relationship before it consumes the victim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-716.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Getting out of a relationship with a manipulator, however, is easier said than done. Manipulators hate to be left to their own devices and have no one to feed off on a daily basis. They would hence emotionally blackmail any partner who expresses a desire to break up. This might even come into place if their partner simply suggests spending some time apart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most disturbing threats are those of self-harm or even suicide threats. The victim hence feels a responsibility to stay, fearing that their partner would take their own life. However, such threats are usually empty. If you are faced with this, remind them that only they are responsible for what they do. If you still feel worried, suggest a good psychiatrist and get out while you still can.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-717.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Another unethical and immoral manipulative technique is among one doubt their own memories. You may clearly remember the manipulator calling you all kinds of names and insults. Some time down the road, however, they may claim they didn’t say anything too bad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twisting and tweaking the past like this is called gaslighting. It serves to confuse the victim and make the manipulator complacent even though they’re the ones at fault. Manipulators would lie so smoothly and confidently that their partner starts doubting their own sanity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In such cases, it is best to trust your own memory rather than that of a manipulator. You remember the hurt you felt, and you’re the only one who gets to measure your own worth. Reiterate what you remember and don’t back down. However, avoid an out-and-out fight. It’s miles better to simply make a graceful exit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-718.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;The thing about manipulators is that they wouldn’t let go of the past. They may say they’ve forgiven you for some imagined wrong. However, they would be sure to bring up that wrong each time you do something they don’t like. You may also be reminded of their forgiveness and expect to be supremely grateful for it at all times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may feel bewildered and confused by the immaturity of these repeated stories and arguments. However, it may help you to remember just what you were talking about at the moment. You can then try to bring them back to the point at hand instead of going on and on about something irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-719.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Do not assume that manipulators are above tricks just because you are. They may use some immensely childish technique to get what they want. For instance, they could ask you for a huge favor, such as splurging on an expensive cruise for the two of you. This way, even if you refuse, they could ask for something cheaper than a cruise, like some jewelry. Of course, the jewelry would be their real goal all along.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In times like these, learn to separate the two requests. Focus on what you can actually afford to gift them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Think rationally without comparisons. This may lead them to compromise or become more reasonable, if you’re lucky. However, we recommend not holding your breath for a magical change.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;It may be hard to admit that we’re the victim of manipulation, especially through a loved one. Unfortunately, it happens more often than many may think. If you notice any of the above signs in your relationship, try discussing them with your partner. If all efforts fail, think about cutting your losses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"9 Telltale Signs Your Partner Is Manipulating You","description":"Manipulation often happens in unequal relationships.
