But we are sure you are dreaming of a summery evening when you can chill on the beach with a margarita in your hand and soaking in that vital Vitamin D. But before you can hit the sandy shores, you have to have a beach body that makes everyone envious. And winter season is a perfect time to work on that while you are staying inside enjoying the warmth of your home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below we have detailed an exercise for almost every major part of your body so you can tone yourself from top to bottom, and the good thing is, they are all fairly easy to do. So even if you are not an exercise junkie, you can easily master these moves (or holds!).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-368.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;This is the area which is usually neglected. We tend to focus on our tummy or thighs and give little to no thought about exercises for the neck. Although, we should. It is the neck that bears the burden when we sit and work for long periods of time as it supports our head. According to Self, the following exercises work two ways: It can strengthen neck muscles and if you have existing neck pain, it can help to relieve it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seated Neck Release:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This gentle stretch targets the sides of your neck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sit on the floor in a cross-legged position or in a chair with your feet flat on the ground. Extend your right arm next to your right knee or along the right side of the chair. Place your left hand on the top of your head and slowly tilt your head to the left. Apply gentle pressure with your hand to increase the stretch. To feel a deeper stretch, you can hold onto your right knee or the seat of the chair. This stabilizes the torso and allows you to isolate the stretch on the side of your neck. Hold on this side for 30 seconds, then slowly lift your head up and repeat this stretch on the other side.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Behind the Back Neck Stretch:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This standing stretch can be done anywhere, and will offer a deep stretch in the sides of your neck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stand with your feet hip distance apart, arms by your sides. Reach both hands behind your backside, and hold onto your left wrist with your right hand. Use your right hand to gently straighten your left arm and pull it away from you slightly. To increase the stretch in your neck, slowly lower your right ear toward your shoulder. Stay here for 30 seconds and then switch sides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-369.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Just as we should develop a habit of exercising our neck, so should we give attention to our shoulders. Ever felt good after a good shoulder massage? That’s because the tension in the shoulder muscles is released after they are massaged and they relax. To keep your shoulders strong yet beautiful, try out these exercises charted out by LaRue E. Cook, who is a fitness expert and an exercise junkie. These would tone the muscles of your shoulders and using a light weight, of about two to five pounds, is recommended.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Empty The Can:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stand with your feet about hip-width apart, with relaxed knees (your “relaxed stance”). Hold a single dumbbell in your hand. Place your thumb-side against your thigh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lift your arm up and out at about a 45-degree angle from your body, pointing your thumb-side down toward the ground as you lift. Think of pouring out a can of soda. Keep your wrist firm (don’t bend it as you exercise).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lift up to shoulder height, pause for a second or two, and then return to the starting position.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Draw the Sword:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have ever wanted to feel like a character in Game of Thrones fighting for their honor, then this exercise is definitely for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Start in your “relaxed stance” as mentioned earlier. Place a light dumbbell in one hand and place that hand, palm down, on the opposite thigh (for example, put the thumb of your right hand on your left thigh). Keep your arm straight throughout this exercise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Draw your arm across your body (out and up to above your opposite shoulder). Once your hand has reached a level above your shoulder, return to your starting position.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perform this exercise slowly. Complete 12 repetitions, and make sure you switch arms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-370.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Now we come to an area which gives most of us trouble. Either our arms are too flabby, or if they are slim, they are not toned enough. Here are two exercises from Cosmopolitan which would ensure that you have toned, beautiful arms you can be proud of:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Field Goal Post&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bring your elbows up to just below shoulder height with one dumbbell in each hand. Open up your arms into a field goal position, stretching them back to activate your shoulder blades. From there, drop your forearms down so that they are parallel to the ground before lifting them back up into field goal position and closing them in front of your face. Repeat 10 times while keeping your elbows up and your core engaged.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Overhead Triceps Extension&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Put your arms up above your head with a dumbbell in each hand. Drop your hands down behind your head and slowly lift them back up. This move is a double whammy on your triceps so you will feel the burn. Keep your elbows close to your ears when repeating the motion, and, again, keep your core taut as you do this movie. Do 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-371.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Women who exercise regularly do see a marked change in the appearance of their breasts. They appear firmer and perkier and sag less with age. If you also want these benefits, try the exercises detailed below:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Push-up&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lie on your stomach, place hands flat on the ground next to your arm pits and push yourself up so your elbows are slightly bent. Now bend legs at the knees. Bring your feet up and cross at the ankle. Make sure you keep your stomach tensed, slowly lower your chest to the ground in three or four counts, then push yourself back up again. Repeat as many times as you can.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Women’s Health explains, a push up is a great compound exercise and can be done anywhere. All the more reason to try it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bench press&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lie with the middle of your back on top of a stability ball and make sure your shoulder blades have room to move. Your knees should be bent at a 90-degree angle. Hold dumbbells next to your arm pits with knuckles facing forward. Count to three as you push the weights up away from your chest, until your arms are almost straight above you. Slowly lower back to starting position using the same number of counts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-372.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;A thin waist is a dream for most women. Add to that the fact that it is considered the ultimate sign of a beautiful figure, and the pressure just piles up to attain one. However, with these easy-to-do exercises detailed by the Fitness Magazine, you can make your dream into a reality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Side Plank-Up:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lie on left side on floor with legs stacked and a rolled-up towel between thighs, propping torso on left elbow so that left forearm is perpendicular to torso. Make it easier: Stagger feet so that side of right foot is on floor in front of left foot for a wider base of support.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lift hips so that body forms a straight line from head to toe and squeeze towel between thighs. Hold for 1 count, then lower.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do 10 reps. Switch sides and repeat. Do 3 sets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fly Up:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sit on a folded towel on floor, lean back to rest on elbows and place feet together on a wall in front of you so that knees are bent about 90 degrees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Extend legs up, keeping feet against wall, then press rounded lower back into floor and squeeze abs as you lift arms to reach toward feet, elbows soft. Make it harder: Press feet into wall as you reach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do 20 pulses: Curl torso up 1 inch, then lower 1 inch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do 3 sets, hugging knees to chest to rest between sets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-373.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Ahh, another problem area! Whatever you do, or how much you stay on your toes all day, the fat from the thighs seems to be the most stubborn thing around. It just refuses to go away. But we are sure that the exercises charted out by Jessica Smith below, would definitely help you to slim down and tone your thighs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Runner’s Lunge to Balance:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Start standing with your feet together. Take a big step forward with your right leg. Reaching towards your right foot with both hands and hinging slightly forward from your hips, bend both knees into a low lunge (be sure to keep your right knee lined up over your right ankle at the bottom of your lunge. Don’t let your knee extend past your toes). Your left knee should be pointed straight down to the floor (like a sprinter about to start running).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next, press your weight into your right leg and push down through your right foot as you stand up out of the lunge, lifting your left leg off the floor and straight up behind your hip. Your upper body should maintain the hinged forward position as you stand, with your back straight, abs tight [B]. Balance for one count and then lower back down into the lunge. If it’s too hard to stand on one leg, try tapping your left foot lightly on the floor behind you as you stand up out of the lunge. Repeat 15 times and then switch to the other side.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scissor Power Switch:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Start standing with your right foot forward, left leg back and lower into a runner’s lunge, reaching your left arm towards your right foot and extending your right arm behind you. Push off the floor with both feet, jumping straight up, scissoring legs midair, and land back into a runner’s lunge with your left leg forward, right arm reaching across.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If an injury prevents you from jumping, try quickly alternating your legs with a rear tap instead of the jump. Do 15 switches (or alternating rear taps) total.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;So try these exercises and we are sure that when summertime rolls around, you would be the envy of all on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"You Need These Exercises to Look Gorgeous When Naked","description":"Exercises to tone almost every part of your body"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/c/1dcee3dce0889966e85ce6d481c64cec_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/c/22c4ce08563b73c264fee91f0ec8558c_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Your Meanest Friends Are Probably the Ones Worth Keeping Researchers Say"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/c/1c8e79343c37998994fe774ba2af42ac_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"This Shark from Prehistoric Times Is Back to Freak Us All Out"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
