The frilled shark is a nasty creature with a total of three hindered teeth and is also not new to planet earth. Remains of the frilled shark have been discovered dating back tens of millions of year to the time when dinosaurs walked the earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact according to the good people at the British Broadcasting Corporation the scary shark has been around for at least 80 million years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shark is about 5 feet in length and has a head that is snakelike in appearance while its body looks like that of an eel. The fish has named due to its teeth however which are frilly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The teeth are arranged in such a manner as to allow the shark to trap its hapless prey. This creature from the seas preys on different creatures for starters it preys on other sharks. In addition to sharks it also preys on squid and fish. The fact that it has a very long jaw allows the shark to swallow its prey in one go.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1385.jpeg&quot;/&gt;science-rumors &lt;p&gt;This shark was found off the Algarve coast off the southern coast of Portugal, at an astonishing depth of some 2,300 feet. The creature was found by accident and was discovered by researchers who were working on a project for the European Union that was aimed at trying to cut back on unwanted catches during commercial fishing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shark lives at such deep depths that it is rarely ever recorded on camera much less captured while still alive. The fish has been found in places far and wide ranging from the seas of western Europe, to the Indian ocean all the way to Japan and even as far away as Australia and New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It has been found at depths of close to one mile below sea level. One such shark was found 5150 feet below the sea. However it does not usually go below roughly 3900 feet. The fish also takes its time coming into the world and unlike humans who have gestation period of an agonizing nine months, this shark has gestation period of about three and a half years. It is known have to the longest gestation period of any vertebrae. One thing they do have in common with humans however is the fact that they can mate all year round and unlike many other creatures on both land and seas, they are not bound by any mating season as such.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fish was discovered by a German man Ludwig Doderlein, who happened to come across the creature while on a trip to the Far East. However, his studies on the fish have been lost to history and the oldest scientific study we have of this scary shark is from the 1880s when they were studied by the American Samuel Garman&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though it is widely distributed geographically the shark does not have a huge population and it is thinly distributed across a very wide area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This particular catch is thus of great importance for scientific study. Back in 1883 the fish was studied by one Samuel Garman, who thought that the shape of the frillâ€™s head was what had inspired various myths about the existence of sea serpents.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Pollution and over fishing have led to growing problems for all forms of amphibious life and although its impact on this particular shark is not very well known due to its rarity, one thing which would be safe to assume is that the shark is also suffering like all other creatures on the planet due to the actions of humans.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"This Shark from Prehistoric Times Is Back to Freak Us All Out","description":"They have found a really weird shark off the coast of Portugal.
