No matter how hard we try, we always end up buying stuff we never wanted to buy in the first place. This is a lack of willpower on our part, but there are several other factors. To be sure, companies, retailers, and supermarkets sure leave no stone unturned in weaseling money out of us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hence, we’ve drawn out a little list for you. Here, we would detail just how you’re being tricked out of your money in several places. You may not pay a certain price at one place but would happily do so at another. Read on below to find out these 19 sneaky tricks!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;19. Mind the Gap&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1970.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Look at the prices for different popcorn/drink sizes when you next go to the movies or any fast food chain. The small and the medium would be priced at a much higher gap than the medium and large. The difference goes up to two dollars and more. For instance, you could get the small for $1, the medium for $5, and the large for $6.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This clever tactic makes you think that buying the large is the most economical way. You may think of sharing it, but you’re really just paying more for less. Many places don’t even fill their large fries, popcorn or drinks much more than the other sizes. Hence, you are actually going for the most expensive choice available.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;18. No Currency Sign&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1971.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Not having a dollar or pound sign is a usual practice, especially when you’re in any kind of restaurant. However, this is a very deliberate mechanism. When one sees any reminder of actual currency, they see the number as an actual payment. With the sign dropped, the brain doesn’t really process the eventual cost of the meal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, research at Cornell University has proven that people spend around eight percent more when they don’t see the dollar sign. We are sure that supermarkets would use this same trick if they weren’t afraid of getting paid in a less valuable currency!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;17. A Small World&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1972.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Conventional stores and supermarkets are highly threatened by the increasing trend of online shopping. It is hence no surprise that they would rush to adopt every trick in the book to maintain their profits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet another sneaky practice is that of installing small floor tiles. When four thousand shoppers were studied for their habits, it was found that the small tiles caused them to walk slower. This allowed for more time in the store, more browsing, and usually more purchases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the tiles were widened or even lengthened, shoppers tended to speed up. They thus got their shopping done more quickly and effectively. That is good for them, but not good for the stores! So smaller tiles are now in great use within physical shopping locations. If not the whole store, then the aisles with the most expensive items certainly have more intricate designs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;16. One Red Cent&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1973.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;There’s probably no shopper who is unaware of this frustrating pricing strategy. Pricing an item as $2.99 is only making it one cent shy of $3. However, research has shown that our brains usually register only the left number. Hence, we see this price as close to two dollars than three. Our decisions follow accordingly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This practice is especially true in countries where the language is written from left to right. English-speaking customers are thus more likely to fall for such tactics. However, there is a difference between the kinds of products that sell with such a strategy. This would be discussed in the next point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. Between Want and Need&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1974.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The numbers game is not just the practice of unrounded numbers. A study in the Journal of Consumer Research says that when we buy luxuries, round numbers are more of a trigger. When we buy something we need, such as bread or eggs, we tend to get swayed by irregular pricing. A cent lower here and there seem to make a huge difference when it really doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is quite a recent finding, but a very interesting one. Make sure to keep an eye out for this difference when you’re out shopping next time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. Matching Numbers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1975.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The game continues with matching the number of items with their total price. Normally, we wouldn’t dream of buying five jars of cream at once. However, if a sign says that we can get five jars for five dollars, our aesthetic sense perks up. We would be extremely tempted to put one or even two five-packs into our cart at once. Even if we don’t use the cream, we’d give it away as cheap gifts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, if you look closely, you may find that the original price for one jar is only a dollar, or even lower! You could hence have bought only what you needed for the same individual price! Buying in bulk does not always equal buying for wholesale prices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. The Rudeness Factor&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1976.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;This is quite a strange trick, but one that would explain a lot. We usually think salespeople get surly because they hate their job. However, the reason may not be their mood, but their training. Many studies from business schools show that when customers go into a luxurious place, they feel a bit overwhelmed. The staff there plays on that feeling of smallness by being overly snobbish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order to compensate for the low feeling, customers then end up buying more. At fancy restaurants, they may even order without looking at the price. They may not realize it, but they are getting intimidated by the polished waiter or staff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Assumed Shortage&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1977.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;You must have seen many signs that contain the words “while supplies last”. Alternatively, supermarkets may have a limit on how much one customer can buy. This creates a perceived shortage in the buyers’ minds. They may only need a gallon of milk, but end up buying five because that’s their maximum limit. In their heads, they’re stocking up for a possible shortfall of milk. Meanwhile, there are crates piled up to the ceiling in the storeroom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When there is less of something, we tend to immediately think that the item must be of a higher value. Notice how everything from airline tickets to furniture could have this selling scheme stamped on them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Going Even Smaller&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1978.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;It makes sense to have the sale price in huge numbers. This would draw a customer’s attention, right? Research says otherwise. A smaller price in a smaller font looks even lower than it is. Hence, those who look at the new price would almost certainly purchase the item. This may occur even if the difference is negligible.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;10. Putting that English Degree to Sneaky Use&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1979.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Come to think of it, English majors may come in quite handy when it comes to marketing and pricing. Take a closer look when you open a menu at a high scale restaurant. You may notice a lot of detail on each item. The more expensive the food, the more detail there is. This may make many customers happy as they know what they’re getting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, restaurant owners are more concerned with emptying your wallet than to convenience you. Such detailed menus have actually been proven to increase restaurant revenues by a whopping 27%. So be very wary when you see the ingredients of a simple cheese pizza all spelled out for you. If you see brand names in the descriptions, that means the price is probably going to be jacked up even higher.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Using the Kids&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1980.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Look at the cereal section of your local supermarket. On a normal adult level, you have your cornflakes, bran flakes, and the muesli. However, look a little lower, and you would see bright, popping colors. Cartoons on the boxes are usually positioned to look straight at the kids accompanying their elders to the supermarket.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This means that the cereals marketed towards kids are placed just above the eye levels for a regular-sized child. Ever notice how all these characters seem to look downwards? That’s right! They’re looking directly at the kid, who would immediately want the box on their kitchen table.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. A Good Smell&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1981.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;At the supermarket or the mall, warm and enticing smell could permeate the air. This may create a comforting experience for you, but you should actually be on your guard. Warm scents usually make us feel like there’s not much space for us. To fulfill that feeling of smallness, we end up purchasing more. Moreover, we just don’t buy more, but we buy items that contribute to a feeling of luxury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The smells may also have a more direct effect. If they are good enough, they could make us crave for some sort of food. As a result, we load our cart without a thought about the cost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The scent of lavender is another popular supermarket tactic. It creates a relaxed feeling, which leads us to trust salespeople more. As the article may already have told you, these are among the last people you should trust.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Getting You Lost&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1982.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Sprawling carrefours, huge malls, and warehouse-like superstores often have us walking more than we meant to. In our forced explorations, we may stumble upon something that we didn’t know we wanted. That is, until the forcefully huge store brought it in front of us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Large and confusing store layouts are usually very deliberate. They are meant to trick buyers into shopping on autopilot. This means that they just start piling up whatever they want to buy, instead of looking for what they actually want.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This tactic is not just limited to stores like Ikea or Whole Foods. Even in the most basic superstore, you would find the necessities of life placed at the very back. On your way to get eggs, milk, and bread, you would probably pick up something that catches your eye. If they were at the very front, you would have just grabbed what you wanted and left.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. “Free” Stuff&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1983.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Many supermarkets offer free samples. However, feeding you means that you are now more likely to buy luxurious non-food items. For instance, a bit of chocolate could prompt you to be in an indulgent frame of mind. Your shopping would then increase according to this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Trying Things Out&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1984.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Be aware of tester options; they’re not just there to help you decide. In fact, testers and the option of trying things out give you a feeling of ownership. Once you touch something, you feel like it belongs to you. You may hence be ready to shell out more cash for it than otherwise. This is emotional manipulation at a very basic level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Music Masterminds&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1985.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Music playing in restaurants and stores has a direct impact on their patrons. No music can actually lower sales. However, the music has to be at a decent beat, and preferably popular. This would get the customers in a relaxed frame of mind. It would also allow them to enjoy themselves while mindlessly picking up more items.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. A “Bonus” for More Spending&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1986.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Many online and offline retailers offer a discount card or free shipping after you spend a certain amount. This amount is usually much higher than anyone would normally spend. With incentives like these, though, rational thinking often goes out the window.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Making Ordering Easy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1987.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Online stores are no less sneaky in getting money out of you. Now, many customers don’t have to fill in long forms for shipping or payment. They can pay with as little as one click. Amazon is probably the biggest website to offer this option.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ability to buy instantly doesn’t give one time to actually think about whether they need something or not. It may help if you turn off the one-click feature next time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Making Us Advertise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1988.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Advertising costs a pretty penny in this day and age. However, large companies and supermarkets are managing to make us advertise for them at no extra cost! This could be through stationary, free giveaways, or all kinds of sponsorships.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One glaring example, however, is the shopping bag. We usually buy reusable shopping bags in a bid to save the environment. They may even be given to us free of cost. However, familiarity with the brand name printed on the bags leads to us trusting this name more. We would not only buy their stuff but convince other people to do so when we carry the bag around. Maybe it’s time to ask for a compensation?&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Companies and supermarkets may be clever, but we can outwit them easily enough! Take a limited amount of you next time you shop. Make a list, and stick to it! It’s your hard-earned money, and they’re not getting their hands on it without good reason.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"19 Sneaky Tricks Companies Use to Make You Spend More","description":"We see many great deals on the market.
