One five year old boy however was concerned that his young had not been given food and brought her with himself to the front of the line to so that the adorable toddler could food. The Iranian authorities had set up facilities to provide relief to the people that had been displaced due to the powerful earthquake which rocked border regions of both Iran and Iraq. This deeply moving incident was caught on camera by someone who standing by and quickly went viral on social media including but not limited to Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1120.jpeg&quot;/&gt;cnn &lt;p&gt;The actions of the young five year old boy shows us all that despite the troubles and often selfish behavior of grownups children have; continue to remain as pure and innocent as ever and this incident has simply melted the hearts of millions across the World.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The powerful earthquake that has deeply devastated the Iran-Iraq border region has been simply a catastrophe for the communities living there as of now the earthquake is known to have claimed at least five hundred and thirty lives in addition to the loss of human life it has left eight thousand people injured only in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The western Iranian province of Kermanshah is where most of deaths and destruction occurred according to several local and international sources in the region.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Leading newspapers across the Islamic Republic of Iran have also decided to publish their front pages in Kurdish in a move to show solidarity with the earthquake victims who hail from a mainly Kurdish region in the western regions of the Islamic Republic of Iran.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The United States Geological Survey has revealed that the earthquake that hit Iran and Iraq measured was incredibly powerful and registered at a whopping 7.3 on the Richter scale.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The earthquake is reported to have struck at roughly 18:18 GMT on Sunday announced that a 7.3-magnitude earthquake struck the western regions of Iran and northeastern Iraq at 18:18 GMT on Sunday evening on the 12th of November, 2017.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The epicenter of the highly devastating earthquake it has been said is about thirty two Kilometers to the south west of Halabja; the city Saddam Hussain tried to gas in the Iran- Iraq war during the in 1980s. While the depth of the earthquake has been reported to be only 33.9 Kilo meters. The depth was extremely shallow and coupled with the raw power of the earthquake which registered 7.4 on the Richter scale has resulted in massive destruction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The earthquake could be felt as far away as the Iranian capital Tehran and the Iraqi capital city of Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1121.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Iran is no stranger to earthquakes. In 2013 a similarly destructive earthquake struck the Sistan Balochistan region of eastern Iran which registered at an even more devastating 7.7 on the Richter scale. Now, an increase of 0.1 on the Richter scale means a tenfold increase in the power of the earthquake. Thus for instance a 7.4 is ten times more powerful than a 7.3 and a 7.5 is ten times as powerful as a 7.4 and so on.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Poor construction means that the sheer scale of death and destruction caused by earthquakes is always on a massive and heart wrenching scale. The whole region including Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran are all prone to earthquakes and die to general and mass poverty of the region construction continues to be poor and very faulty.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"A Little Boy, in an Earthquake Hit Area, Brings His Friend Saying &quot;You Didn't Give Her Food.&quot;","description":"On Sunday 12th November the Iran- Iraq border region was hit by a devastating 7.3 earthquake.
