People are addicted to sending snaps streaks every day, putting up the stories of their daily routines and posting statuses about the fascinating things that are happening in their lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fairly recently memes and puns have taken over the world of social media. We tag our friends, post it on walls, laugh our heads off and even make some memes ourselves. Having many likes and comments on your status can be a good thing, but always be beware of posting things and always read it before pressing the Post button because you might get trolled, made a meme out of instantly. People are at no mercy I tell ya!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are some stupid people who are just like you and me, but they never thought before putting up their ideas on the Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and it got them into trouble with some sarcastic Chandler Bings of social media. Let’s see.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. Milk and Babies.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-789.jpeg&quot;/&gt;@oragul/pikabu  &lt;p&gt;Okay so apparently it is decided that human babies can take only human milk, cows milk is restricted to only cow babies. Wow. That right then soya milk will be for soya bean babies so what happens to skim milk?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do we have skim babies? Hey, I am just asking! Is it a crime?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Let’s help her out.  Shall we?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-790.jpeg&quot;/&gt;@Serega0661/pikabu &lt;p&gt;This poor girl wants to buy a thoughtful gift for her boyfriend. She asks everyone to help her find a gift because she has heard that presenting a watch to your loved one can lead to a breakup. Well, another thoughtful person helps her by saying, yes it was a gift his ex-gave it to him. I know what I am giving my boyfriend for Christmas this year. *Wink* *Wink*&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12.       Home run by NASA&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-791.jpeg&quot;/&gt;@menshumor/facebook  &lt;p&gt;We have all know NASA has the most genius employees ever. They have people with brilliant minds from all over the world. But what happens when an idiot crosses their path. What do they do? This man thinks he has a better plan for reaching the planets and the moon. What do you ask? Simply build a staircase to reach them. Wow!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NASA thought it was time to bring its most sarcastic players of all and score this one. They offered him a job. Who doesn’t want this genius away? He has cost-effective ways to reach the moon. Eh, Neil Armstrong. Why didn’t he think of it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11.       Too much blood in one picture.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-792.jpeg&quot;/&gt;@lashkov_74/twitter  &lt;p&gt;So, this guy has it all sorted out. He says if you murder a murderer that will make you a murderer too. So that won’t make any difference, right? Now you are a murderer too. To make the world in the order you should kill two murderers so that their remains only one murderer. That will be you. Okay, now I am tipsy!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10.       Wait! What?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-793.jpeg&quot;/&gt;@Lisichka1981/pikabu  &lt;p&gt;Shakespeare is getting tortured in his grave after seeing this and all the Grammar Nazis are puking all around the world. What in the world is this? Man, you are making a mistake twice and with full confidence. You should wash your eyes thoroughly after this I am going to nap a little. This is sickening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9.       Reality check.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-794.jpeg&quot;/&gt;@sonny5ideup/facebook  &lt;p&gt;Oops its too late for that reality check. There are other ways to find out who your real friends are missy you don’t have to go dumping around in every next guy you find. Sheesh! She needs some real friends who tell her about protection. Where do they make these idiots?&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;8.       Who says maturity comes with age?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-795.jpeg&quot;/&gt;@vk  &lt;p&gt;Wow and here I thought we all grow fish scales when we get older.  Who says age gives you more brains and intelligence? If that’s what growing up means, I am better at being a kid. Thank you, sir. Adios.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7.       Is it round? Is it flat?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-796.jpeg&quot;/&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This lady needs a noble prize. Hats off. She will win the peace award for this year for sure. She will rage a war against globalism. Ladies and my dear gentlemen, this is what you get when you want to be cool and you don’t know a word about it. That is overconfidence got trolled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6.       We all need these types of men in our lives&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-797.jpeg&quot;/&gt;@mpazu/pikabu  &lt;p&gt;And the award for the stupidest boyfriend goes to this guy. Like dude. Newsflash your girlfriend is the meanest person I have ever seen. You lost your scholarship and failed an exam for someone who doesn’t respect you or your hard work. You should look for a new girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5.   Hate against the moon.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-798.jpeg&quot;/&gt;/twitter  &lt;p&gt;This man has challenged Aristotle, Galileo, Socrates, and Plato. Apparently, he doesn’t believe in stars, moon, or any other planets. So, does that mean earth doesn’t exist? OMG! What are we living on? Do I exist? What is this all? I am confused.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4.   Shit That’s scary as hell.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-799.jpeg&quot;/&gt;@BitchyJasmine/twitter  &lt;p&gt;A new research has been introduced, behold now triplets will take twenty-seven months in their mother’s womb. Twins will take eighteen months. You know how one baby takes nine months before birth. That’s a lot of pain seriously. Never get triplets I tell ya!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Who are these people?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3.   Hey! Wait. That’s too much information to take in.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-800.jpeg&quot;/&gt;@OVLtech/vk  &lt;p&gt;What is the link between having one set of teeth and having babies and wait why on earth is nature here? who called her up? Why should my set of teeth have been related to taking care of my child for a brief time? This doesn’t make any sense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2.   That’s not my baby.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-801.jpeg&quot;/&gt;@MeninistTweet/twitter  &lt;p&gt;Can somebody get his facts straight! A woman gives birth doofus why she has to prove the baby is her. I swear they made a whole generation of idiots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1.   Break a leg.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-802.jpeg&quot;/&gt;@ata_pin/twitter      &lt;p&gt;They don’t write a book on women and their brains. It’s a complicated place. But a no is a no! Get that straight. Break a leg sister. Break a head.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"14 People Whose Ideas Might Get Them in Trouble","description":"Think a thousand times before posting on Social Media sites.
