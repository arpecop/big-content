Wait, don’t call that arrogant and highly mainstream doctor just yet. Check out these factors first to truly be able to decipher your internal business YOURSELF.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1088.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;If you feel that your stomach is suddenly puffing up then do not panic. Have faith in the trusted words of Robert Burakoff MD as he said “Unless it’s associated with weight loss, nausea, or vomiting, bloating is very common and usually not worrisome”. It’s often the nutrient enriched foods that could pump a little extra air in your tummy. Chowing down on beans, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, apricots, or carrots can lead to bloat, says Gina Sam, MD, director of the Gastrointestinal Motility Center at Mount Sinai Hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Foods high in lactose, dairy’s main sugar, and foods high in fiber, which can lead to the release of bloating gases hydrogen and methane, can puff you up too, says Dr. Burakoff. So if you’re munching down on those salads for that extra loss of calories, it will surely affect your internal system. We know you have to look fabulous for your up and coming ventures but would you rather risk your tummy for a good days pictures?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1089.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Do you read the label “sugar free” or “diet” and just be like “nothing can go wrong now can it” and munch on those sugar free biscuits or that third glass of “diet” coke which is acceptable since, of course, its diet so it is my curtain call. You’ll find the sugar substitute sorbitol in diet soda as well as in certain sugar-free foods and drinks and certain foods marketed as “diabetic.” Snack on this stuff enough, though, and you’ll notice your pants tighten up, says Dr. Sam. Sugar alcohols (such as mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, lactitol, and maltitol) are sometimes a cause of bloating and diarrhea if too much is eaten.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s more, soda contains phosphoric acid, which depletes calcium and magnesium—two nutrients help keep your immunity operating at peak efficiency. These foods and drinks might seem helpful and trustworthy at first but they are a menace for your tummy as they are to bloat and then gloat on your confusing and airy situation. In fact, it doesn’t even help your usual cause of weight loss as it turns out, any sweet taste, such as in diet sodas, signals body cells to store fat and carbohydrates, which makes you hungrier. Do you still think those sugar free digestives are worth it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1090.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Whether it’s a day of celebration or just the casual “I’m tired and rewarding myself” time of the week, drinks are to be at the forefront of our taste buds. It’s the fizz that allures us all such as the bubbles of champagne or the soda or the seltzer water. Champagne, soda, and seltzer water might seem like three very different drinks, but the carbonation in a bubbly beverage has the same effect on your stomach. Bubbles expand in your gut and could lead to a slightly bulging belly, says Dr. Sam. I know that fizz and those bubbles provide you with the spice you need at the time but it is not to be your friend in a few hours’ time; messing up your digestive system leading to long and uncomfortable trips to the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any alcoholic beverage could make your stomach puff up for multiple reasons, according to gastroenterologist Robynne Chutkan, MD. Alcohol wipes out the beneficial bacteria in your digestive system that normally keep bloat in check; it can lead to gastritis and liver damage, both of which cause bloat. So cut down on that celebratory champagne or that everyday dose of soda that “keeps you going” for if it persists, your tummy is to play with you in ways that are unknown to the very best of us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1091.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Of course, all of us love those refreshing and vibrant smoothies at Starbucks or Gloria jeans. For most of us, adding the fruit factor just makes it worth our while as it changes our perspective of the said item for we shove the argument of unhealthiness under the bed by saying “its fruit, god’s gift, what could go wrong?” Certain fruits, like watermelon, apples, pears, and mangoes, have a high ratio of fructose to glucose (both sugars occur naturally in fruit).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This can cause gas and bloating in the estimated one in three people who has difficulty digesting fructose. If this is you, stick to fruits with a more balanced fructose-to-glucose ratio, such as bananas and blueberries. Instead of just chugging down those Sweet, refreshing, thirst-quenching and at the same time, belly bloating jugs of smoothies, have some patience for the sake of your partner i.e. the trusted tummy and do him a favor by devouring drinks from the fruits that are to help the stomach rather than tease it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1092.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;If it’s not the ideal situation down there then it probably isn’t going to be one for your belly either. If you’re all backed up down there, it could leave your belly feeling heavy, says Dr. Sam. Check your diet and keep it according to a plan that suits your belly. Do not indulge into trying to do too much all at once which will just make things harder than they already are for you and your digestive system. Make sure you’re hydrated, and keep up with workouts as missing out on too much of physical exercise is to be a signal of failure for the stomach as it needs to keep running according to a set system.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Just you have a daily routine, your stomach has one too; probably more important than yours! But if there is still pain in the abdominals make an appointment with your doctor to make sure something else like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) isn’t at play. It’s simple but requires consistency. If you live according to a certain structure then your stomach is to abide by your rules and regulations but if you are to slack in the daily routine then your tummy is to falter as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1093.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;It’s that time of the year when you just want to relax and stop thinking about life’s worries for a limited but blissful period of time. But this has its flaws as well since it leads to people just forgetting their meal schedule as well as their sleep schedule. Almost 50 percent of people become constipated when they travel, says Connecticut gastroenterologist Ed Levine, MD.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know it’s time to forget about your worries but keeping a check on the time of meals is important as it is even when you aren’t on vacation unless you want to suffer the rest of your days in hotel room in the comfort of your bathroom; familiarizing you with the periodic visits and the disappointment to follow. Changes in your circadian rhythm throw off the hormones that help food and waste move through your gut. This is accompanied by an equally gruesome trip back home which lets the nausea really kick in; making you a nuisance for all the passengers willing to reach back in peace but only to be denied by your trusty steed; your belly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1094.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Stress and fear take a toll on you like never before when you have to meet a deadline at work. “I hear about stress complaints from my patients more than ever, and I have been in practice for 18 years,” said Dr. Lily Freidman. You have the reservation of everything being perfect but at the same time the ever-evolving stress and tension of whether you can make it in time. It is go time for you now as it is sink or swim for you. But between all the sinking and the swimming, we forget about our body and force it to suffer through different phases of different levels. When you experience fight-or-flight symptoms, like a racing heart, your body diverts blood flow away from your GI tract, which slows down digestion,” says Dr. Levine. Heavy breathing, which occurs when you’re under stress, makes you swallow more air than usual and can also lead to bloating. To feel better, simply change your breathing pattern so you exhale for a few counts longer than you inhale. This turns off the stress response and moves your body into a calmer state&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1095.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;It’s one thing letting loose for a day but to not engage in physical activity in weeks is close to your body and, most importantly, your belly committing suicide. The last thing you may want to do on a “fat day” is lace up your sneakers and squeeze into workout clothes. But You need those burpees and those jumping jacks in your daily routine for if they are to be present in your day to day ventures your stomach will run like a well-oiled machine but that is, obviously, subject to your commitment and dedication to the cause at hand; rescuing your tummy from potential suicide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Physical activity stimulates the muscles of your digestive tract, which helps move through your GI tract the food and air bubbles that make you feel bloated. In one small German study, people who took a post-dinner stroll significantly sped up the time it took their body to digest their meal. This just shows what a little bit of walking can get you. In order to melt that fat it is essential to up your digest game which is only possible if you are to be consisted and dedicated to the cause of reducing that bloating in your belly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1096.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;There’s a saying which say to win the war you have to bare the losses. We are stuck in quite a similar case when it comes to our stomach and its enemies which join forces to dismantle the structure and functions of the tummy. Infections are a tummy’s nemesis and are probably the most re-occurring and annoying of all infections. About 25 percent of patients who get gastroenteritis, a stomach infection, have bloating even after the illness clears. A likely suspect: small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In SIBO patients, abnormal levels of microbes colonize the small intestine, which can lead to gas and bloating, says Henry Lin, MD, chief of gastroenterology at the New Mexico VA Health Care System. Gastroenteritis can disrupt your defense mechanisms that normally keep bacteria out of the small intestine, leading to SIBO. It is typically diagnosed with a breath test and can be treated with antibiotics or other approaches. So if you’ve just encountered a stomach bug, then consider this a battle wound; patiently and steadily healing to make you better than ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1097.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com     &lt;p&gt;Irritable bowel syndrome is a common disorder that affects the large intestine. It is a disorder that’s characterized by stomach pain and a change in your bowel habits. It affects between 10 and 15 percent of the population. The presence of IBS can be generated biologically which means that it is based on your jeans as to whether you have IBS or not. Or it can develop in a body by certain circumstances which involve the factor of carelessness as people don’t consider the sugars and acids present in the food present in front of them as it could lead to its poor absorption which is to ultimately cause IBS. A viral or bacterial infection, such as the stomach bugs stated above could wound in such a way that is to scar you for life. Thus, it is important to keep a check on what you eat and how much you eat it. Otherwise, the consequences are just as uncomfortable as the situation you are in when suffering through a bloated belly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Perfectly Normal Reasons Your Belly Is Bloated","description":"Fix all your tummy problems"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/4/92f1b5db8cddbe4b68a19ffc1809c104_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/4/992b22245b776732510c12098b5f6194_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"3 Easy Ways to Make Sex Last Longer"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/4/8ebbe48450be6069228d72a812a3ad04_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"What to Do When You're Friend Tells You That They're Sad"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
