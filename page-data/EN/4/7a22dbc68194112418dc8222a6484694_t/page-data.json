There are certain rumors that the hip hop rapper asked his friends about a good baby name for the couple. However, Rose has neither announced nor denied the news about her status as a would-be mother.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sources close to the couple say that Savage21 is really interested and deeply involved with Amber Rose and it is not other worldly to assume they might decide to have a baby together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On September 30th she even send instagram into a debating frenzy as to her engagement with Savage21 with a picture of a jewelry on her hand. Rose quickly denied the rumors saying this was not her own hand she just saw a girl with some cute nail polish so she took her snap and her ring got in the way. So much for the excitement.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Up till now Amber Rose has not denied her pregnancy, so is that substantial enough?
