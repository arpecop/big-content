The crew of course have since been grounded as the navy was not too amused by their actions and the navy said on the Friday that the crew have been grounded for this action.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1215.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The plane or was one of the navy’s electronic warfare planes and on Thursday the Jet took off from Whidbey Island in the western part of the state of Washington. It is not known how many jets took part in this dastardly deed. The aerial acrobatics that resulted the drawing of a male penis did not go down too well with the top brass of the United States navy and has landed the concerned men in uniform in to some hot water over their swash buckling antics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1216.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The top brass of the navy have taken note and are clearly not amused with Vice Admiral Mike has also promised that the navy will look into the matter as images of the giant penis in the sky spread across social media like wild fire causing the United States Navy some serious embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1217.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;“The American people rightfully expect that those who wear the Wings of Gold exhibit a level of maturity commensurate with the missions and aircraft with which they’ve been entrusted,” said a clearly unamused Vice Admiral Mike Shoemaker. Vice Admiral Shoemaker is a three star ranked naval officer who is also the head of the head of operations of the navy’s air operations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Naval aviation continually strives to foster an environment of dignity and respect. Sophomoric and immature antics of a sexual nature have no place in Naval aviation today.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The navy is taking sexual harassment increasingly although the aim of this act is not yet clear. It is of course not the first time that pilots have gotten a bit creative while in the line of duty. In the United Kingdom a Royal Air Force pilot also drew a penis in skies over Scotland back in 2014.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In that incident the Royal Air Force concluded that the penis drawn was accidental and that the pilot was simply circling waiting to land and did not intent to draw the penis. On this side of the Atlantic the United States military is also no stranger to drawings of the male penis. Back in 2014 the Blue Angels a part of the US navy’s top notched flight demonstration squadron was also mentioned in an investigation in which members of the United States navy painted a male penis on the roof of a trailer in El Centro, California which also serves as the navy’s winter training center for the Blue Angels so that the pilots flying overhead could look down and see the penis from thousands of feet up in the sky.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The gold and blue painting was so jaw droopingly huge that navy investigation discovered that the image had been picked up on satellites and could even be seen on Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Captain Gregory McWherter, who was the commanding officer of the Blue Angels at the time of the incident was later investigated and was reprimanded for his abject failure to put a stop to sexual harassment in addition to this he was also taken to task for turning a blind eye to homophobia and pornography and in doing so violated the rules and policies of the United States Navy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Navy Pilot Draws a Penis in the Sky","description":"Yes that’s right a United States navy air crew decided to have some fun in the sky and ended up drawing a giant penis"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/4/11e13d7f6526bb59039a410ec888d394_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/4/16475d64a5e0ff1ee35daf5aa7e4d244_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Falling in Love Is Easy.
