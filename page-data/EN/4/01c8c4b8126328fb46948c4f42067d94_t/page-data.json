And reports claim she had not more than a 100 followers before she posted these surprising images on her instagram.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/4077164083-sahar-tabar-136931882.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;sahartabar_official/Instagram&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reportedly, she’s also on a strict diet to maintain her 40kg weight, which too is deemed as dangerously overweight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/19984972_481502398870343_4339130189846937600_n.jpg.a7fcfd3adf23d77f7e824fc528e104b9.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;sahartabar_official/Instagram&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her followers on Instagram though, have left some pretty unflattering comments on her pictures. One simple posted “Zombie” while another mentions the doctors have made her look like an 8 month corpse. Clearly not the reaction she was expecting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt; 😝 #sahartabar #sahar #sahartabarw_&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;A post shared by sahar tabar (@tabarsahar) on Apr 19, 2017 at 3:49pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sahar before undergoing the extreme transformation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sahar also has piercings in her cheeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/sahartabar2.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;sahartabar_official/Instagram&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are pictures of her that show her blonde hair and natural eye color on her Instagram.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/sahar-tabar.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;sahartabar_official/Instagram&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Jolie super-fan also uses contact lenses to adjust her natural eye color, in order to be more befitting of Jolie’s blue eyes. Below is a picture of her with her actual hair and eye color. Surprising, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/Sahar-Tabar-2.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;sahartabar_official/Instagram&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She’s also changed her hair color a number of times, recent pictures show Tabar with purple, blonde and black hair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/19367829_461435074221576_8026155632581148672_n.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps Tabar’s story is evidence these titles are influencing young people’s self-esteem, in a way which affects their perception of beauty, confidence and self-worth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of the 19-year-old’s posts get over 10,000 likes, and her appearance has certainly garnered much attention.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;But this news hasn’t really been officially confirmed by doctors and surgeons so this might just be a result of careful make up and prosthetics. But fans following her online say she looks ‘drastically different’ to previous posts. Let’s hope for Sahar’s sake it is just some photoshop trick.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"An Iranian Woman Has Gone Viral After Claiming She's Had 50 Surgeries in a Bid to Look like Her Idol Angelina Jolie.","description":"Teen underwent 50 surgeries to look like the Tomb Raider!"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/4/01c8c4b8126328fb46948c4f42067d94_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/4/0c8f75bee7be734b4a0fb1faea55e9d4_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Dad of Two Traveled 1,000 Miles to Have Sex with a 9-Year-Old Girl – but Didn’t Know It Was a Trap"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/3/fdf3dd01f9b1da336597e9bfa72376a3_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"This Woman Took a Photo of Herself Every Day for 1 Year, the Ending Will Stun You"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
