During pregnancy, a girl needs more and more love and care. It needs great effort by husband and concentration to keep her going and happy. Pregnancy brings incredible joy and severe pain together. All lot of changes in her life and health comes during pregnancy; she might go through insane cravings in the night or spend the whole night without sleeping. During pregnancy, all the pain and suffering a girl feels are worth suffering as she is going to hold a sweet little angel in her hand after delivery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-758.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Being a mom is not an easy task; the husband should understand and behave sensibly during her pregnancy period. He should take care of her and also take care of his words when he tries to say something to her. Here I have compiled the 6 phrases that man should avoid saying during her wife’s pregnancy time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. “Just Calm Down”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-759.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock  &lt;p&gt;Pregnancy is tough and girls start living a stressful life even from the very start of their pregnancy. Similarly, if your wife is suffering from the same situation then never tell her to calm down. Ask her about her emotions and feelings. Never argue with her during pregnancy or say just come down. Always try to be open and share her all issues with her intelligently and emotionally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. “Why are you crying again?”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-760.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock  &lt;p&gt;During pregnancy, a lot of hormonal changes occurs and change of these hormones take place from one tome to another, due to which females feel uncomfortable and sometimes they cry a lot. And this situation is completely normal. They don’t love crying but during pregnancy being emotional is not a different situation so when she cries never tell her to not do it again or ask for the reason for her cry. Instead just hold her hand in the peace and show her some love and support her in her hard times with affection and patience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. “You eat a lot”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-761.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock  &lt;p&gt;During pregnancy, a girl feels hungry a lot. Even if she had her meal an hour ago and now she is feeling hungry again. Don’t tell her that she is eating a lot. You just can’t say this that she eats all the time or remain hungry forever. Don’t tell her that she just ate an hour ago. Because during pregnancy if she does not eat when feels hungry she will get down which can affect the health of baby and mother. Don’t question about her easting a lot, instead help her by cooking something she loves with your hand and serve her with love, or buy snacks for her and keep them near to her so that she can eat them easily when feeling hungry, without bothering herself or anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;3. “I know how you feel”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-762.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock  &lt;p&gt;The pain and joy a girl feels during pregnancy can’t be determined by a man or husband. You can never understand her condition when he is in pain or suffering from cramps, having hunger cramps or any other feeling she is experiencing. This sentence possibly can be very painful to her that “I know how you feel.” So avoid saying it in front of her. Be supportive and her helping hand when she is in the pain. Show her some love and always try to be at her side whenever she needs you. Only a husband can calm her when she is in the pain of pregnancy so never leave her alone and stand by her in hard, yet joyful time of her life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. “House is getting messy”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-763.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock  &lt;p&gt;During pregnancy, even for a most cleanliness-loving girl, it becomes hard to take care of her house and husband and perform other household chores. She became unable to focus on anything. So never tell her that she is not taking care of anything and your house is getting messy. Don’t try to direct her during pregnancy that she needs to take care of the house and do everything properly. Instead of saying this to her you do it yourself in your spare time. Just be ready to set your entire house by yourself. Clean all the mess it will also relieve her and make effort to make your pregnant wife’s life easy and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. “This pregnancy is hard for me also”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-764.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock  &lt;p&gt;No doubt you do a lot for your wife and your upcoming child during her pregnancy but never tell her that this pregnancy is also hard for you and you are putting too much effort. Do everything silently for the sake of your child and wife as you also want to see your wife happy and child healthy once he/she came to this world. Do as much as possible for your future child and always offer your wife a helping hand. Take care of her a lot. As any such word will hurt her badly as you can’t feel her pain and sufferings that she is facing to give birth to your child.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Final Findings&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;These above described 6 phrases are not enough to avoid while your wife is pregnant. You also have to behave sensibly all the time in front of your pregnant wife. And be patient with her strange behaviour whenever she suffers from mood swings or argues with you. Never argue back with her instead handle every situation with calm.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Support her all the time without saying anything. Give her your loving company and exchange loving thoughts with her. Talk romantically about your future child and plan nicely for your child. Indulge her in loving thoughts of your happy family after she gave birth to your beautiful child.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"6 Sentences You Should Never Say to Your Wife When She's Pregnant","description":"Pregnancy is a gift from God and it is also a very delicate period of any woman’s life.
