For instance, there are very few lucky people who have found love on their first try. Relationships have been a talking point for a very long time. No one has ever mastered the art of a relationship as they keep changing and evolving with time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For men, however, it is imperative to be very cautious when thinking of a new relationship. Is it love? Is it infatuation? Every sensible man goes through these questions in his mind before starting a life with someone. Usually, women have it easier because as everyone knows, they mature faster than men!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order to have a healthy relationship, one must learn how to differentiate between love and all other emotions. This is the most important thing one has to consider before a relationship. For instance, love never ages. It only increases with time. Infatuations, on the other hand, go on for a certain amount of time and fade, eventually. Love develops slowly while infatuations strike rapidly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the midst of all this, men all over the world are doing certain things in their relationships that they think are correct. However, we have compiled a list of all the essential actions a man should take in order to keep and ensure a healthy and genuine relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#1: Say NO to domestic abuse&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2206-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Domestic abuse, or beating your wife, is something you should never do. No matter what the circumstances, domestic abuse is never a justifiable action.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All it does is display cowardice and prove that you are not a mentally stable person. There is no situation that cannot be handled by rational means. Having a discussion rather than resorting to violent means not only leads to a solution for that issue but also shows that the relationship is healthy and genuine. Moreover, domestic violence has a lot of consequences. It can lead to physical and mental scarring and can also damage a person’s ability to trust and love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#2: Give importance to her!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2206-2-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Your wife is your greatest asset. Not only is she your partner, she is also your friend. If you’re ever stuck in a situation, be it about work or even choosing the color of shirt to wear- consult her!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Show her that her opinion counts. Listen to her and never belittle her. Pay attention to what she says and make her participate in your everyday life, and vice versa. Also, include her in your decisions and ask for suggestions! She lives with you; make her feel like it, too. This will ensure the presence of a healthy household and will bring out the best in both of you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#3: Keep a check on her wellbeing.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2206-3-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Being a husband, it is your moral responsibility to make sure your wife is mentally and physically fit. She is your partner and you owe her care and attention, just like she owes you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Always make sure that your lady is calm and has peace of mind. Listen to her when she talks, and try your level best to understand her. If you cannot, carry on with the conversation until you reach a mutual agreement. Show her that you care and do your utmost to ensure she is happy and content with her life. Encourage her and support her choices and decisions. In this way, you will be doing wonders for yourself and your relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#4: Choose your company!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2206-4-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Always choose your friends wisely. Your company has quite an influence on your personality and behavior.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having friends that lack credibility and mindset will only harm you, and eventually, your relationship. Their bad habits and negative thoughts will sit deep with you and slowly start to eat away on your positivity and demeanor. This way, you might start neglecting your wife and damage the relationship as a result. Therefore, always choose your company wisely. Good friends will bring good things to the table.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#5: Never hurt her.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2206-5-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Never ever hurt your wife, no matter what you are going through.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you will get into fights. Your wife will insult you or say hurtful things. This will prop you up too. However, by no means, does this mean that you can hurt your wife back. If she says something hurtful, stay silent. Then, at a later time, explain to her that it hurt you. Hurting her back by saying demeaning things will get you and your relationship nowhere. In fact, it will make sure that the levels of trust deplete.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Always try being the bigger person and help yourself and your wife out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#6: Never ward her ideas off!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2206-6-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;In certain stages of life, your wife will bring new perspectives and ideas to the table. While they may not always be matching yours, do listen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Listening to your wife and paying attention to her ideas and suggestions is probably the most important thing you’d be doing in order to grow your relationship. Accept her ideologies and theories; if you can’t, disagree respectfully. Never be petty and always keep your ears peeled for ideas and advice. Who knows, she may be making more sense than you!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#7: She isn’t your slave!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2206-7-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;You married a human, not a robot!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t ever treat your wife as your personal servant, simply because she isn’t one. She isn’t here to do your chores and work all the time. She’s here to share a life with you. Making her work around the house and being lazy is one of the worst qualities you can demonstrate. Therefore, make sure she is relaxed and rested. In fact, start helping her out with the housework!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#8: Don’t mock her and don’t backbite!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2206-8-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Never make fun of your wife!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter how ridiculous you might think she is, never make fun of her. What stays in your home, remains there. Making a mockery out of her in front of your own family is the most cowardly thing you can do. Also, it guarantees an instant decrease in trust and brings about doubt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you feel like your wife is lacking somewhere, sit with her and have a chat instead of going public with her flaws. Don’t show your friends or family that your wife is a burden. She isn’t; she’s a blessing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#9: Clear out her past from your mind.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2206-9-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;In some cases, your wife is bound to have a past with one or two people who didn’t turn out to be the right person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this case, however, be accepting and open-minded about it. Keep in mind that she is human too, and isn’t perfect. Convince yourself that the past doesn’t matter; what matters is that she is with you right now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Try to accept her and imagine yourself in her situation. Never doubt her. If she says she loves you and does everything to prove it, you have nothing to worry about, at all. Also, think about the fact that your wife wouldn’t be the beautiful person she is today if not for her past. Prove to her that you are the right person for her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t you want to be accepted, too?&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;#10: Be a responsible human being.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2206-10-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Every woman likes a man who is responsible. Your wife will surely dig you if you have a good work ethic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Try keeping yourself up to date with your home and its welfare. Make sure you’re fulfilling your responsibilities as a man and a husband. Work hard and keep your priorities straight. Never, for a minute, go lenient on your tasks. Remember that you are responsible for your family. Women always find the strongest male to start a family with. This is all the more reason for you take control!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prove to her that you’re mentally strong. Keep up a good work ethic and who knows, she might join in too!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#11: Never compare her!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2206-11-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;DON’T DO IT!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is an instant turn off in any circumstance. If you can’t accept your wife for who she is and will constantly compare her to another female, well then you don’t deserve her. How would you feel if she compared you to another guy? Exactly!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Always love her wife and accept all her sides; crazy, irrational, lovable, etc. love her in every instance and every season and most importantly, love her for who SHE is. Accept her silliness and join in with her!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#12: Cheating – should we even say this?!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2206-12-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Cheating is always a no-go in any situation. Granted your wife has flaws and she’s imperfect, and Julia from work is much more attractive, but cheating is the worst thing you can do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you love someone, all you think about is them. Chris Evans says from the movie ‘Before We Go’: “When you’re committed to somebody, you don’t allow yourself to find perfection in someone else.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t think anything else needs to be said. Chris nailed it! Cheating is the worst sin you can commit. Never do it no matter what the circumstances. If you don’t find yourself attracted to your partner anymore, just tell them. This would be better than going behind their backs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#13: Let your love grow.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2206-13-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Love is an emotion that develops slowly. It most certainly never dies and keeps increasing in quantity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It expands a person’s heart and changes them from head to toe. When it comes to your wife, you must never let your love stop from growing. Always find beauty in her and make sure you love her more and more each day. This way, not only will she feel like the happiest woman on earth, you will also be doing wonders for your relationship. Also, it will help you grow in ways you could never imagine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#14: Appreciate her!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2206-14-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Whenever your wife does something for you, be the first one to appreciate her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember that she is a different person and will do things rather differently than how you would do them. Accept her love and care and appreciate her efforts whenever she does something for you. A little bit of appreciation goes a long way and establishes an unbreakable bond of love and care. Treat your wife the way you would want to be treated and always keep an open heart when it comes to her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#15: Hide her flaws!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2206-15-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Your wife is human, just like you. She has flaws and she isn’t perfect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being a husband, it is your moral obligation to cover up her flaws and embrace her as she is. If there is something about her that is harmful to her, talk to her about it. Help her with her issues as she is your friend. Give her useful advice and never discuss her flaws with anyone in public or private. Keep those things between the two of you and the world –your world –will be a happier place!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#16: Never belittle her.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2206-16-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Belittling your wife is something you must never do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Never ever call her insulting names, as that just reflects the kind of person you are from the inside. Instead, call her lovingly and make sure she smiles every time she is called upon by you. Be the happiness she always wanted. Don’t indulge her into negativity and always try to make her happy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#17: Your wife should come first.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2206-17-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;No matter what happens, your wife is the person who has the most rights on you. She lives with you and you spend the greatest amount of time together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For this reason, and many others, your wife should always come first, whether it is work or even friends. Not to say you should ignore the others; just give your wife the time and care she deserves. Make sure she always comes first and try to fulfill her needs. A happy woman will make sure she keeps you happy as well!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#18: Transparency is the key to success!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2206-18-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Never hide anything from your wife. May it be a friend trying to talk to you, or an ex-girlfriend trying to reconnect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your wife is your life partner and your best friend. She deserves every bit of transparency you can give her. This will reassure her that you are honest and sincere and will develop a relationship based on trust. Transparency is the key to a happy and successful relationship; try it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#19: Be grateful!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2206-19-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Your wife has been with you through thick and thin. She has loved you in times you have found difficult to love yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be grateful to your wife and thank the heavens for her presence in your life. Appreciate her presence and never miss a chance to tell her how much you love her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;#20: Love her forever!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2206-20-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Your wife will always be constant in your life. Your children will marry and go and live their own respective lives.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Your wife spends a significant amount of her lifetime with you. In order to achieve happiness, always love her and show her how much you care about her, regardless of time and age. Keep her happy by showing affection and never let your relationship be tied down by anything or anyone. The key to a happy relationship is love! So love abundantly, and enjoy these little pleasures of life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"20 Must Follow Rules for Men to Have a Perfect Relationship and Happier Love Life","description":"For a successful relationship, all one needs is trust and care.
