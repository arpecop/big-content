So can we imagine how these penitentiaries treat all the crooks out there? No actually, we can’t. But yeah, of course, we know that it’s bad, like really bad. ‘Prison’ is a scary word after all, and we know what it means. Remember The Shawshank Redemption? That was one remarkable movie of its time. Andy Dufresne still couldn’t get convinced to stay after seventeen years of prison and escaped anyway. So what is it about these prisons that is just so dreadful? Like all prisons, these are also made to house criminals. No criminal wants to get caught and go to jail but do we have some exceptions? Well, let’s have a look.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prisons are intended to teach those felons a lesson they’ll never forget. But today we have a list of all those prisons where these reprobates live more like at home than like a jailbird. Here are the 10 luxurious prisons in the world only open for rich people:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sollentuna Prison&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; Looks like a luxury apartment doesn&#39;t it? Welcome to Sollentuna Prison in Sweden #BeautifulPrisons #PulseGhana&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Pulse Ghana (@pulseghana) on Mar 18, 2016 at 6:34am PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This prison in Sweden is more like a four-star hotel that gives the feeling of living in a well-furnished apartment. It’s like the prisoners are behind bars, yet they’re not exactly imprisoned. They have their room, their kitchen, their living room, and even a gym! Eat, exercise, sleep, and relax; live a perfect life but just don’t go out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sollentuna serves its prisoners well inside the four walls. However, the aim is not to be generous with these prisoners despite their criminal activities. The director general of this Swedish prison says that their purpose is to guide these inmates towards what’s right and try to eradicate as many prisons from the country as possible. Over the course of time, the number of prisons in Sweden has fallen to a great extent. The goal is to make the inmates see and learn how to appreciate all the good things and live a normal happy life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Addiewell Prison&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Drug dealer cleared of torching prison officers’ motors outside Addiewell nick https://t.co/lqhJn8tSZk pic.twitter.com/VSfvMVaFzr&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— The Scottish Sun (@ScottishSun) January 27, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ever heard of a prison holding instructive classes for its prisoners? No? Well, now you have. Addiewell Prison is situated in the village of Addiewell, Scotland, and is known as a “learning prison.” Here, the inmates are given proper classes and are educated about their mistakes. The goal seems to be somewhat similar to that of Sollentuna Prison; to eliminate crime and prisons by educating the prisoners. This helps the inmates to grow into a more self-aware person, and they become an example for all the new inmates for how they can correct themselves and live a righteous life. The inmates support the teaching staff by helping other prisoners with their learning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Addiewell Prison provides a nice homey décor to make the prisoners feel like at home so they can spend their prison sentences in a comfortable environment surrounded by positive learning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aranjuez Prison&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;PANIK: Napi diperbolehkan membawa keluarganya utk tinggal bersama di dlm penjara bernama Aranjuez Prison di Spanyol #JAKARTAMORNINGSHOW pic.twitter.com/0uEniuS6y4&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— OZ Radio Jakarta (@OZRadioJakarta) March 30, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Known as the worlds’ five-star prison, Aranjuez Prison in Spain is the only one of its kind that locks up families together. Yes, it’s true. Families live together in these confined rooms so that they don’t lose their bonding. Children are given birth to and raised behind bars until parents complete their prison sentences. The Aranjuez Prison provides a normal life for these innocent little creatures by sending them off to nursery school, letting them mingle up with each other and make friends. They are provided with a fully equipped playground to play and enjoy their time before they are put behind bars with their parents when the curfew starts. In a way, this seems unfair to the children as it is depriving them of their due freedom, but family bonding is given preference here. Moreover, it is believed there that if children get to stay with their parents, they’ll get familiar with the penalties for dabbling in crime. The children are given away to relatives or foster care at age three.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;JVA Fuhlsbuettel Prison&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-28-9-2225-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt; // Facebook &lt;p&gt;This lavish prison is situated in Germany. While it is a prison to confine felons, it does not look like a place of imprisonment. Instead, it is a castle with a fantasy to it. Looking at its picture might remind you of the Beast’s castle. The JVA Fuhlsbuettel Prison is a luxurious place for inmates where they are provided with facilities like private prison cells, private shower, and a TV room. Also, the inmates can do their laundry too. These people are imprisoned in this castle of luxuries in a clean and entertaining environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Champ-Dollon Prison&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Champ-Dollon Prison, Switzerland &amp;amp; Nigeria Police Force Barracks, Lagos.

It is one the unique and luxurious prisons of all times. Champ-Dollen faced downfall issues as earlier the jail seemed more crowded with diseases than with inmates. But with a funding of $40 million, the problem was solved. Now the prison provides spacious three-bed cells with a private shower. However, the inmates are kept behind bars for 23 hours a day and allowed one hour out of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;Bastoy Prison&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bastoy prison in Norway. Humbled and awed by this place &amp;amp; people who live &amp;amp; work there. pic.twitter.com/nXYQMA2Qgn&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Laura Rovner (@llrovner) September 15, 2016&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This summer-camp type prison is located in Bastoy, Norway. And by summer-camp, yes it means a place to be energetic and do crazy things. This jail is like a farmhouse where every prisoner lives in their cottage like an ordinary human being. The authorities believe that humans should be considered humans, and treated with courtesy and care. This special kind of prison is designed to let the inmates live a normal life and move on from their past. The authorities say that we value human sentiments and this is a way to let our inmates become aware of their duties and their role in life. The Bastoy Prison aims at promoting human values and tolerance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The prisoners at Bastoy Prison – or farm basically, are more like on a vacation where they can enjoy leisurely activities like horse-riding, skiing, tennis, and fishing. So more like a summer camp than a punishment, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Halden Prison&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Maximum-security Halden Prison, designed by Erik Møller Architects, has no armed staff and a design focus on social &amp;amp; mental rehabilitation. pic.twitter.com/euvcFHqzG8&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Michael Poos (@michaelpoos) September 25, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Norway intends to make a civilized man out of its inmates. The Halden Prison in Norway respects human rights and perhaps believes in the equality of humans, and so makes no difference between the inmates and a common citizen. They do things a little differently at Halden. The prisoners are provided with designer furniture, a private bathroom, own TV, and a mini-fridge. It’s like it is a second home for these inmates. Halden Prison builds trust and understanding among the prisoners letting them live their life as if they were free. The goal is to bring these inmates towards betterment by inculcating in them good social and cultural values.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Justice Centre Leoben&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;[5 THINGS] 1.

The prison cells look more like apartments, and the inmates are allowed to move here and there inside the building. They are provided with a separate bathroom and kitchen where can cook for themselves if they feel like it. The prison provides many indoor enjoyable facilities like sports such as tennis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cebu Jail&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; At that time I got the burn for the very first time…#cebujail #cebu #phlippines #세부교도소#세부#필리핀세부 #필리핀&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by Alice (@alice_mhshin) on Dec 12, 2016 at 4:18am PST&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This one of a kind prison in Philippines rather deserves to be called a dance lessons institute than a jail. Yes, Cebu Jail holds proper dance classes led by a professional choreographer. The inmates are made to exercise on a daily basis on tracks by famous artists like Michael Jackson. They are encouraged to keep on going this way by providing them public fame. Their dance videos are posted on YouTube and that is how they get known. They first received recognition when their dance video on the famous song “Thriller” was posted online. Although not on individual level, but they gained acknowledgment as group performers from the Cebu Jail. These inmates have been performing dances for public for ten years now. The jail sets up different shows where visitors can come watch these talented prisoners perform incredible dances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pondok Bambu Jail&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pondok Bambu Prison, in Indonesia, is a women&#39;s prison that makes luxury rooms available for purchase; however, some inmates also bribe their way into these rooms illegally.Source: Al Jazeera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Posted by Mya Tun on Saturday, June 17, 2017&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This all women’s jail in Indonesia is more like a dream vacation for all the female drug addicts and murderers in the country. What ordinary women go crazy after is what is given to them for punishment at Pondok Bambu Jail. Besides the regular treatment for prisoners, the ladies here at Pondok Bambu receive luxurious facilities like a professional salon and spa. Their health and beauty is taken good care of and they are provided beading classes. These inmates are provided with their private maids running errands for them and making them feel as comfortable as if they were the queens of their palace. This is to inculcate in them self-confidence and help them into forgetting their past and look up to the future in front of them. The salon is basically aimed at grooming them into a self-aware member of the society. So who wouldn’t want to go to a jail like that where you would be treated as Miss World? Even though a confinement from the outside, but a luxury palace from within.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;These luxurious prisons make the stay of inmates bearable as they allow them to live normally and carry on with a relatively normal life. So does it make every one want to become a criminal yet?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"12 Prisons More Luxurious Than Your College Dorms!","description":"Can’t say anything about it being a prison, but it sure is a castle with a fantasy to it."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/4/d6dfe38f32ee1e7e0e90ac40139ae4b4_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/4/d8c4e483f041332c813e276a4ee25d64_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"12 Things That Will Save Your Life in a Critical Situation"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/4/cfb8758e4833ae84fceeaa35f24b8804_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"My Cat Welcomes Me Everyday When I Come Home :)"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
