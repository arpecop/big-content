But, not only does he sing to himself he sings to his patients to soothe their nerves. We can’t get over how charming and talented this third-year residence at Mayo Clinic is!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of us can’t even imagine what the life of a surgeon must be like, that is unless you’re a fan of Grey’s Anatomy. In that case, you have a pretty rough idea. But, even a show can’t fully capture the true essence of being responsible to save another human being’s life!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Music for the soul.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The long tedious hours, the horror of losing a patient, can definitely put a burden on your soul. Thank God for music because that’s just the cure for this doctor’s distress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr.Francois tries to get through those hard days with a little music to lift his spirits. The orthopedic surgeon escapes his reality by singing tunes on his breaks. He slips away into empty operating rooms to sing to his heart’s content.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;I’m feeling good&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The viral video shows Dr. Francois in an empty operating room, staring straight into the camera, and singing an all-time classic “Feeling Good” by Nina Simone. And to our surprise, the handsome doctor has got the voice of an angel. We wouldn’t mind taking a trip down to his operating room for a concert. This video will have even the gloomiest smiling and feeling good.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;Spread the love.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, this doctor doesn’t just keep his talents hidden. He sings to his patients to try and calm them down, and be more at ease. The doctor voice sure has worked it’s magic on us. We wouldn’t be surprised if he became a rock star overnight. What a total catch! Good looks, a doctor, and he can sing. We are heads over heels for this man.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Music is the best medicine.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Music has always been a matter of Energy to me, a question of Fuel. Sentimental people call it Inspiration, but what they really mean is Fuel. I have always needed Fuel. I am a serious consumer. On some nights I still believe that a car with the gas needle on empty can run about fifty more miles if you have the right music very loud on the radio.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;― Hunter S. Thompson&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He took his pain and turned it into something beautiful. Into something that people connect to. And that’s what good music does. It speaks to you. It changes you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;― Hannah Harrington, Saving June&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And, maybe just maybe be, music is the best thing out there to save our souls. A few years back I had my own battle with depression and what seemed like an eternity of darkness, without even realizing it, got better. My road to recovery was mainly thanks to my music.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Knowing that there are artists and people out there who understand what I’m going through gave me hope that I’m not alone and I can get better. Music has this magical power of making even the darkest of days a little brighter and a good day even better. It helped me get back to my old self, if that isn’t the best medicine for your soul then I don’t know what is.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Doctor Takes A Break Between Trauma Surgeries To Sing, And The end Is Beautiful","description":"You won’t believe what an amazing voice this surgeon has!
