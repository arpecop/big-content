If you ever tried doing a BBQ with friends while camping, we all face the biggest problem – starting the fire. Once the fire has started, the process is easier on from there. Just simply use an egg carton as it catches fire instantly. If you put branches into it, it will act as a cover and will not be exposed to the winds blowing around you. Even if the branches are a little damp, the carton will help it catch fire as it’s cordoned off from all sides and creates and closed space and more heat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Number # 11&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-462.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tapoos.com&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We might not always have drinking water available to us. And if we end up having water that is not filtered – it could lead us to get sick very quickly. It can even give us diseases that are water borne. The easiest way to filter water is to use a water bottle and a piece of our T-shirt. Make a container out of that water bottle, and put the dirty water in one container. Use another container to have place for the filtered water. Dip the cloth in both the containers, each respective end in each container. After an hour you will see that the cloth absorbs the water, filters it and starts to transfer it on the other side. In case you want to be safer than this, you can always boil the water to kill the germs further.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Number # 10&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-463.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;If you plastic or other things are not available, you can use a crayon instead of a candle. Candles burn way quicker than for example a crayon, so using this as a light stick of starting a fire would be a good idea. The crayon is made out of materials that catch fire instantly and if you burn it, it will keep burning for at least half an hour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Number # 9&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-464.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;There are times that we end up going to places and forget to wear clothes that are warm enough. If we are stuck in a place and do not find fire or any body heat to warm ourselves up with, an easier solution is to find some grass. If we just make bunches of grass and place it inside out jackets, it will start to warm us up. One does not want to end up with hypothermia or getting sick in a critical situation like this.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;Number # 8&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-465.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;We have already told you how to protect yourself from water borne diseases and weather – the third thing you should be most concerned with are the insects.

This will not just keep the insects away it will also repel the animals in the forests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Number # 7&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-466.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Bu in case any insect ends up making it to its destination and biting us – there is always a solution.

And just place the leaf and needle on the water, the side which you rubbed on your jeans will automatically start pointing towards north.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Number # 1&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-472.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com     &lt;p&gt;If you are not a fan of watching documentaries on Nat Geo – you will not know anything about snakes.
