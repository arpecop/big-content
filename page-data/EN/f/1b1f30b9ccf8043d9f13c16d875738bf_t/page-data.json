It’s time we finally we paid attention to the lesser known breeds of the &lt;em&gt;Canis Familiaris. &lt;/em&gt;No, we aren’t talking about Huskies, Labradors or Bulldogs – we literally mean ‘less’! Here are the top 10 smallest breeds of household dogs in the world. We hope this list will encourage you to bring one of these little friends into your household.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Pug&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1627.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The pug has forever been known as the dog that people can’t decide is cute or ugly. We like to say it goes either ways – it’s so ugly that it’s cute and it’s so cute that it’s ugly. The pug originates from China and is also known as “Multum in parvo”, which translates to “much in little”. This breed grows to 10 to 12 inches or 25 to 30 centimetres in height and weighs between 14 to 20 pounds or 6 to 9 kilograms. It’s characterized with a compact and barrel-chested body, round head and flat, dark snout. In terms of personality, the pug has a strong will and is hardly ever aggressive. They are suited for most households and absolutely adore children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Pekingese&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1628.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;It seems that the Chinese prefer small dog breeds, considering that the next breed on the list also hails from there. The Pekingese possesses high intelligence and also some self-importance – rightfully so, as the breed was preferred by Chinese imperials for centuries. Out of all the breeds in this list, the Pekingese has most muscular body, albeit still small and stocky.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compared to its body, it has a large head and flat face and muzzle. The Pekingese grows to a height of 6 to 9 inches or 15 to 23 centimetres and weighs between 7 to 14 pounds or 3 to 6 kilograms. Don’t be mistaken by its small frame, though. This little dog has a lot of personality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Bolonka&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1629.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;This Russian breed is sturdy with a playful and loving disposition. They were bred to be companion dogs, thus they only reach 7 to 10 inches or 17 to 25 centimetres in height and weigh about 4 to 11 pounds or 2 to 5 kilograms. The Bolonka has a characteristic dense but soft coat of fur that grows in waves or large curls. Their fur requires constant maintenance, especially around the eyes. Their coats vary in colour from black to brown-and-white to different combinations of these three colours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Maltese&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1630.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Known as the gentlest dog breed, the Maltese has a single layer coat which hangs straight. It grows to be 8 to 10 inches or 20 to 25 centimetres and weighs between 7 to 9 inches or 3 or 4 kilograms. The Maltese originates from the Mediterranean Basin and has grown increasingly popular around the world. Like most small dogs, they also suffer from severe separation anxiety when they are left alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Biewer Terrier&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1631.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com  &lt;p&gt;Hailing from England, is both elegant and arrogant. The Biewer Terrier has long, straight and silky hair that ranges from black, brown and white in colour. They also have a cute little beard. The Biewer Terrior reaches up to 7 to 9 inches or 18 to 23 centimetres in height and 4 to 8 pounds or 2 to 4 kilograms in weight. In terms of personality, they are light hearted, childlike and very obedient. The breed requires constant attention and a large space to roam around and play in. Overall, very good, child friendly pets.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;5. Pomeranian&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1632.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The best way to describe the German-born Pomeranian is an energetic ball of fur with a loving, demanding and egoistic personality. This breed weighs between 4 to 8 pounds or 2 to 4 kilograms and grows to be 6 to 8 inches or 15 to 20 centimetres tall. They come in many colours and patterns, from black to white to even a rare purple. The Pomeranian has a characteristic curly tail and thick coat that forms a sort of mane around their head. They prove to be excellent pets as they are friendly to humans and other animals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Prazsky Krysarik&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1633.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Also known as “Prague Ratter”, this breed originates from the Czech Republic and has a lot of energy and playfulness. It reaches only 8 or 9 inches or 20 to 23 centimetres in height and weighs about 2 to 6 pounds or 1 to 3 kilograms. They become emotionally attached to every single member of the family, leading to severe separation anxiety. Their slim and delicate body is further defined by a sleek, glossy coat of fur in mostly black and tan colour. This breed frequently suffers from “Small Dog Syndrome”, in which the dog believes they are the pack leader dominating their human, thus proper care and attention is required.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Yorkshire Terrier&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1634.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com  &lt;p&gt;A typical toy dog breed, the Yorkshire Terrier – or “Yorkie” – is energetic and loves comfort. They prefer being a lap dog, which isn’t difficult considering that they only weight between 4 to 7 pounds or 2 to 3 kilograms and grow up to 5 to 7 inches or 13 to 18 centimetres tall. Their fur has a mixture of colour combinations, such as black and tan, and has a fine and silky texture. The breed hails from a part of England and were used by the working class to hunt rats and mice in buildings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Chihuahua&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1635.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Arguably one of the most popular toy dog breeds in the world, the Chihuahua originates from Mexico and is one of the oldest dog breeds from the American continent. They are perfect for urban area living such as apartments due to their compact size. They are tiny, weighing between 3 to 7 pounds or 1 to 3 kilograms and standing at only 6 to 9 inches or 15 to 23 centimetres. They prove to be excellent family pets as they are brave, loyal and courageous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Russkiy Toy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1636.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The smallest dog breed in the world originates from Soviet Russia. The Russkiy Toy is calm, thoughtful, trusting and loving but is also prone to “Small Dog Syndrome” if not trained properly. They grow to be about 8 to 10 inches or 20 to 26 centimetres tall and weigh only 3 to 6 pounds or 1 to 3 kilograms.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;That’s just about a gallon of milk! The breed has both short-haired and long-haired types and are characterized by small heads, thin bodies and long legs. They are suited for every kind of household and prove to be terrific companion dogs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Top 10 Smallest Dog Breeds You Have Never Seen Before","description":"Introducing your new favourite miniature canines."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/f/1b1f30b9ccf8043d9f13c16d875738bf_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/f/244a210508d850bf760cdef6ed0a2d4f_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"What Our Favorite Actors from Titanic Look like After 20 Years"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/f/192d36d62b545abb5075335174b2f55f_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"31 Amazing Facts to Make You Instantly Smarter"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
