Depending on your birth month you are assigned an animal totem which signifies your spirit animal and correlating traits. It is somewhat similar to western astrology as it too takes into account celestial systems to predict the future.

Hence the animal signs are given special meaning in Native zodiac wisdom. According to Native American cultures, a birth is an initiation where life never ends rather incarnates on the wheel of reincarnation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your birth totem animal will be like a guide for you on how to lead your life as an individual and also on a collective level. They will hold the qualities exclusive to your person. Personal characteristics, your attitude towards different aspects of life, your talents and shortcomings are revealed by your corresponding spirit animal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As already established that Native American astrology borrows from the celestial understanding hence these animal totems are also referred to as solar totems. It not only takes the aspects of solar system but also shifts in the seasons and the ever changing phases of moon. It strives to give an individual a better understanding of their place in Mother Nature and how best to conduct themselves personally and on a collective conscious level. They respect the balance in all things and forewarn an individual of their interactions.
