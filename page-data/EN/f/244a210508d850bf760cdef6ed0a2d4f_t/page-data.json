Released in December 19, 1997, the movie broke worldwide records and was the highest grossing film of all time for 13 years. With its impeccable cinematography to its expensive production to its stunning visual effects, it was the first movie of its kind to win the hearts of so many and effectively portray a real-life tragic disaster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, a movie is given its finishing touches by its actors and, in this case, the actors contributed immensely to &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt;’s success. From the major to the side actors, they all performed brilliantly to create memorable characters and genuinely tear-jerking scenes. But have you wondered where they are now, 20 years later? Here’s a peak at their lives post-&lt;em&gt;Titanic &lt;/em&gt;success.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Kate Winslet (played Rose DeWitt Bukater)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-137.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Erikia // Jamescameronstitanic.wikia &lt;p&gt;Kate Winslet insisted director James Cameron on playing the role of Rose after reading the script, which she said made her cry. She was eventually nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Following the immense success of &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt;, she chose to star in smaller independent films such as &lt;em&gt;Hideous Kinky&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Quills &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Eternal Sunshine for The Spotless Mind&lt;/em&gt; and turned down blockbusters like &lt;em&gt;Shakespeare in Love&lt;/em&gt;. Winslet’s acting in her recent release, &lt;em&gt;The Mountain Between Us &lt;/em&gt;was praised by critics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Billy Zane (played Caledon Hockley)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-138.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Erikia // Jamescameronstitanic.wikia &lt;p&gt;Zane continued as an active actor and producer.
