Unlike many teenage girls who have their first experiences in the back of old trucks, the cars of their lovers or some other less than exotic location. Nineteen year old American model decided to sell her virginity which was sold in an online auction for an astounding sum of 2.5 million euros or close to 3 million US dollars, to an obviously wealthy yet unnamed businessman from the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1244.jpeg&quot;/&gt;pressks.com &lt;p&gt;The model who gave her name as Giselle put her virginity up for sale on a German website aptly named Cinderella Escorts. She says that she wants to use the money to fund her higher education, the exorbitant costs of which are well known and have led many students to take up such things as sugar babying which critics say is just prostitution plain and simple but disguised under a different name.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1245.jpeg&quot;/&gt;vladtv.com &lt;p&gt;According to Giselle she did not expect her virginity to be such a highly valued thing and never expected the bid to up as high as it did. “I would never have dreamed that the bid would rise so high and we would have reached 2.5 million euros. This is a dream come true” now well that indeed is a dream come true 3 million dollars for one night of action with a stranger is a very tempting idea indeed.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Well in this day and age of course the word prostitution has been stigmatized and Giselle also likes to think of her actions as being liberating for women as opposed to demeaning and downright immoral. She claims to be shocked at public reaction to her money making endeavor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If I want to spend my first time with someone who is not my first love, that’s my decision,” the model has said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is not the first time that Cinderella Escorts has managed sell overpriced female virginity however. Last year the website made headlines when it auctioned off the virginity of the then 18 year old Alexandra Kefren, a young and ambitious Romanian model. The winning bid? A handsome 2 million British pounds. The buyer was a businessman from Hong Kong whose name has also never been publically revealed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The website is owned by a 27 year old man from the city of Dortmund, Germany.   Jan Zakobielski who owns the escort website has said that takes 20 percent of the total. In his defense he says that he double checks to make sure that the person is old and mature enough to understand what they are getting themselves into and that he does not accept anybody who is not in the best of psychological health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Modern day sexologists are understandably not too happy with such arrangements. “Virginity auctions are outdated and antiquated,” one sexologist told Vice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“On our website you will find a video where girls from all over the world talk about the reasons to sell their virginity. Girls from Australia, Europe, Africa, North and South America. From Arab countries and Asian,” a spokesman for Cinderella escorts told the media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This shows us that the desire to auction a virginity is no exception.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“And on the other hand, the high bidding for Giselle’s auction shows us how high the demand for virgins is. Business people from all over the world have been bidding.”&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;While people should be free to do as they like with their bodies such markets for buying sex are very demeaning to women and are an insult to women everywhere. While there might be great demand for virginity it is a moral outrage that such things are being legally allowed in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Model Sells Her Virginity for Three Million Dollars","description":"Nineteen year old American model decided to sell her virginity which was sold in an online auction for an astounding sum of 2.5 million euros to an obviously wealthy yet unnamed businessman from the United Arab Emirates."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/f/9fc17e35fb0b4d8ed2b0c260932ce1cf_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/f/ac9ce1dc3cdc94d1e492be3675c4501f_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Boy Rips Off 15-Year-Old Girl’S Bra – Then Mother Sees Back And Takes Her Brilliant Revenge"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/f/91364de2966deb2bb3a862edbb09533f_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Fascinating Fashion Tips from the Ancient World"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
