However if we really think about it, mostly we just come up with suggestions off the top of our head. We do not give it much thought and without realizing give them a pretty vague and inadequate advice. We might give them an advice based on our own experience. Completely disregarding the fact that the circumstances and situations may be different for our friend. Other times we come up with advice which may appear to us as more favorable yet we do not know the ensuing consequences. Sometimes we may even tell them a blatant lie because in our perception they may not be able to handle the truth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whatever the case maybe we always have the best intentions to help. The fact that sometimes those well-meaning tips may actually turn out to be quite disastrous is a possibility. The fallout of those advices may even affect your friendship. So be on your guard and avoid giving your friend following advice under any circumstances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. “Give that person more time to prove themselves”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2006.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock  &lt;p&gt;We often do not grasp the severity of the situation and in our bid to not take things towards some uncomfortable confrontations we suggest our friends to remain passive. For example we have two friends who are going out together. We like them both and wish them to stay together so we could enjoy double date with them. Now your guy friend made your friend wait and did not show up at all for the evening. He ignored the calls and messages of your friend as well. In this scenario you do not want any confrontations and want to resolve the conflict come what may. This mentality of making your friend accept the unfair treatment and telling them to give him another chance is wrong on your part. You should have made your friend felt they are in the right to be disappointed about the situation. If they face similar situation again your friend will stop taking your advice and rightly so. You are too soft and not understanding at all of their grievances to the point that you give very inaccurate advice. They will simply stop listening to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. “Act indifferent and hard to get”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2007.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock  &lt;p&gt;You see your girlfriend positively blushing with excitement about her interest in a guy. She really wants to make headway for a conversation with him to open up other possibilities. She is so excited that you are starting to get a little bit annoyed by their bursting enthusiasm. You simply tell them to contain their energy and compose themselves. Things like guys do not go for girls who appear a little too available so instead you tell them to stay cool and act aloof.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the worst possible advice in such a scenario. Guys do not have psychic powers to be able to play such mind games. They will only tell if you are interested in them if you are forthcoming about it. If they feel you are cold shouldering them they will naturally move to someone else who will be vibrant about conveying their feelings. Instead of telling them to play hard to get you should help them calm their nerves and boost their self-confidence so they could be ready for their date with the person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. “Stop being so demanding”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2008.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock  &lt;p&gt;You are nicely settled in a relationship and you want your girlfriend to settle down as well. You want her to find someone soon and in your haste you grow impatient about her so many demands and her ideals that you start to lecture them about not being so picky. Hey, it is their life and their choice and opinion. Why do you feel you should have the final say on their important matters of life? You may end up giving them advice that is not resonant with their wishes and they might grow weary of your opinion. Your impatience will also start to show as you impose your wishes on them. Instead of forcing them to settle down give them their space and time to think over their decision. Then support them relentlessly whoever they finally decide to settle down with.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;6. Just give your best and do not think about failing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2009.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock  &lt;p&gt;Well obviously a person is trying their best to make something work. Especially if it is close to their heart and appeal their interest. But telling them not to worry about failure is like making them completely oblivious to the consequences. It may make them blind to the end result and help them focus on the task at hand but keeping the bigger picture in your head while going about your task is very important. What if your friend is not handled to face the failure tomorrow? They might pin the blame on you as well and rightly so because you made them numb to the possibility of such an outcome. It is nice to be supportive but make your friend prepared for the worst case scenario, as they say “hope for the best but prepare for the worst”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Money and finances are not that important&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2011.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock  &lt;p&gt;This could only be said by those who could have stable financial background. A common man will always think of money as an important part of the equation in everything. Be it relationships, personal life or any other facet of life. If you do not have a fridge full of supplies and bills which are still pending and someone tell you that money is insignificant in the grand scheme of things you will naturally lose your cool. It is true that money is not everything but if your friend is facing some difficult financial situation you ought to stay realistic and validate their worries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. “Buy it already!”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2013.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock  &lt;p&gt;You are roaming in the mall looking for that perfect pair of shoes and your friend does not seem to settle for any pair. You are going into shop after shop and they are still not satisfied. You start to grow impatient and in your haste you make them buy the next pair they are trying on. Your friend might sense your impatience and may delay her decision or act on your advice to buy them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The better thing you could have done in this situation was to make them shop at their pace and try to indulge your own self in some activity to manage to pass time instead of waiting on them to finalize their purchase. Your urgency and impatience might make them regret their final purchase as they did it because you forced them in a way. You could also have told them to take it easy just step back and relax. If they cannot seem to decide now they can go home and sleep over it and come back tomorrow to make the purchase. This will be a much nicer gesture on your part and also make you free of the blame that comes with the post purchase regret.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Just break your shackles and have freedom to a happier you&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2015.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock  &lt;p&gt;Stop oversimplifying things to the point that other person may feel like you do not even relate to them in anyway. We sometimes feel very low for certain reasons and we need that helping hand or a friend to pick us up and make us feel positive. However this does not mean to go and tell your friend to just be happy. Like they were wallowing in self-pity and being miserable and we telling them to be happy will suddenly make them come out of their anxiety or depression. We need to spend our time with them and try to actually listen to their problems instead of stating such useless and generic advices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Let bygones be bygones&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2017.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock  &lt;p&gt;No, do not advise them on forgetting their past. Rather make them forget about their mistakes they made in their past but make them learn from their experience. Forgetting what went wrong or trying to suppress the past will only make those troubles of the past to repeat again in some manner in the future. Provide them the support and help them heal from their past mistakes but at the same time make them learn what went wrong. This will make them better prepared for the future and will enable them to handle the situation better drawing help from their past experiences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. “These look just fine on you”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-2019.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock      &lt;p&gt;We are always careful not to hurt the feelings of our friend to the point that we tell little white lies in order to avoid hurting their sensitivities. They might be trying out different clothes and asking us if the clothes fit them fine. It is clearly visible that they are trying on size a little too tight for them but instead of giving them an honest feedback we tell them that it looks just fine. We should be sincere and state what seems right to us instead of being inaccurate as we will be doing more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"9 of the Worst Tips We've All Given Our Friends","description":"Most useless, generic and impractical tips you could advocate"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/f/8c2d096e9e91bb828b38f523493ad37f_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/f/91364de2966deb2bb3a862edbb09533f_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Fascinating Fashion Tips from the Ancient World"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/f/814f83965cb2fc95e0b40f4a54aaeebf_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Things You CAN Do That Amish Women CAN'T"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
