A few decades ago, obesity was an issue confronted by only a few of the unfortunate people, mostly the aged ones. But today, from a 4 year old toddler to a 50-year old man, all are grappling with the same misery, i.e. how to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Weight gain is not just about looking fat and ugly, rather it is about getting deprived from living a decent quality of life. It is about dealing with high blood pressure issues, becoming a patient of Diabetes or God forbids, suffering from cardiac failure. It is for this reason that Bariatric surgery is getting heightened attention form the medical experts and is being increasingly recommended to obese patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1620.jpeg&quot;/&gt;hormone.org &lt;p&gt;However, it’s not that one day you wake up and realize that you have gained an extra few pounds so you walk up to the doctor’s door thinking for having the surgery in mind. Weight-losing is not a matter that should be taken lightly, and hence not everyone can qualify for it. This type of surgery can only be opted by those who can meet a pre-specified criteria; i.e. having a BMI (Body Mass Index) exceeding 25. For people having a BMI of more than 40, it is inevitable for them to have this surgery as soon as possible, while people falling in the BMI bracket of 35-40 should be facing some other health risk as well to getting this surgery approved for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if you are thinking that Bariatric surgery is a magical panacea that will get you put of the weight-gain menace in moments, then let me burst your bubble. It’s not just getting it written on your medical prescription that the patient is advised Bariatric surgery. On an individual’s part, it is a huge decision making process based on the health issues and the results that he wants from the surgery. After all, that extra fat that you must have relished eating in the past, is not just going to evaporate in the operation theatre. It’s going to be a game involving knives and a lot of searing instruments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So below are some of the options mentioned for your aid, on which you can thoroughly ponder over, before deciding with which one to go.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Gastric Bypass&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1621.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;This is one of the most prevalent type of Bariatric surgery in which a small pouch is created within the patient, and that pouch is the only recipient of food for that individual. This limits the amount of food intake that the person can do following the surgery, since the size of that ‘new stomach’ is small, thus curbing your appetite.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The small intestine is then relinked to this newly created pouch and now the food goes into it, bypassing a major portion of the small intestine. This way reduces calorie absorption, leading got further weight-loss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This procedure is recommended to those who have fallen prey to diabetes and acid reflux. The bypassing of food from the old portion of the intestine to the new one greatly affects insulin levels in a positive way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, this type of surgery is not apt for people susceptible to cardiac diseases since the duration of the surgery is longer, putting the patient at a huge risk for a lengthy time period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sleeve Gastrectomy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1622.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Imgur&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This procedure results in the major part of your stomach getting detached from the body while the remaining one is deformed into a banana shaped tube. This physical decrease in the stomach size ultimately reduces the amount of food intake as well as the desire to eat, owing to the minimal production of the hormone ‘ghrelin’ that is an indicator of hunger. However, the calories absorption level remains non-chalant with this technique.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;People suffering from serious acid reflux problem are severely advised not to undergo this type of surgery. Owing to the reduction in stomach size, around 20% of the people who have experienced such a surgery have faced worsening acid reflux problems. Although there are a few cases where this problem was eliminated once the surgery was conducted, the chances for betterment are minimal and the risk is real.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Relative to the bypass, sleeve is a simple method, but a very risky one. If the whole made in the stomach isn’t sealed up properly, there is a threat of the contents leaking down in the abdomen, resulting in major infectious diseases for the patient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Adjustable gastric band&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1623.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;This procedure contains an inflatable balloon that is fixed on the upper part of the stomach and creates a very narrow opening for the food to pass down into the stomach. In this way people tend to feel full a bit sooner that results in loss of obesity. However, the calories absorption level remains the same, as with the sleeve technique.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This banding technique qualifies for people falling under the category of BMI between 30 – 35 and who are willing to commit consulting the doctor frequently. This is because the band needs readjusting often so you will have to make quite a lot of visits during the initial phase, following the surgery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This method might look as the safest and the simples, but it must not be forgotten that it doesn’t promise long lasting results, since the opening of the balloon might get too narrow resulting in stomach aches. So 10 years down the road, you might get crestfallen seeing yourself as the same fat person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1624.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Encyclopedia.nm.org &lt;p&gt;The BPD/DS method is the most lengthy and complex of all owing got the fact that it involves two surgeries within one. AS with the sleeve procedure, the stomach is shaped into a tube. The small intestine is then reconnected with the stomach in such a way that doesn’t let food pass through the major portion of this intestine. This bypassing of food is actually referred to as Biliopancreatic diversion and this results in reduced nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The chances of successful weight-loss are the highest post this surgery and it almost guarantees cure for diabetic people. However, post medical check-up is a must in this case to monitor the nutritional level strictly, since cases have been reported where the individual started enduring the complication of protein deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because this surgery poses a bit of a challenge for the doctors, it is not conducted oft-times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Gastric balloon&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1625.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;This balloon is inserted down the throat and it covers up the stomach area reducing the urge and appetite to eat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This surgery if for people who want to get slim within a tight time frame. Also, doctors undertaking a knee or a ‘similar injury are unable to operate properly because the person’s increased obesity would result in multiple problems. Hence, this gastric balloon serves as a remedy in such scenarios.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It must be remembered that this surgery will offer solution for a transient period of time.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;You would think after these surgeries that the worst part is over, but trust me it’s not. Your difficult situation is just about to onset. Because now, you are obligated to commit with yourself not to adopt reckless eating habits. Following the surgery, it is significant that your diet and appetite is thoroughly controlled, so as to reap the benefits of the misery that you sustained.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"5 Types Of Weight-Loss Surgery You Need To Know About","description":"Weigh-loss surgery options.
