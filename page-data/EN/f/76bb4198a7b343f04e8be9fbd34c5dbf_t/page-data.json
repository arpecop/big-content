This world is full of crazy things and whether you agree or disagree, there’s a lot of underground activity that you and I do not know about. Lurking in the darkness of the shadows of this world are secret societies that are controlled by a few of the most powerful people on the planet. These societies have been around for centuries. They comprise of revolutionists, leaders, politicians, statesmen, actors and the list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’ll be surprised to find influential politicians appearing to be saving the world in the day and mysteriously brewing the seeds of anarchy in the night, without you even having the slightest of clue. Whenever a story pops up about theses secretive groups, it is normally brushed aside as nothing more than a conspiracy theory. But to those conspiracy theorists, it is much more than that. Think about it, why would anyone waste their time thinking about something as unrealistic as this?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, the answer is because it might not be unrealistic. These conspiracy theorists travel down memory lane into the depths of history to connect the dots that everyone else has missed. They have a hunch and grab onto it. Over the past decade, they’ve been pretty successful in shining some light on these untold stories. They’ve crafted out their own perspectives that force you to think again. We’ve come up with a list of the most ‘top secret’ societies that, in one way or another, shaped the world that we live in today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10) The Bohemian Grove&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-901.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Information Liberation  &lt;p&gt;Originally, Bohemian Grove is a 2700 acre located at 20601 Bohemian Avenue in Monte Rio, California. But that’s what they want people to know. The Bohemian Grove is essentially a society that has had tremendous influence over US politics over the years. Since 1923, every single Republican President has been said to be a member of the Bohemian Grove, with leaders like Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon among the ranks. It is a place situated in the forests of California where the rich and powerful get together to drink beer, urinate in public and pay homage to a giant forty foot owl. And that’s no joke. Even though their slogan “weaving spiders come not here” implies that the purpose of this group is to socialise, there are always business deals and political meetings going on under the table. In fact in 1942 Grove members held a meeting concerning the controversial Manhattan Project, exactly three years before the atomic bomb was created in the US.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9) The Black Hand&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-902.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikimedia &lt;p&gt;Founded in 1911, it was meant to be a unifying force for all the people of Serbia living in Europe. In the Kingdom of Serbia a bunch of military officials joint forces to conjure up a single nation for all Serbian-Europeans. The founders of the society actually toppled the King of Serbia in 1903 in order to place someone of their own liking on the throne. Their mission was however halted by the resolute Austro-Hungary Empire. As most of the Serbians lived under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Emperor, they decide to come up with a plan. In 1914, they hatched a plan to assassinate Franz Ferdinand – the heir to the Empire. Even though they accomplished their goal of assassinating the heir, they could not have predicted what was to follow. The assassination didn’t sit well with the Austro-Hungarian people as they declared war on Serbia. This caused a spill-over effect that lead to the unfortunately famous World War 2 where 18 million people were killed including the leaders of the black hand. Some say, they’re also responsible for the birth of one German moustached dictator known as Hitler.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8) Afrikaner Broederbond&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-903.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Sahistory.org &lt;p&gt;From 1918 onwards this group exerted colossal power and influence from behind the scenes in South Africa. It was initially intended to promote Afrikaaner nationalism – the desire to create a common identity for all white Africans. This coincidentally matched the ethos of the popular national party at the time. And eventually the national party turned into nothing more than the secret Afrikaaner Broederbond operating in public. This secret group had risen to power and practically gained complete control of the African Bureau of Racial Affairs in 1947. They did not pursue noble intentions and put into motion the concept of apartheid, a system of racial segregation that lasted for more than 50 years. Fortunately, the national party dissolved the apartheid movement in 1990 and hence Afrikaner Broederbond turned into Afrikaner Bond motivated to work towards make a better South Africa for everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7) The Club of Rome&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-904.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;After years of confidential meetings, the club of Rome came up with a published report entitled ‘Limits to Growth’ in 1972. It was a captivating read based on the concept that our planet would not be able to withstand the full length of humanity beyond the 21st century, meaning thereby that we humans would run the earth into the ground. This report sold 30 million copies and is still the best-selling environmental book that ever roamed the face of the earth. This international society was founded in 1968 by Italian businessman Aurelio Peccei and Scottish scientist Alexander King. They made sure that the society would be kept a secret by making it extremely exclusive and allowing only a maximum of 100 members. This group of 100 men were entitled to work towards building a better, safer and sustainable world. Surprise, surprise! Not all societies are meant to be evil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6) Opus Dei&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-905.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikimedia &lt;p&gt;Famously known as the bad guys in the Da Vinci Code, it was founded in Spain by JoseMaria Escriva in 1928. It was originally meant to promote the ideology that all people living an ordinary life can be holy. The group comprises of more than 94000 members as of today, out of which 20% are proclaimed to be ‘numeraries’. These numeraries live in centres controlled by the Opus Dei and are supposed to live with members of the Opus Dei only. It is believed that the organisation had strict rules of control for its members such as telling them what they’re allowed to watch on TV, who they’re allowed to talk to and where they’re allowed to go. It’s difficult to imagine how much power they wield exactly because they don’t enlist their members. But a former UK minister, a senator in Italy and a Chilean presidential nominee are all known to be members. I think when it comes to power and influence, they’ve got the right strategy.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;5) Skull and Bones&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-906.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Infowars &lt;p&gt;Initiated by a Yale university student known as William H. Russel in 1832, this has to be one of the most sinister names for a secret group of anarchists. Every year, he selected fifteen men and women of the junior class who were deemed as candidates with the potential to achieve power and success in the future. They would congregate in halls also called tombs. The listings of the members were not kept a secret but the meetings and practices were. The alumni of the society have gone on to achieve a disproportionately large number of positions of power. So much so that the 2004 US presidential candidates of the Republican (George W. Bush) and Democratic (John Kerry) parties were both members. There’s a rumor going around that they were the ones who constructed the CIA, but we can’t quantify how much power they actually possess.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4) Freemasons&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-907.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;What links Shacquille O Neal, Steve Wozniack and Winston Churchill? They were all freemasons. Since the first grand masonic lodge in London 1717, the male dominated society of freemasons has been immensely popular. Today they have over six million members that share secret passwords and rituals for example being blindfolded with a rope around your neck in front of other men..sounds interesting. The freemasons supposedly built the pyramids, caused the French Revolution and are of course plotting world domination. Lots of conspiracy theories surround these extremely under cover group of men. The most notable occasion where the secret was almost uncovered was when the titanic crashed with only 20 lifeboats on board whereas there were 2220 passengers. The judge and the leading members of the board of trade in the UK covered it up because..wait for it.. they were freemasons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3) The Circle&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-908.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutter Stock &lt;p&gt;A group founded in the 1950s by former French prime minister Antoine Pinay, The Circle was intended to unite all of the sovereign European forces after the World War 2. It consisted of statesmen, intelligence officers and top military officials from former warring rivals like France and Germany. Since there hasn’t been another world war since then, it seems like they succeeded in their mission. But that’s not the only thing they’re famous for. The group has been known to conspire against right-wing groups in favor of the left. They’ve had to deal with a fair share of accusations regarding assassinations of high-profile politicians like the Swedish prime minister in 1986. And if that wasn’t enough they’re said to be funded by the CIA, of all the agencies. Conspiracy theory? You decide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2) The Bilderberg Group&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-909.jpeg&quot;/&gt;we are change &lt;p&gt;Every year since 1954, approximately 120 to 150 members of the European and North American elite have congregated for a top secret conference. Attendees of this conference are typically bankers, politicians and executives of large businesses including all your favourite names such as IBM, Goggle, Shell, Coca Cola, Nestle, Vodafone, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and so on. Heads of states such as former Spanish King Juan Carlos and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have also followed suit and joined in. When the group was originally founded by exiled Polish politician Jozef Retinger, its main aim was to establish a concrete and stable relationship between Western Europe and the United States of America. But that’s not all that they wanted. World renowned professors like Andrew Kakabadse have gone on record saying their main objective now is ‘to bolster a consensus around free market Western capitalism and its interests around the globe. They influenced the election of Van Rompoy as president of the European Council in 2009 as well. They get what they want.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1) Propaganda Due&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-910.jpeg&quot;/&gt;zr.org &lt;p&gt;Propaganda Due or P2 for short, are probably the most suspicious and villainous  underworld societies that exist today. They started off as a Masonic lodge in Italy in 1945 but these guys were so outrageously crazy that they were kicked out by the freemasons in 1976. Its members include every single head of the Italian intelligence agency, future prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, son of the last King of Italy and the editor of the country’s biggest newspaper. P2 was so powerful that it was considered a shadow government and it drew up plans for controlling the media, rewriting the Italian constitution and getting rid of trade unions. They were even linked to the collapse of one of Italy’s biggest banks, Banco Ambrosiano and the murder of its chairman Roberto Calvi in 1982. The Italian police were vigilant enough and caught on to the list of P2 members eventually leading to their demise.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;I’m guessing you’re sitting there, staring at the screen and wondering what the hell did I just read. Do I believe it or not? Well, to be honest I would react the exact same way. At the end of the day it’s all about what you think is right. I tried to shed some light on the underlying mysteries that exist in the modern day. These societies have been a huge part of the framework of the new world order. Their roots are submerged deep into our history. Over the years since the birth and rebirth of technology the common man is exposed to a lot of information. This information has played a huge role in the discovery of these precariously top secret societies. It’s funny how we choose not to believe certain things in fear of the truth. But the sooner we accept these theories as truths, the more we will know. I advise you to do your own research and then come up with your own conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Secret Societies That Supposedly Control the World","description":"A list of groups who are secretly calling the shots"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/f/76bb4198a7b343f04e8be9fbd34c5dbf_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/f/770b0602d6b66412ce277bd376301e0f_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"8 Most Deadliest Amazon Rain forest Animals"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/f/73b494aee0b268a9e2928e42e1ab799f_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Most Shocking On-Stage Moments"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
