But who would have thought that an engineer, who previously worked for NASA, will make this kind of a discovery and make science as entertaining as any other thing. The funny part is that while recording the whole process, Mark Rober explained the whole thing while playing in a hot bath tub filled with the sand cum liquid soap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Explaining the whole process:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mark mentioned the name “fluidized bed”, which is the name given to the phenomenon on which he is working. The complete process or experiment revolves around a solid (sand in this case) acting like a liquid. One of the main characteristics of liquids are bubbling and flowing in the container where the are kept. Mark induced the abovementioned characteristics in sand. The main agent behind sand to ripple and bubble like a liquid is non other that air. During the experiment, Mark blew air from the bottom of the container which caused the individual sand particle to push each other apart from each other. The pushing apart of the particles reduced the friction and the molecular forces; hence allowing the sand particles to move freely like water molecules.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/c-users-mahad-downloads-5-12-3167-02-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;mshcdn.com &lt;h2&gt;What Mark Rober had to say about his discovery:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ve wanted to build one for a long time,” Mark explains in his video. “But you can find literally NO information online on how to make one like that. So I started combing through a bunch of patent drawings for massive industrial-sized fluid beds, and I noticed that instead of one big inlet, they all had a bunch of small holes to deliver air.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What difficulties Mark went through:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mark told this in his video that he failed several time (25 times to be more precise) before reaching the end result i.e. fluidized sand. One of the main reasons behind his continuous failure was that there was no online illustrations that could help him build all this in the first go. The only help he had was the industrial set up of some factories, which use the same concept to function their operations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How to set this up yourself:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mark explained that he simplified the whole set up in order to make it easy for others to follow. In the place of using one large air inlet, he told that it is ideal to use several small holes to blow air into the tub full of sand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Building this set up requires you to take 3-4 plastic pipes and drill several alternate holes, 90 degrees apart from each other. Now connect the pipes together and make sure that the holes are faced downwards to avoid the sand from flowing into the cavity. Fix this ladder shaped pipelined structure in the bottom of a container with hot glue. Let the glue dry, and fill the container with grains of sand. Connect the pipes with an air compressor, from where you can blow air into the system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The funny side of this video:&lt;/h2&gt;     &lt;p&gt;You can see Mark playing with his nephews, throwing balls in the sand tub. Spooning the sand. Letting the football to float on the surface frictionless-ly. The only thing that allows him to do all this is science.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Ex NASA Engineer Makes Everyone Freak out When He Turns Sand into 'Liquid Soup', and Here's How He Did It","description":"Do you think that sand is a solid substance?
