Instead, we see things are we are. Those of us reading this who walk around with a personal raincloud over their head can probably relate. It makes sense to be anxious and afraid. It makes sense to overthink things, especially some certain sensitive matters that can only be assessed subjectively. Anxiety, you see, is a built-in mechanism all us humans have. When the fight or flight acid kicks in, we’re often in a flabbergasted state of confusion as to how even the simplest of tasks will get done. Unfortunately, it’s not all good news and sunshine or rainbows. Sometimes, these thoughts that the anxiousness births become common. And if not addressed or if kept bottled up, for too long, this might lead you to develop a chronically negative state of mind. These toxic thoughts have been known for taking lives! Don’t worry though – as always, we’re here to help. Think you’re a victim of what we just read through? Here’s how to address these toxic thoughts and hopefully fix them. Forever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Know the difference&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-343.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;How will I save the money to pay this month’s rent? Will I actually pass that math test, I knew I had three questions wrong! I have a flight in five hours God I hope all this stuff fits in my suitcase! Any of these sound even remotely familiar? Well, the deal is, there is a stark difference between being anxious to the extent of developing a disorder and actually worrying. Worrying is acceptable and considering how it’s just human nature, it would be wrong to say that worrying does you bad. Take it as a sign of your body’s defense mechanism acting up. Think of it as your body’s smoke detector which is a staunch believer in the fact that where there is smoke, there is fire. Completely normal! When is it bad though? This is when it becomes a subconscious habit of yours. When worrying becomes a chronic disease of the mind is when you’re stressing out about every single thing under the sun – constantly. This is never a good thing. According to a recent study, the average person spends around 55 minutes of the day just worrying. A person with such an issue as we just described however, has been studied to have spent around 300 minutes of the day just worrying. If you want to gain the upper hand on toxic thoughts, record how long you were anxious for today! The results might surprise you!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Make it even clearer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-344.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;I don’t even know if my car will be safe in that overcrowded parking lot. I am so sure I’m going to lose my keys! Man I swear this assignment will be the death of my GPA, I just can’t do that stupid chapter! Any of this ring a bell? Well here’s the thing. You need to make sure you clearly know if you’re worried or in this case, plain scared! American President Theodore Roosevelt said the only thing to fear, is fear itself. Talk about an inspirational quote! Bring yourself to terms with the basic fact that fear of the unknown is one of the worst and most helpless situations you can find yourself in, and that it is completely fine to be in such a situation! Not everyone knows everything and not everyone can know everything. If it’s fear you’re feeling, know that just like worrying, this is normal too. A natural response from the human body, this is again an example of the fight or flight kicking in. Know fear is not the relative enemy. Being too anxious for too long on the other hand, definitely is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Find the light&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-345.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;I can’t believe I forgot my camping flashlight back home. Oh well, I guess I’ll have a starlit night tonight. I hate myself for forgetting that dinner plan with the boys tonight! Ah, at least I still have my parents’ company. Oh God, I think I forgot my lipstick on the dresser! I needed it to freshen up before the meeting! I guess I’ll stop at Sephora on the way, maybe that shade wasn’t too good anyways. Right now, you might be smiling saying no way does this ever happen. Who accepts their mistake and if not, who accepts fate and tries to find the good in adversity? Well, you’re in for a surprise because according to a lot of happy people, the secret is just that. Instead of accepting defeat and feeling helpless, learn to find the best out of the situation. Ask yourself – what can I learn from this? What’s one thing I can do differently next time to save me from having this as the outcome? Instead of feeling bad, use that time to think these things. We guarantee you’ll feel better!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;People don’t really matter!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-346.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;I knew I shouldn’t have worn those flip-flops and shorts to the store, she saw me! I bet she’ll tell the other classmates. I really wish my brother hadn’t taken the car to work today! Guess I’ll call a cab and get out a few blocks away from the office building. They better not see me coming out of a cab! Pimple right on the forehead, couldn’t it have been any other day? God, what will everyone think of me at the dinner? These thoughts are common, unwelcome and very unpleasant. If you experience a lot of these more often than not, you might be a victim of a chronically toxic mental element. This is easily remedied if you put your mind to it though. Make sure you understand the concept that people just never matter! No one has the time, attention, priority or energy to commit one seemingly embarrassing thing you did, which might on retrospect, not even be half as bad! Everyone has their own commitments and things to do. No one thinks about something minimal and irrelevant except yourself, since it hurt you the most. As a matter of fact, if anything negative at all, people actually fear what you think about them! The sooner you realize this the better, and you will feel free!&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;Ask yourself&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-347.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Have you ever craved big bowl of pasta and gone through the trouble of getting it out of the fridge, plating up, warming it in the microwave and seating down with a glass of nice cold Coke only to find out you’re not too hungry anymore? Chances are, you confused hunger with boredom! More often than not, we confuse hunger with thirst as well. Just like that, sometimes we’re just not sure what this emotion is. When the negative thought comes knocking at your door the next time, question it before you let it in! Ask yourself. Is this fear even real or is it just triggered when I visit this place due to a previous bad experience? Is this feeling genuine? Am I actually confused and helpless or can I think of a way out of this? You’ll be happy to know when you question this thought instead of directly letting it in, it’ll actually go away. Stop yourself from taking a potentially dangerous step! Think about it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Replace, remove, relieve&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-348.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Every time I walk by this bench in the park, I’m reminded of that time that old homeless woman who used to sit here and feed the pigeons. Every time I watch this channel, I’m reminded of the horrid accident it was once showing because of which I’m afraid to drive now. Each time I see that vase at the office lobby, I’m reminded of the one time I accidentally knocked over that Mother of Pearls ancient peace as a kid and my father had to pay hundreds of thousands for recovery. All these, dear readers, are known as triggers. Anything can trigger anyone, any time. There’s no criteria or time when it will happen. All you need to do is approach it. Knowingly or unknowingly, and you’re already damaged for the day. Again, this is very common and different people have different attachments. Some people don’t fear what drives you insane, but the thing is, it’s all okay! Learn to replace those memories with new ones. So what if that old lady isn’t in her place anymore? Why does it have to be that she passed away? Perhaps someone took her in for good home! The pigeons didn’t leave! Maybe she still visits at times! Learn, more, to remove things. Don’t flip to that channel. You can easily avoid it. This is made even easier by acknowledgement of the fact that you know it’ll hurt. It’s not unprecedented. Don’t stay on this channel for longer than a minute! If you can’t remove it, like the vase example, you can always change your route! Learn to accept that what you broke in your childhood is now in your past and you never did it on purpose. Learn that you shouldn’t venture too close to it and that you can always use the other entrance to your office cubicle. Bypass it and you’re all set! Day made? We thought so too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Read, write, listen&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-349.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock  &lt;p&gt;A lot of the times you may have realized that there may be this one rock song that just takes you away to someplace else. All your worries and troubles just fade and in that moment, you are invincible. But wait a second – you don’t even like rock! This is the power of auditory stimulation. The power to take you elsewhere, with your general taste such as, in music, not even playing a minimal role. This extends to reading and writing as well. For some people, a comfy corner of the room, a mug of coffee at the right temperature and a good read are their portal into someplace far, safe and Utopian. For others, writing soothes the soul. Some people just like to type out the pains and worries of the day and maybe never even intend to publish it. Just a memoir for a faded memory. This is different for everyone of course, and you’ve got to find your thing. What takes you away from the toxic memories? Is it that guitar solo from that rock ballad or is it the way that certain author writes? Either way, know you’re never alone and you’ll find others like you too. Spend some time in the comments or reviews section and you’ll find out!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Walk it out&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-350.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Let’s all take a break and take a deep breathe in, and out. Let’s repeat, but much slower, and with our eyes closed. Aah, feels refreshing doesn’t it? Well, you see, it’s common of us to believe that since thoughts arise in the mind, that’s where they are formed as well. This couldn’t be further away from the truth! Sometimes, the reason we’re having these bad thoughts is simply because of the environment. All we need is a breath of fresh air and a change of surroundings. You’ll be all set in a jiffy. What’s the best way to do this? Walk it out! Aerobic exercise is all, altogether, very beneficial for you if you’re stressed and need a breather. The next time you feel too blue, walk it out!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Talk about it&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-351.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;“I’m so glad we had this talk!”, this is a sentence you must have heard a million if not a billion times in your life already. Be it movies, cartoons, books or anywhere else, the power of dialogue and that too – constructive, is always appreciated. The thing about talking something out is that only does it make you feel lighter but also helps you soothe yourself with the feeling that your friend/significant other who you’ve poured your heart out to understands your situation and is now on board your mental train. Everyone always wants to help. It’s just that sometimes, you don’t want to open up. For situations like so, we say talk! You’ll be glad you had this talk!&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;We hope these points help you keep negative and toxic thoughts in check for you. Find them helpful? Try them out. Let us know!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"A Mini Manual for Keeping Those Toxic and Negative Thoughts Under Control!","description":"Negative and toxic thinking is a killer which slowly ruins your life -one day at a time.
