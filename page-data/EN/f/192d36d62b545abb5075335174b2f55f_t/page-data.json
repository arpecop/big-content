School and college teach us a lot, but there are several weird and interesting facts that many still might not know of. If we can get to know even a few of these, we’d probably be smarter for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order to get you on the smart track, we’ve compiled a large number of interesting facts. Some additional details make them even more mind-blowing! Read on to get smarter and more knowledgeable in just a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;31. TV Static has a History&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-742.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The modern world seems very far removed from the one we had just a few decades ago. However, everything we see must have some connection to the past. In many cases, these connections go quite a bit deeper than expected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take, for instance, TV static. We’ve all grown up with television sets, and there’s nothing more frustrating or familiar than the black-and-white dots. This little-known fact may make it a bit more interesting, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It turns out that TV static actually contains a bit of radiation from none other than the Big Bang itself. Not the TV show, but the actual ‘bang’ that propelled the universe into being. Religious factors aside, it’s pretty cool that we get to see a little piece of our beginning in our TC screen!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;30. The Intelligent Peoples&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-743.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;If anyone has studied even a little bit of etymology, they would know how words have changed over the years. The languages we now use today are derived from Latin, Greek, Arabic, and a number of other tongues. Some of these old languages are ‘dead’, as we can say of Latin. However, we can bet you can’t really imagine where languages really originated from.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It turns out that quite a number of ancient folks came up with their language on their own! Of course, civilizations would need a better way to communicate than just signs and grunt! Hence, the brilliant minds of the Egyptians, Chinese, Mayans, Sumerians, and Harappans each came up with their own language. This was probably an independent effort, as they had little precedent to go on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;29. Our Breathing Patterns&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-744.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;We’re all breathing without thinking about it, if we’re lucky. However, a stuffy nose may make us think more about how to breathe comfortably. Still, many of us don’t know that on a usual day, we’re actually breathing in more air through one nostril. The other nostril may be unblocked, but it’s sort of taking a rest for a little bit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s even more interesting is that the nostrils change this pattern every four hours! It’s almost like they’re taking work shifts. Whatever the case is, we sure appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;28. The Miracle of Sunlight&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-745.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Ah, sunlight. We need it for our Vitamin D, natural light needs, and just about everything else. On the other hand, we apply sunscreen, wear sunglasses, and generally try to escape it as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sunlight is composed of photons, which have a very strange behavior. More specifically, the strangeness lies in their speed. They travel from the core of the sun to its surface and then travel to us on earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, a photon can take upward of frothy thousand years to get from the sun’s core to its surface! On the other hand, it takes a grand total of eight minutes to reach the earth from the sun. we’re very grateful for this speed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;27. You can Relax About Your Eyeballs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-746.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;When you hear any weird fact, it’s always best to check up on it. Take, for instance, the myth about your eyeballs popping out if you don’t close your eyes while sneezing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In reality, your eyeballs are pretty firmly set in place. Cartoons may show us otherwise, but it’s very hard to have your eyeballs pop out. you probably still shouldn’t try to stop a sneeze though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for closing the eyes while sneezing, that’s more of a reflex than anything else. After all, you’re giving your whole body a jerk and expelling germs. If you do happen to keep your eyes open during a sneeze, there’s probably no reason to panic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;26. Cadavers Acting Spooky&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-747.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Cadavers, or dead bodies, are spooky things by themselves. the soul is gone; what’s left is a cold and lifeless thing that is better off buried as soon as possible. however, the body has several spooky ways of showing us that it once had life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One way in which bodies do this is to have the hair (and sometimes nails) growing after the spirit has fled. This is somewhat understandable, as hair and nails don’t require blood pumping through the veins. They grow out a little due to their natural process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, some dead bodies have even been known to get goosebumps. This is probably even weirder than the hair thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;25. A Very Serious Question Answered&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-748.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever been disturbed by mosquitoes, you may have worried about losing all your blood to those little suckers. Worry not, though. It would take around one million and two hundred thousand mosquitoes to drain a human being.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;24. Hot Sand is Miraculous&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-749.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Glass is a natural material, made from none other than plain old sand. This is made possible by literally melting sand at a temperature of 3090 Fahrenheit. When the melted sand cools down, it becomes glass. If this isn’t a wondrous fact, we don’t know what is!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;23. Boiling Water, Underwater&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-750.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;A tiny thing like the mantis shrimp can actually boil the water around it! It does this by moving its claws very, very rapidly. In fact, this movement is actually quick enough to produce a small flash of light at the same time. any way we can harness that as an alternative energy source?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;22. The Millennial Syndrome&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-751.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Millenials are what we term the young generation in their twenties and below. These are the people who grew up with social media or are very comfortable with it. They are hence most likely to post their complaints on their social media profiles too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, complaining about social media may be a red flag for many. It is now known that those who post their problems or complaints online are at risk of suffering from depression. They are also more likely to suffer from anxiety or stress at the same time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;21. The Shocking News About Sushi&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-752.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;It’s all right, you can still enjoy sushi. However, you may want to stop calling it a traditional Japanese dish. Turns out, it actually originated in Southeast Asia! So yes, you may want to try it out with a bit of curry on the side.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From Southeast Asia, sushi was adapted into Chinese cuisine. Later on, it became a popular food in Japan. We’re sure each country’s culture and palate had a lot to do with how sushi is made and presented today, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;20. Think Twice About Texas&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-753.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;We’re all still reeling from the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. Texas, in fact, is quite at a high risk for tornadoes. It is actually twice as more likely to be hit by tornadoes than any other American state. You may want to think twice about moving there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;19. That’s a Big Molehill&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-754.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Making a mountain out of a molehill may not seem like such a far reach now. moles are known for being industrious diggers. If given the chance, they can even make a 300-foot tunnel in a single night! If they’re not careful, they may reach the earth’s core without realizing it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;18. Don’t Wake the Sleepwalker!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-755.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Let’s debunk another myth, this time about sleepwalking. It is commonly thought that waking a sleepwalker could cause him or her serious health problems. These could include a heart attack, a deep shock, or high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;However, the truth is that these possibly fatal situations are not very likely. Still, it could be a bad idea to wake a sleepwalker. They may very possibly cause harm to themselves or to the person who dared to wake them! so steer clear and let them go back to bed on their own!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;17. Interesting Animal Talents&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-756.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Animals have their own hidden talents, which some human may love to have. for instance, a giraffe’s tongue is so long that it can easily lick its own ear! While this is not a very useful trick for us, it would definitely create a bit of a show!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;16. An Unbelievable Animal&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-757.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The duck-billed platypus is an extremely strange creature. It is a mammal, yet it lays eggs. Plus, the bill on a furry animal only adds to its weirdness. Scientists actually didn’t believe that such a thing existed until they saw one in person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. Behold the Beauty from Afar&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-758.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Butterflies are beautiful and delicate things. They may add to the beauty of a garden or park, but you may want to steer clear of them. They can feed on your blood if they get the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. The Lazy Water Relative&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-759.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;We usually see hippos relaxing in water. there’s a reason behind this; they are most closely related to sea creatures like whales or dolphins. Hence, they are actually more of a sea animal despite having legs!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Save Those Eggs!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-760.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The expiry date on eggs is more of a suggestion. The Food Safety and Inspection Service have declared this. As long as they are in the fridge, eggs can stay good for 3-5 weeks after their expiration date. The fridge would need to be at least 40 Fahrenheit or under, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. Not a Smart Bird&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-761.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Look closely at an ostrich, and you may notice something strange. It has a very large eye, but a very small head. in fact, ostrich’s eyes are larger than their brain! No wonder they’re not the smartest feathered friends around!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Run from the Sun&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-762.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Sunscreen is essential for protection from UV rays, which could be harmful to the skin. Don’t skip it even on cloudy days, though. The rays can easily go through the clouds and attack your delicate skin!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Lazy Lions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-763.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Those of us who grew up watching The Lion King think of lions as these fierce and dangerous beasts. Well, guess what? They are more likely to be asleep when you encounter them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lions actually sleep for most of the day. twenty hours out of twenty-four, to be exact. Lionesses are the ones who go out hunting bring the meat home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. More Laziness&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-765.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The sloth is a symbol of laziness for humankind. You may be surprised to know that it can’t even shiver to warm itself when it feels cold. We’re glad to not be that lazy!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Swifts the Superbird&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-767.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The swift may not be large, but it certainly has some fascinating abilities. For example, a swift can even stay airborne for over two hundred days! It catches its food while in the air, and can even sleep when flying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. The Eyes of the Desert Ship&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-769.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The camel is also named ‘the ship of the desert’. It has developed several features to help it cope with dry and dusty weather. While its hump stores water, its eyes also help it to be a valuable desert transport.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A camel’s eyes have no less than three eyelids. This way, it can keep its eyes ‘closed’ to protect itself from the sand when traveling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. The Mirage in the Sea&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-771.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;We’ve heard about mirages in the desert. That’s where one thinks there is water in the distance where there is none. However, Mauritius island near Madagascar has an underwater mirage of a different kind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically, this is an illusion of an underwater waterfall. Seems strange, but that’s a fact!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Interesting School Policy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-773.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Kelly Elementary school in Massachusetts fulfilled the dream of many a student by canceling homework for the whole school year! on the downside, it also meant extending the school day for two hours. This was done in the hope of improving academic performance. We can’t find many problems with this reasoning!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Armstrong’s Anger&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-775.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Neil Armstrong is known by everyone as the first man to step on the moon. However, he didn’t really like being in the limelight. In fact, he wanted to sue his barber, who sold his hair trimmings for three thousand dollars!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Crazy Curry&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-777.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the hottest curry in the world isn’t made in India. It’s actually made in Britain, with a chef who needs goggles for self-protection while making it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s named ‘The Widower”, and has been known to cause hallucinations for those who consume it. Want to try?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Tragic Indian Prodigy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-779.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Every now and then, a genius is born. However, they don’t always stay for long. Edward Thomas Clint was an Indian child and an art prodigy. He created more than thirty thousand paintings when still a tiny tot. Sadly, he passed away at the tender age of 7.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These facts may be strange, but they can definitely mix things up at a party! With these in your head, you’re not likely to get bored.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Shape of the Earth&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-781.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;techinabottle&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shape of the earth is in a process of constant changing. Its mainly due to the pull of gravity and the movement of the tectonic plates. This movement causes the pull of gravity to be irregularly distributed, which results in slight changes in the shape of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;The real shape of the earth is more accurately a “rotational ellipsoid”, because of the bulges it has at the equator due to the rotations. The image on the right shows how the gravity affects the shape of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"31 Amazing Facts to Make You Instantly Smarter","description":"Looking for a conversation starter?
