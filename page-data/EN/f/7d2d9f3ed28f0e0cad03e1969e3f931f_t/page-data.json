The deliverance of truth that is oh-so-ugly. We all know the painstaking details involved in fortifying a healthy relationship, but each strength carries some ugly truths that are more often than not brushed under the rug. These following facts are only too real about us, ladies. And that means no reason to hang your head in shame considering most of these effects are naturally intertwined into our thinking. But they still make for some knockers that are bound to give you second thoughts about YOUR niceness. Go figure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;You don’t feel the need to question his motives&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2241-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;All of us girls have been there. Marred with a past of trust issues and severe emotional whiplashes, you had effectively concluded at this point that all men are pigs. They are liars, cheats, and culprits of the highest order, or so it seemed. It turns out this one man in your life went against the status quo and became all that you ever sought in a guy. Things do turn out for the best in the end, it seems. And the guy you have, he is well and truly a goldmine if he proves you wrong when you question his motives time and time over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The disappointment is real (but never falls through)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2241-2-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Your past has had ample men who were colorfully distasteful. Often being left disappointed, or with a sour taste in your mouth, you were broken, to say the least. And in your head, why should’ve your newfound relationship been any different? But the pain and disappointment never showed up and what you got instead was more than you ever asked for, uninhibited and unrequited love that makes our insides go warm and fuzzy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;You never trust him (When you should’ve!)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2241-3-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Trust is a strange mechanism. It exists where it shouldn’t and vice versa. With a rich history that is filled to the brim of broken promises and trust, you feel guarded enough not to open your trust to anyone this time around. But lo and behold, for this one guy keeps prying open the gate to your heart with his crowbar if trusty presence. Keeping his promises is just one of the many reasons this guy really is the one for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;You’re feistier than he will ever be&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2241-4-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;You know you’ve played around aplenty for all the wrong reasons. You may have even bettered your adversaries (read: girlfriends) in the great game of hook, fish, and release. Despite knowing just how well the game has to be played and its rules, you still end up with a guy who isn’t intent on playing around at all. The fact that you are not at the very least a game to him means so much in itself. It helps even more if he shows you the game everyone is playing, just to be grounded and honest with you. He’s a keeper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;He is the perfect deal compared to your history&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2241-5-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;You feel like the complete letdown in front of him as your past doesn’t hold a candle of niceness to what he is now. You not only realize that you do injustice to his awesomeness but also feel like crap because of all that you’ve missing out on with this amazing human being. Being exposed to a barrage of toxicity in relationships over the past, You are left to ponder if life is really so unfair to you all along and for what reasons. They say life’s a b for a reason, girl.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Unwarranted apologies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2241-6-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;You are not exactly accustomed to having the men in your life apologize to you. All the other works of art you dated thought they were exempted from apologies, so you stopped expecting men to admit their faults when it comes to relationships. But this guy is not like everyone else. Regardless of who was more at fault, he never shies away from apologizing without you ever having to ask for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;His emotional understanding is a missing jigsaw piece&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2241-7-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;He never forces you to do anything you might not be comfortable in doing naturally.

Mr. Right is patient with you and willing to slacken his pace for you, happy with whatever you can offer him willingly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;He is always conducive to fixing fights&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2241-8-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;In all your previous relationships, all the apologies had to come from you while all that your significant other had to say would be asking you to either deal with it or walk away. This meant that all your issues were swept under the rug, rather than be catered to as you deserved. However, this time around, you have landed yourself a true gem. Not only does he want to resolve any issues that could be hampering the growth of your relationship, but is also willing to compromise and actively take part in the entire process. Your happiness and contentment are important to him, and he does not want you to resent him in the long run, which is why he’s adamant about not letting any conflicts come between the two of you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;He is nice without reciprocation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2241-9-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;He doesn’t love you on the condition that his feelings are met with love.

They lied to get what they wanted and cheated when they couldn’t get their hands on it. They would go to whatever lengths to service their agenda, without giving a second thought to your feelings. However, you can tell that this guy is different. While he would never put himself in a position where he has to lie to you, even if he is caught in one, he respects you enough never to belittle you with a lie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;He means everything to you&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/d-drafting-3-10-2241-11-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;He means the absolute world to you.
