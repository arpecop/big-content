Dubbed as the undisputed ‚ÄúKing of Pop‚Äù he was one of the most loved and popular entertainers in the world, while also being one of the best-selling music artists at the time of his death. Michael Jackson‚Äôs immense contributions to the worlds of music, dance, and fashion coupled with his highly publicized personal life made him a widely known global figure in pop culture for a period that spanned over a staggering four decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The eighth child of the substantially large Jackson family, Michael Jackson made his professional debut as a performer back in 1964 with his elder siblings Tito, Jackie, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the iconic Jackson 5. He later began his solo career in 1971 with a deal at Motown Records. On account of his musical prowess, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music in the early 1980s. His music videos were nothing short of iconic. He transformed music videos from mere lip-synching videos to something that could be used to relay an important message. His music videos including those of ‚ÄúBeat It,‚Äù ‚ÄúThriller‚Äù and ‚ÄúBillie Jean,‚Äù from his hit 1982 album Thriller, are believed to have not only broken deep-rooted racial barriers but also transforming the previously unknown medium into an art form and a promotional tool.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-926.jpeg&quot;/&gt;billboard &lt;p&gt;The popularity of these videos, added to the overwhelming presence of Michael Jackson, helped introduce the television channel MTV to fame. Michael Jackson was on a roll. His 1987 album, titled Bad, spawned the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 with not one but several number-one singles. Five of his songs, ‚ÄúDirty Diana,‚Äù ‚ÄúI Just Can‚Äôt Stop Loving You,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Way You Make Me Feel,‚Äù ‚ÄúBad,‚Äù and ‚ÄúMan in the Mirror,‚Äù all rose to number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. Owing to this success, the album ‚ÄúBad,‚Äù became the first ever album to have five number one singles on one album. His drive to succeed did not stop there. He continued to make innovating videos such as ‚ÄúBlack or White‚Äù and ‚ÄúScream‚Äù all through the 90s, and thus, managed to forge an identity as a touring solo artist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-927.jpeg&quot;/&gt;rollingstone &lt;p&gt;Through the performance-oriented mediums of stage and video, Michael Jackson made several dance techniques popular by association to him. One of his most noteworthy accomplishments as a dancer was that no matter what the dance move, he always remained indomitably himself. In the process of dancing, he not only managed to entertain us but also gave us a glimpse into the spectrum of human potential. He helped transform MTV to DTV, making tv a place where music came to be known to be accompanied by dance that was inundated with creativity and ingenuity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-928.jpeg&quot;/&gt;billboard &lt;p&gt;His music videos had pre-recorded vocals so that he could feature on the dance without being hindered by a mic. While his dancing seemed effortless, it was nothing but a deception. His intricate style is easier to decode than to replicate. His moves were as sharp when looked at in isolation as they were when part of the bigger picture. His body seemed weightless while dancing, free of the norms of gravity. He took familiar things and techniques, like shadow boxing, only to elevate them into something phenomenal. His moved, while usually drawn from athletics, came with such a heightened sense of flow and speed that it seemed anything but ordinary. Like the flawlessly articulated gliding steps that formed what came to be known as his signature moonwalk, Jackson‚Äôs nervy, high-speed turns seemed to operate in what felt like zero gravity. His dance seemed to flow effortlessly, with his finest dance performances giving in to the illusion of not being rehearsed, almost accidental in their perfect execution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While he was prepping for what was to be his iconic comeback concert series, This Is It, Jackson was found dead of what was allegedly termed acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from a cardiac arrest. After a thorough examination, the Los Angeles County Coroner ruled his death a homicide and his physician, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-929.jpeg&quot;/&gt;nypost &lt;p&gt;Jackson‚Äôs untimely death coupled with his immense stardom set off an unavoidable global outpouring of grief. A live broadcast of his public memorial service was viewed around the world. Even after his death, Michael Jackson continues to live on not only in people‚Äôs hearts but also as a substantial earner. Forbes magazine ranks him as the top-earning dead celebrity, with estimated earnings of a staggering $825 million in 2016, the highest yearly amount ever recorded by the renowned publication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now that we are all on the same page regarding the legendary status of the King of Pop, here is why it is so relevant. A woman posted what seemed to be a thoroughly innocent picture of her boyfriend on the internet, only to leave the internet buzzing with excitement. As it turns out, her boyfriend sports an uncanny resemblance to the late pop star, Michael Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;y&#39;all my man is so cute, look at the selfie he just sent me üòçüòç pic.twitter.com/VHbnk5xLM3&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;‚Äî lourdes (@gossipgriII) September 18, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;‚ÄòY‚Äôall my man is so cute, look at the selfie he just sent me,‚Äô Lourdes captioned the original picture. The photo depicts her boyfriend sitting in a car, wearing a baseball cap, and exhibiting features that share a stark resemblance to those of the late King of Pop. The image which was originally uploaded the previous Tuesday has managed to attract a lot of surprising attention with more than 10,000 likes and over a staggering 3,000 retweets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A woman named Lourdes Zavaleta, 21, took to social media to share a picture of her boyfriend in which he resembled the Thriller singer‚Äôs doppelganger and was quickly bombarded with replies from fellow Tweeters. People started gleefully quoting Jackson‚Äôs lyrics at her in what seemed a series of extremely cheeky and thoroughly entertaining puns. While people all over nmy7h6y7social media were going crazy at this revelation, indulging themselves by cracking jokes using lyrics from Jackson‚Äôs hit music, only a handful of people in the comments actually know that the man in the picture wasn‚Äôt really Lourdes‚Äô love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The song references just flew in:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Does he rock with you all night?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;‚Äî Homeboyüíñ (@jstderek) September 20, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;And in:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He shouldn&#39;t take selfies while driving.

She actually found the picture online and tweeted it as a joke, unknowingly booting it to the heights of internet fame. She never knew that a funny tweet would garner so much attention from people all over social media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The person depicted in the picture is actually named Sergio Cortes and is a musician by profession. He travels the world, working as a Michael Jackson impersonator, singing and dancing to remake the most iconic work of Michael Jackson. Cortes was actually brought into the world of showbiz when he was a mere 16 year old. A talent manager spotted him in school, noticed the stark resemblance to Jackson and the rest was history.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;It really is like looking in a mirror!&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;pic.twitter.com/36AlCpp1fQ&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;‚Äî Sergio Cort√©s (@SergioCort) January 20, 2015&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The resemblance with the late singer is so uncanny that in 1994, Cortes was hired as a getaway to trick the press when Jackson was getting married to Lisa Marie Presley. According to Cortes, the resemblance is real and he has not gone under the knife in an effort to look more like the Michael Jackson. He is currently touring with a live show dedicated to the life of Michael Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Posted by Sergio Cort√©s &amp;quot;Michael Jackson impersonator&amp;quot; on¬†Thursday, August 18, 2016&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;According to her, Lourdes believes it is cool on a whole new level, especially considering how it all started as a farcical banter between her and her peers. She found the replies and engagement really funny and is ecstatic about the viral retweets relating to her ‚Äòboyfriend‚Äô. And what‚Äôs more is that she feels like a major troll for having people actually believe that they‚Äôre actually going out. It all started on assumption and she just played on with the flow. But the one thing that still stands is how this event proves the evergreen passion that is thriving due to the iconic legends music and performance which moulded a love for him in our hearts forever. Loures believes so as well, as she remarked the almost religious love and support that still held for Mack the Jack. Michael Jackson does continue to intrigue and engage us beyond the grave.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What now:&lt;/h2&gt;     &lt;p&gt;People come and people go as do trends and this just might be another one of the hordes of one hit wonder spells that have bombed us thorught out this year. But the viral saga has touched lives as well across the world as the impersonator has embarked on the production of a show that features the King of Pop in a reminiscent limelight. We can only wish him good luck and Godspeed in an initiative that promises everything good for his fans who crave constant memorials. Michael lives!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Michael Jackson's Doppleganger Has Taken the Internet by Storm!","description":"A woman posted what seemed to be a thoroughly innocent picture of her boyfriend on the internet, only to leave the internet buzzing with excitement."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/f/e1fc91618b32687dd7acf87e634e768f_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/f/e5246aa5891a530d014220c82b0dadff_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"How to Improve a Relationship with Random Acts of Intimacy"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/f/cd4a0ca7360a102c13ba8b181d5ec92f_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Apply Pressure to These Points on Your Hand ‚Äì and Relieve Pain in Minutes"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
