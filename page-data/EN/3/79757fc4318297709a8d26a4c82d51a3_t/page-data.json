Amongst the siblings the eldest was nine years old at that time. During those times in Australia it was common that the children went around the town unaccompanied. After this incident the media went crazy over how it and the entire scenario in Australia changed in terms of being protective about the children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was widely believed that the children were seen with a blonde haired man after the day they disappeared. But the mother refused to accept this fact and said that it was not possible because the children were pretty shy around strangers. Even after so much time passed whatever happened to those children remains still a mystery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10.

They went on a hiking trip to find about the perfect slope. Despite all of them being extremely experienced hikers it was a shock that none of them was able to survive. The way they all died still remains a mystery, but the only similarity which exists is that they were all found outside the tents with very minimum clothing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It suggests the fact that they had to run for their lives from the tent they were sleeping in, and majority of them froze to death while three others ended up showing some signs of trauma. The exact reason of the death could still not be determined, many believe it to be some supernatural.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Most famous serial killer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1127.jpeg&quot;/&gt;wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Jack the Ripper was one of the most famous serial killer in London in the late 1880’s and indeed the very first. The reason for him to kill people for no reason still remains a mystery but the fact that sadistic people love to terrorize their victims by murdering them and ripping their body as was the case with Jack. As life leaves the body these people get pleasure in watching the reactions of their innocent victims.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8.

Although his mother claimed that Johnny visited her at night and told her that he cannot reveal his identity since his life is in danger. However, his story has never proved to be true, and even his wheel barrow could not help the police to find him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6.
