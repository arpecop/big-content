From your basic plain underwear to your cute lingerie, they have it all. Victoria’s Secret has been around for a long time now and they have over 1,000 stores worldwide. Have you ever thought about what it would be like to work there? Below are 15 rules that their employees have to follow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. There’s A Pecking Order That Rubs a Lot of Employees the Wrong Way&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your sales performance as an employee determines what zone you are put in on the floor. Employees with higher sales numbers get put in zones with more foot traffic. That becomes difficult for other employees to sell more when they’re being put in lower traffic areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. They Throw You into The Thick of Things with Very Minimal Training&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-641.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;One employee wrote on her blog that she had basically no training at all. She said that they rounded up all the trainees and made them watch a video and that is what their training consisted of.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. If There’s Shoplifting, They Can’t Do Much to Stop It&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If employees witness someone stealing, they’re not allowed to run after the thief and stop them. They have to call the cops and wait for them to come to the store.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. They Call Security If Couples Get Busy in The Change Rooms (Which Happens More Often Then You Think)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Employees at Victoria’s Secret are told to keep a really close eye on the dressing rooms so that men don’t try and go in with their girlfriends or wives. If they see men in the fitting rooms, they have to ask them to get out or they threaten to call security.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. They Tell Customers How Good They Look (Even When They Don’t Believe It)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One requirement of Victoria’s Secret employees is that they have to compliment customers. It makes sense because customers won’t buy something if they don’t think they look good in it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. They Used to Not Inform Customers on How to Maintain Bras (In Hope for More Sales)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;You are supposed to hand wash bras that are from Victoria’s Secret and many people did not know this because it was never required of employees to let customers know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. The Work Hours Are Grueling and They Only Get One Day Off a Week&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shifts at Victoria’s Secret are very long, and some employees find themselves working six days in a row and that is one reason they chose to quit.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;8. They Feel as Though They’re Pressured to Skip Breaks and Work Through Them&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-642.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;One of the major complaints of former employees is that even though they are allowed breaks, it is really hard to take them because the store is always packed and employees are always busy helping customers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. They Can’t Show Up to Work with A Hair Out of Place&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Victoria’s Secret is a store that’s all about looking your best and looking beautiful. So, it would make sense that employees have to live up to that standard. Some former employees found it annoying that they had to look good while being at work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. They Can Only Wear Black Clothes, Nothing Else&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is required of Victoria’s Secret employees to wear all black. Some former employees complained about this because they felt it was like wearing a uniform.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. They’re Required to ask You Three Times in a Row to Get a Victoria’s Secret Credit Card&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a rule that employees ask customers three times in a row about opening a store credit card. Managers are often under a lot of pressure to open as many cards as possible so that is why they came up with that rule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. They Can’t Move Around the Store When Working and Must Remain In Their Zones At All Times&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-643.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Another rule employees have to follow is they must stay in their one zone at all times. The reason for this is to prevent stealing, but it can get boring for employees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. They’re Always Put Under Pressure to Sell A Lot&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-644.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Employees are encouraged to sell a lot. This makes some employees feel very pressured because they have to put on a front and try to make things sound natural, when it’s not natural at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. They Can’t Wrap Presents While Working the Cash&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Employees aren’t allowed to gift wrap at the cash register because it holds up the lines and makes things less efficient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1.Only the Important People Go to The Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://relationshipgoals.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/word-image-645.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia     &lt;p&gt;Only managers of the top performing stores are invited to attend the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"15 Rules You Won't Believe Victoria's Secret Workers Have to Follow","description":"  Wikipedia Everyone knows that Victoria’s Secret is the best place to go for underwear, lingerie, and beauty products.
