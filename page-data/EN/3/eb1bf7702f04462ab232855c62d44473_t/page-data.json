It is a gift of God to humanity. The chirping birds, the lush green grass, the breeze of air, the rushing water, all these things are life giving. Forests are the only place where nature can be observed in its very original and lavish form. The forests have nurtured many wild animals and wildlife has adopted remarkable ways to maintain its existence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes when you are not careful enough or thinking something is not important enough, it is possible that you are not looking clearly. If you think you have got a good sight and pick the little details of a certain area with just a glimpse or a little focus, or you don’t miss anything that comes in your sight, well this is a chance for you to make it official because we have compiled 10 pictures of animals hiding in plain sight so perfectly that it is not easily possible for one to point them. After reading this article don’t think that your eyes are playing tricks on you because you might actually be seeing an animal hiding in plain sight. Let’s just say that this article might improve your eyesight or the way you look at nature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Try to see if you can find the animals hiding in plain sight in these eye bending images. The camouflages here are some of the best nature has to offer!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Snakes with amazing texture&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1742.jpeg&quot;/&gt;SssnakeySci // Twitter &lt;p&gt;Finding a snake in this picture is as hard as catching a spiky fish in rushing water with bear hands. Snakes have the most amazing natural textures and their textures differ with their geographical locations. Their crawl is not easy to detect. So this gives them advantage to catch their prey without being detected. In this picture the snake is of the color and texture of dry leaves right in the middle of the picture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1743.jpeg&quot;/&gt;SssnakeySci // Twitter &lt;h2&gt;9. A stick or a stick insect&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1744.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;In this picture what do you actually see? A bunch of leaves attached to a stick. Well if you think so, think again. The brown thing that seems like a stick is an insect known as stick insect. Stick insect looks like a walking twig. It uses its stick like structure to camouflage and blend with its surroundings. It helps it to stay clear of the predators and surviving through dangers by blending in. Their straight and non-curvy structure helps them to get the attention of predators away from them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1745.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;h2&gt;8. Find the toad&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1746.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;Toads can be found near ponds and lakes and mostly marshy places where it is easy for them to find insects like bugs, mosquitoes and flies etc. But it is not just the food that they need for their survival. They have to survive through the threat of being fed on by other predators for example snakes. For that they have adopted with time the color and texture of their surroundings, mostly leaves or damps. In this picture all most of you can see might be just leaves but actually there are, not one, not two but three toads facing north east and west. You can find them just with a little focus and keen observation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1747.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;h2&gt;7. Spider in the grains&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1748.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;Spiders are the eight legged insects that feed on other insects with their great ability of making web which is a silken structure that spiders secrete from their abdomen. With this they can catch sometimes preys bigger than their own size as they get stuck in it once they get in contact of it, giving spiders a signal and they get there to cover the prey in their web. But they mostly avoid their predators in the food chain/ food web by placing themselves in surroundings similar to their own colour, making themselves able to hide in plain sight and wait for their prey to get stuck in their web helpless so they could devour it. You can find spider right in the diagonal intersection of this picture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1749.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;h2&gt;6. The philosopher Bird&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1750.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;The philosopher bird (owl) tries to avoid competition. They are nocturnal in habitat and they come out at night to catch their prey when the other big birds are not out in search. They spend their day time hiding. In this picture the owl is hiding in plain sight and it is even difficult for humans to find it unless someone knows what they are looking for. Their vivid colors help them remain hidden for longer times depending on their surroundings and also their not being in a single solid color makes them difficult to find in night giving them ledge to find and catch their prey with less effort than their fellow birds. You may notice their closed eyes, this shows their intelligence as they are doing this to blend in with the surrounding.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1751.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;h2&gt;5. Mighty geckos&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1752.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;Geckos are the masters of camouflage. When hiding they are almost impossible to be seen. You might stare at the pictures of their camouflage for ages but will still not be able to spot them, making their chances of survival a lot even with just little or no effort at all. One of their species, most commonly known as leaf tale geckos, is considered satanic as they seem no more than just a leaf and you good luck to you if you are trying to find them in a bunch of leaves. You can spend hours spotting them and there is a chance what you spotted is actually a gecko because you can never be sure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1753.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;h2&gt;4. The grasshopper&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1754.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;Grasshoppers are insects similar to the stick insects. They are omnivorous and feed on animal feaces and plant tissues. So their habitat is mostly among green plants to feed on but they also try to remove a threat of being spotted in open area so they have adopted green color, the color of their surroundings, to live for longer periods without becoming a prey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their compound eyes help them to not get drawn attention towards them. Here in this picture you can find the grasshopper standing on the leaves. Their long legs for jumping don’t help them much in their disguise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1755.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;h3&gt;3. Caterpillar&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1756.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;Can you spot the caterpillar in this picture? There is a caterpillar on that leaf, now can you? Well it is not that easy as the caterpillars, with time, have evolved to avoid their predators. They mostly are in the shape of a leaf and they mostly stay among them to hide themselves. Their texture and shape is remarkable for a camouflage in animals. Their evolution helps them to survive through their stage of being a caterpillar and then their cocoon protects them unless they turn into a butterfly. A butterfly is not as camouflaged as caterpillar however its wings help it to fly away from dangers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1757.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;h3&gt;2. Squirrel: Natural camouflage colors&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1758.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;The color and texture of squirrels naturally serve as camouflage. They are mostly found on tree stems and their texture is similar to that of tree’s bark and they camouflage themselves to stay away from predators and get their food easily. They cannot digest cellulose that’s why they feed on food rich with proteins mostly found on trees so they have adopted the vivid color and texture of the trees. Squirrels can live longer because of their naturally gifted camouflage ability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Squirrels have many natural predators which makes their camouflage ability more important for their survival. If you have trees around your house, look closely and you might actually find a squirrel looking back at you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1759.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;h3&gt;1. Ptarmigans or snowbirds&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1760.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur &lt;p&gt;The ptarmigans are beautiful birds with their brownish color. In summer their brownish feathers covering them help disguise them and hide them from predators but in winter season when everything is covered with snow it could be hard not to be seen in those brownish feathers. Well, it’s not hard for ptarmigan atleast. They change the color of their feathers to pure white in winters and blend perfectly in their surroundings. Their color helps them survive in dangers of becoming a prey. In this picture look for the black eyes and beak to spot them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/word-image-1761.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Imgur     &lt;p&gt;So, this was it! We can bet that this information has left you wondering just how wonderful the Mother Nature is. How this animals live in plain sight is remarkable. With their ability they not only dodge predators but have also managed to survive and evolve over the years. Just imagine how life would have been for us humans if majority of predators could camouflage themselves, not good I’d guess.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"We Bet You Can't Find All the Animals in These Photos","description":"We bet you can’t find these animals in plain sight"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/3/eb1bf7702f04462ab232855c62d44473_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/3/f03960e0e4123eb817b96f6ede3480f3_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"14 of the Richest Women in the World"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/3/e46fe525afea5cb5d3dd9cbec8202223_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"19 Ways Google Does Evil"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
