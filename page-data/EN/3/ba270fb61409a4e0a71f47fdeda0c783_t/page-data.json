Use honey instead of sugar, and real cacao powder instead of readymade chocolate. This way, your chocolates could be paleo and even keto friendly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the fun doesn’t have to stop at strawberries. Line the compartment of your ice cube tray with the chocolate, freeze it and then use fillings of your choice.
