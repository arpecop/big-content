Whether you consider yourself to be a womanizer or just want to understand the opposite sex better we’ve got a fix for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Women are complex creatures and some might argue that’s what makes them so intriguing, but there’s a certain faction of the male society that fails to understand and comprehend how women function. They’re sly and sometimes slightly over conscious about themselves and their surroundings. They don’t give off any signs of weakness that can be used by men easily. It’s always a complicated situation when dealing with a woman and her desires. You might think she’s ready to get in bed with you whereas she might have already called for her Uber ride back home. So, unless you want to live a life full of such self-made theories that exist only in your head it’s better to take some advice about how to identify the tiny chinks in the armor of the next woman you’re trying to woo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sleeve Raising&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1708.jpeg&quot;/&gt;www.shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Let’s start with one of the easiest yet hidden signals that a woman gives off when she’s genuinely interested in a man. It’s all about the wrists. The wrist is probably one of the most neglected body parts we possess, think about it when is the last time you stopped to notice someone’s wrists? Well, pay close attention next time. Behavioral psychologist and dating Coach Jo Hemmings explained how a woman is tempted to play with her sleeves by rolling them up when her tummy tickles. It is one of the first indicators of attraction conveyed by her. It’s her way of showing off her feminine, soft and delicate side. However, it might also mean that she’s just feeling hot. We’ll leave that up to you to decide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Genuine Smile&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1709.jpeg&quot;/&gt;www.shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;There’s nothing more beautiful than the raw, natural and real smile of a woman. And as they say the best things in life don’t come easy, it isn’t as easy to make a woman genuinely smile. It can be hard to figure out whether your crush is actually smiling or just faking. But if you want to find out, all you have to is pay close attention to her face, specifically the muscles around her eyes and mouth. These are the muscles that force a genuine smile, and if you’re not seeing much action in those muscles when she smiles, that just means you need to up your game. A study conducted by French physician Guillame Duchenne was aimed at realizing the difference between a fake smile and a real one. It was deduced that the muscles used in smiling can be used for pretend smiles and real smiles both. The only difference found was that the muscles around the mouth apparently contract when we’re trying to force it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mirroring&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1710.jpeg&quot;/&gt;www.shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Now, it’s time to look at the bigger picture that is you! A better understanding of one’s own body language opens the door for a concrete realization of indicators. To begin with, observe what you do when you’re around her. Do you sit back with your hands behind your head? Do you have both your legs crossed around the ankles? Are you sitting upright and solid?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you’ve taken notice of your posture and body position, pay attention to hers. If she’s imitating your body behavior that means she’s interested in you. That’s the concept of mirroring. This is what people subconsciously do when they’re interested in the other person. Another fancy word for this symbolic connection is “limbic synchrony”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Foot Position&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1711.jpeg&quot;/&gt;www.shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;While you’re focusing on the mirroring aspect, be sure to keep an eye out for her foot position. Ex FBI agent Joe Navarro states that the legs and the feet are the most honest body part we have. Whenever we meet someone we don’t like, we subconsciously move our legs and feet in the opposite direction. Just like that if you’re standing with your crush among a group of friends, keep a close look out for her foot position. She might be talking to someone else but if her feet point towards you, that means you’ve got a good thing going with her and she’s interested in you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Gaze&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1712.jpeg&quot;/&gt;www.shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;They say that the eyes are the windows to the soul. This tends to be true for most lovers as they are found wandering off into each other’s eyes while ignoring everything that is happening around them. People generally look more directly at people they like rather than those they dislike. If she’s connecting with you via her gaze, it is an actual sign that she’s attracted to you.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;This phenomenon is ever present in clubs and bars, when you gaze at a girl on the other side of the bar and she returns the favor, it means she noticed you and she liked it. That’s your chance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Blinking&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1713.jpeg&quot;/&gt;www.shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The next time you see your crush blinking more than normal, don’t just assume that she’s caught something in her eye. Just think of that flirting cliché of batting your eyelashes at someone you like. There’s actually some science behind it. Body language expert and founder of the nonverbal group Blake Eastman explains that there is a correlation between blink rate and arousal. Blink rates generally spike when you’re close to someone you like. So pay attention to how many times a woman blinks, if it’s more than the average ten blinks per minute that means she’s trying to tell you she’s into you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Dilating Pupils&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1714.jpeg&quot;/&gt;www.shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Controlling pupil movements is next to impossible. At the same time when a woman’s pupil dilates it means that there is definitely something there! It’s not just happening, there’s a reason behind it. Unless she uses the ancient method of putting the plant belladonna in her eyes to artificially dilate her pupils.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, that happened. But it happened because even back then women knew how to attract men. Pupils also dilate in dim light and when you’re under rage, but as long as you stay clear of these dilemmas, a woman’s eyes can tell you a lot about her interests. When we have a strong emotional response to something, dopamine is released in the brain which meddles with the eye’s nerve endings eventually leading to dilation of the pupils.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Blushing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1715.jpeg&quot;/&gt;www.shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Another involuntary body state we find ourselves in is blushing. When her face turns all red and pinkish, that means she’s blushing. Scientifically speaking when humans see something they like, the rush of adrenaline widens the capillaries that bring blood to the surface of the skin. In medieval times, blushing was used as a sign to initiate primal mating between individuals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s believed that’s where the modern day blush-on found in makeup kits originated from. Blushing can also be caused by fear and anxiety. But more frequently it is caused by the awkwardness and shyness women have to overcome when they’re interested in a man.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Self-soothing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1716.jpeg&quot;/&gt;www.shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;These are some overt flirting techniques that are universally considered to be indicators of attraction. They include actions like playing with their hair, twirling strands of it around her finger or brushing her fingers across her cheeks. This kind of self-touching can happen subconsciously when a woman is interested in someone. It commonly happens with the hair, but it can also involve the neck, shoulder and thighs. In fact, if she’s stroking her leg while talking to you, it could be a solid indicator of how much she wants you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Flared Nostrils&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1717.jpeg&quot;/&gt;www.shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;We saved the best one for last, as this is something that is impossible to fake and can be very easily identified provided you know about it. There are similarities between the conceptions of blushing and nose flaring. As blushing is down to the amount of adrenaline released in the blood stream, nose flaring is down to the need for more oxygen. The technical term for it is “nasal wing dilation”. This can be an involuntary response to feelings of altercation as well. But there are always to sides to a story. So, we’ll look at the positive aspect that deals with the factor of attraction among men and women.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;So we’ve come to the conclusion that there is much more that meets the common eye. If we look closely at our interactions with those women or men that we’re interested in, we’ll find out all of the above mentioned indicators are actively present. I bet no one ever told you about the flaring nostrils bit, or the dilating pupils bit. Well, this was our way of passing on some crucial knowledge we’ve acquired from tons of experiences. The next time you’ll be having coffee with the woman of your dreams, keep a look out for her movements but don’t make it obvious. Women are generically much smarter than men are, the slightest feeling of suspicion may throw off a woman and her sub conscious movements. If you’re keeping it subtle, I’m sure you’ll have no trouble figuring it all out for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Indications That You Want Him Badly Now","description":"Things you must know"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/3/6a84cad21f8c712a76486e4f1a574073_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/3/79757fc4318297709a8d26a4c82d51a3_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"11 Real Footage of Mysteries That Will Never Be Solved"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/3/662da49fea4adfe0cadb2ecdb5bc7553_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Insane Pools You Won't Believe Actually Exist"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
