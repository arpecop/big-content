We are so engrossed in our lives that we fail to notice that certain changes of our lives. Every year when its your birthday after you become an adult you often wonder “Man I have become 25?” Very often we even notice to fail the change in our lives and continue with the same teenage behavior. It takes time for us to understand that we have actually grown up and need to start taking our lives in a certain direction. Since it is the milestone year of our lives the changes are more noticeable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1169.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;If you have not started work, the moment you turn actually 25 you will begin wondering and looking for work. You need to take it seriously because after you are 25 it is important to realize the fact that its high time to plan life and determine its direction. Plus, since you will be new to the work life things might seem dauting and exhausting for you. It might not have been your dream job but you still have to do it since there is no other option at present.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Family&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1170.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;The way your family responds towards you also change once you hit the number 25. Your parents must be expecting you to be independent in your life now since they have done their share. You will get to know them differently now and will experience some changes in the way you spent time with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You also start experiencing a completely different relationship with your siblings. The bonding starts to get more intense and more loving. No matter how disapproving you were of them in the teem years you will now start to get along with them seriously! If you are young you might end up having discussions with them about future and they might be helping you around with how to manage life on your own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most important relationship is the one between you and your mother. While you spent all those teen years telling her that she is wrong and you want to do things your way. Since you have grown up you will experience that you need her more now and want her insight as a learning experience for yourself. Thus you might grow more closer towards your mother!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Friends&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1171.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;The happy go lucky group of friends you were are now becoming all grown-ups! You would start feeling the change in their behavior too since it will be a growing up phase for all of you. The random discussions about boyfriends cheating on you or the fight with dad will now all change towards “Hey I got a job”! or “it’s my graduation tomorrow!”. So just be prepared for this new journey of life with friends. Also, before it was easier to hang out at any time of the week since you were all studying or working part time. But since you start to take up full time employment it will become difficult for you to meet them and the only meet ups after 25 are anniversaries, weddings, and birthdays.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Relationships&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1172.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;It is important to realize that you need to step out of the girlfriend boyfriend zone if you are considering a relationship seriously. You both need to talk it out with each other and be more committed towards each other if you are seriously considering being settled as husband and wife. You tend to become more serious and more loving towards your other half and start to take care of them in a more caring manner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if you are not willing to commit to anyone it is also okay too! Not everyone wants to get in that getting married thingy! A lot of people would be asking you when are you getting settled but you need to ignore them and just stay happy in your choices since you made them and are quite satisfied with it.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;Travelling&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1173.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Travel goals are really changing after you grow up! Your priorities change about hanging out once you hit the 25 mark. Before that you liked loud places such as concerts but now you like peaceful places since you have become more patient and calm. Even travelling with your partner also becomes different because you start to have so much on your mind that there is little time for travel!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ideals&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1174.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Wile you might adore a certain guy when you were a teenager might start to appear less attractive now. This is because you feel attracted towards more settled guys because you yourself are looking to get settled in life now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Eating habits&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1175.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Your eating habits are also changing at 25. Before you were a hog eating all the junk food you wanted to eat but now you become a picker. This is because you tend to see your body in a different way now and want to maintain a healthy lifestyle now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the hangovers last for longer days now you are unable to stay unhealthy! But you do miss the old you at times and want to get back to that time to relive certain memories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Being independent&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1176.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Now that you are 25 you become more independent. You start managing your own money and maintain it yourself. Since before you used to feed on your pocket money now you have a lot of money with you! Its time to start planning expenditures more carefully now because you need to save money for future as well. Moreover, the current expenditures of living need to be maintained by you independently. Since you are also living alone now and you like it that way you have to handle money matters effectively.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Life happens&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1177.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Your responsibilities take a U-turn after you reach that mark. You will start experiencing the real-life crisis and get to know about your purpose. Things start to change and your perception towards a lot of issues take a different viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You get to meet a new version of yourself and also those who are around you tend to make more sense to you. There might be new challenges for you laying ahead making you feel nostalgic about those teen years! But you can not tick that clock back. So, it is important not to feel alone in this phase and do not take everything so seriously.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being alone is good for you but you should be careful not to forget everyone else in your life since you become engrossed in taking your life further!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A lot of changes appear when you turn 25! Celebrations, friends, love, relationship end up changing your perception towards life. Now the fact that a certain people wished you birthday on Facebook or that many texts you got.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;But you actually get happy at the prospect of getting that surprise quiet party from your friends since it shows which people actually care about you! You become more cleverer and sound in your decisions since you have learnt it all in the teens. It is also noticeable that you become more careful about the kind of people who are around you since you can tend to be more hesitant towards trusting people. The most important factor is that you enjoy it all and make it memorable for you!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"11 Spot-On Comics About How Our Life Changes After 25","description":"Since it is the milestone year of our lives the changes are more noticeable."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/3/acb96db7d8b76e0a210c2160255f12b3_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/3/ad9864604a96f12ba08d52ab20b4be03_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"9 Habits Build Trust in a Long Lasting Relationship"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/3/a7107b4572d4e75c19821b4a5d34b4a3_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"8 diet secrets from a dermatologist that will make your skin perfect"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
