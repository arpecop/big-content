I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago. But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;pic.twitter.com/X6ybi5atr5&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Kevin Spacey (@KevinSpacey) October 30, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier, Rapp, who is a regular on the TV show Star Trek: Discovery, while giving an interview to Buzzfeed alleged that Spacey, who currently stars in Emmy-nominated political drama House of Cards, tried to seduce him after a party in 1986.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He picked me up like a groom picks up the bride over the threshold. But I don’t, like, squirm away initially, because I’m like, ‘What’s going on?’ And then he lays down on top of me,” said Rapp.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 46 year old actor continued, “I don’t know if I would have used that language. But I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Rapp, he met spacey in 1986 when both actors were performing on Broadway shows. Spacey, who was 26 at the time, invited Rapp to a party at his Manhattan apartment. However, after reaching the party Rapp felt bored as there were only adults over there and went into the bedroom to watch television. He only found out the party had ended when Spacey entered the room. According to him, Spacey was clearly drunk and that is when he tried to get sexual with the 14 year old young actor.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-administrator-downloads-31-10-2566-01-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wiki &lt;h2&gt;Why is Rapp speaking out now?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In his interview the actor said that he had hoped to never see Spacey again after that encounter which happened almost three decades ago. However, it is only now that he gathered the courage to speak out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The actor, who started his career as a child star when he was 9 years old said that he spoke about his story now after getting encouraged by many men and women who have also spoken about their similar experiences. He clarified that he would not want to say anything else regarding the matter for now. Rapp hopes that his story will help in addressing the matter of sexual assault and prevent such incidents from happening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Netflix Cancels House of Cards&lt;/h2&gt;     &lt;p&gt;In the wake of these allegations, Netflix, announced that it will be ending House of Cards after its upcoming 6th Season. The season is scheduled to air in 2018. This announcement came just 24 hours after Spacey publically responded to the sexual assault allegations. However, a Netflix spokesperson responding to Guardian Australia confirmed that the decision to end the hit political drama was taken months earlier.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Kevin Spacey Apologizes for Alleged Sex Assault with a Minor","description":"&quot;I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago.&quot;"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/3/b55b3023cc5a143b2e4277bac602c4b3_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/3/ba270fb61409a4e0a71f47fdeda0c783_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"If You Think Your Ice Cube Tray Is Just for Water, Take a Look at These 11 Brilliant Tricks"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/3/ad9864604a96f12ba08d52ab20b4be03_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"9 Habits Build Trust in a Long Lasting Relationship"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
