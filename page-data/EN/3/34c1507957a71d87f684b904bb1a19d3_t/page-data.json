Wearing uncomfortable and heavy costumes, working constantly from dusk till dawn, acting outdoors in extreme weathers without the clothing appropriate for that weather, and sometimes performing stunts without any precautionary measure and risking one’s life for just a single scene is nothing every person can do. It requires nerves and courage and we love our beloved TV and Silver screen stars for doing such things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However sometimes actors, like all of us, also are brought into such scenarios where they are on the horns of Dilemma and are not able to act in some specific scenes due to some personal and ethical values which are an important aspects of their personal lives. There are some of the very well-known and versatile actors and actresses all across the globe who do not give a second thought to film some scenes and simply say “NO” to the film directors no matter how much it costs them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our views, there is nothing bad in saying “NO” to act in certain scenes. Every person has his or her own fears, sensitivities, and personal point of views when it comes to filming some scene. When any scene does not resonate with the personalities of the actors, they refuse to act in them which is totally understandable for a reasoning brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let us have a look at top 10 famous scenes which our beloved actors and actresses refused to film in and also at the reasons due to which they didn’t act in those scenes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10.

But almost all of us were previously unaware of the fact that the lead casts that were Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams have cried more than us during the filming.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;This was not because of the fact that they felt the intensity of the story too much, but because that these two hated each other and at one point in filming the movie, they had to take a whole day off because Ryan left the sets after getting frustrated with Rachel. But somehow, the makers sorted that out and the film was at least recorded successfully.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"10 Surprising Scenes Actors Refused to Film (And Why)","description":"How we see different characters in movies is not always the same in real.
