Well, I believe it is totally up to the couple as to how they take the relationship further. This is because this is a big change in the life of any couple. It is about responsibility they have never experienced before as girlfriends and boyfriends. The fact that it is not always happily ever after but it is still worth it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1432.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;You know you are married when at the middle of the night you feel that you are being thrown off a mountain and then you get to hear a thud! Ow you get up and feel a mild pain in your head and then you feel that you are on the floor! For a minute you start wondering if you landed accidently on the floor. When you try to get back you see that she is laying in a completely different position in which she ensures that she occupies the whole bed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story does not end here my friend! If either of you snores during the sleep life can be quite miserable for your better half because the other person will always be deprived of a good night‚Äôs sleep. All you can do is end up wondering ‚ÄúIs that the person I fell for like seriously?‚Äù. Wake up boy! The result is just beside you snoring high! LOL moment&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1433.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Okay so since you both are married now your grocery list will change. It might just involve a lot of items you might have never shopped for before. The examples are lotions, perfumes, make up in case of boys. As for girls you might have to incorporate shaving materials, after shaves, or some heavy load of junk food which you have always tried to avoid due to weight issues!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1434.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Guys usually do not like to cook anything for themselves thanks to the delivery services available easily. But since you are married now you might have the privilege to eat home made stuff if your girlfriend who is now your wife loves to cook and knows about the kitchen. If she turns out to be just like you I am sure you would be finding ways to earn more! Otherwise if she is the experimenting type then There might be days when you have to eat a slightly raw fish which require more time in the oven and still say that it‚Äôs the best you have ever had! Cheers!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1435.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Since you have always been independent you have handled your money matters yourself. But now after you are married she will want to take care of it herself. Even if she is earning her own money even then you should handover yours to her! Guys who are reading this might think that I am being biased and just supporting women! LOL You might just want to discuss it together before hand so that both of you agree on it. Trust me it is always better that you both reach a consensus on what needs to be done with the money rather than fighting about it later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1436.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Cleaning up the house becomes the responsibility of both of you after you get married. Couples often tend to have a fight on this one but it a necessary and requirement to be looked after by both the partners amicably. The more you help each other the better it gets between both of you. Moreover, it is better to give you wife some rest on the weekend and treat her like she still is your girl like before. This does wonders to your relationship. Trust me!&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;7. Room&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1437.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Alright before marriage you had the room to yourself with your girlfriend or boyfriend occasionally visiting and the rule would have been not to open up the closet if you are not a cleanliness freak! Since the entire stuff could be found in the closet and the room clean, but now the tables have turned dude! You have to make space for your better half not only in the room but in the closet as well! So yea its time to sort out mess in the room and prepare for the future! TADA&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Seeing each other in every phase&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1438.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Before marriage you both used to see each other at a certain time, dressed appropriately, eagerly waiting for each other and finally happy to meet. But after getting married you would feel completely different as you get to see her applying that charcoal mask or get to see him staying glued to the tv on the weekend! It is an entirely different experience the one that will make you both get closer to each other and is sure to increase the love amongst you both! *batting the lashes*&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1439.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;This is the cutest as well as the most cumbersome part which requires 24/7 available emotional support for your ex-girlfriend-now-wife as well the future mom of the baby. So, it is important that you both prepare for this phase of life before hand because its going to be one hell of a journey! Since before marriage you guys used to spend your weekends roaming around so after the baby enters your life your job as mum and dad on the weekend would be to look after your baby. The nights are going to be sleepless since the baby keeps waking you up by crying! Be prepared for those trash bags full of smelling pampers! ROFL moment!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1440.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Before you both married you might have not seen each other‚Äôs families that much. Now that you are married you both have got a new set of parents, siblings, and other extended family members. As you are the new member in so, you have got to prepare to see them often now. Also, it is better to get to know them at a more deeper level like you do for your spouse. Respecting each other‚Äôs family will be quite helpful for the relationship and will increase the affection amongst the families as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1441.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Before you both used to make many plans for travelling and going out together. But after you get married the responsibilities increase for both of you and many of the trips just remain ‚Äúplanned‚Äù and never gets executed in reality!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1442.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos &lt;p&gt;Before marriage you both used to send text, voice notes to each other a thousand times during the day expressing your love for each other. Sounds lovey dovey right! üòä But as soon as you get married the nature of the text might get different and as you become parents it might just not be there. It would be better to keep the spark in the relationship and stay expressive in love otherwise it might fade out!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1443.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos     &lt;p&gt;Before you are married the future conversations are usually about getting settled, planning the wedding and what would you do for each other. But as soon as you tie the knot the future gets really different for both of you. It becomes the talk about when to start the family, how to manage expenses and what to do in order to change the quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"12 Ways Your Life Changes Before and After Marriage","description":"It is about responsibility they have never experienced before as girlfriends and boyfriends.
