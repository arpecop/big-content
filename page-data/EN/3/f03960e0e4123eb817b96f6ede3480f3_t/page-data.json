One of these lists is about the richest women to have walked the earth. In the bipolar world that we live in, it is not uncanny to find women working and earning on the same level as men. If Cleopatra and Queen Victoria were able to rule kingdoms then surely women today can run businesses and even countries. Following the death of former richest woman Liliane Bettencourt, the daughter of the founder of L‚ÄôOreal Eugene Schuelle, questions were raised on who would be declared now as the richest of them all. The deceased Liliane Bettencourt enjoyed a massively luxurious lifestyle after inheriting her father‚Äôs wealth and, through her sense of entrepreneurship, taking L‚ÄôOreal to the next level making it one of the most sold cosmetic brands in the world. So no wonder everyone‚Äôs curious to know the name of the woman who would take Liliane Bettencourt‚Äôs place. Well, the wait is over as the new list is up! We have the richest woman on the planet, and we are about to disclose her name. But not just that, we bring you, next 14 runner-ups, as well. So let‚Äôs have a look at the profiles of the top 15 richest women in the world alive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Margaretta Taylor&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-2235-1-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tumblr &lt;p&gt;Margaretta Taylor, the sharer of Cox Enterprises, has bread run in her family. From wealth passed on by her grandfather James M. Cox- a former Governor of Ohio and the founder of Cox Enterprises ‚Äì to her mother Anne Cox Chambers, Margaretta Taylor has had quite the luck. She along with her two siblings got equal percentage share from her mother‚Äôs inheritance, i.e., 17% of the 49.9% share Anne Cox Chambers had from her father‚Äôs company. So basically today, Margaretta Taylor has an earnings of $8.5 billion with her son being the Chief Operating Officer at Cox Enterprises. Although an heiress of her massive media empire, Margaretta Taylor donates a lot to wildlife and humanity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Katharine Rayner&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Posted by Katharine Rayner on¬†Friday, December 16, 2016&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Margaretta Taylor‚Äôs Sister Katharine Rayner enjoys her 17% share in much the same way. What does she know about living with no money? Having $8.5 billion in her hand every month, what is it that she can‚Äôt have? Nothing. Being an inheritor of the Cox Enterprises, Katharine Rayner lives a lavish life. The Cox Enterprises owns media publications and brands that provide Katharine enough money to feed generations. As one of the owners of the company, Katharine is quite relaxed and content with earning money without any work. She enjoys her leisure time and like her sister makes donations to help humanity and wildlife.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Zhou Qunfei&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;p&gt; ‚Äì Zhou Qunfel #stocks #forex #wallstreet #nyse #nasdaq #money #business #tsx #markets #stockmarket #entrepreneur #dowjones #finance #economy #stockexchange #daytrader #investor #stocktrader #trader #education #motivation #inspiration #learn #billions #wealth #investmentbanking #millions #zhouqunfei #lenstechnology #hongkong&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A post shared by ü¶àüìà (@stocksharks) on Mar 27, 2017 at 1:13pm PDT&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zhou Qunfei is known as the world‚Äôs richest self-made woman originating from China. A school drop-out, she is the only billionaire woman to grow herself into what she is today. Zhou Qunfei is the founder of Lens Technology, a screen producing company for smartphones. She started building herself up at the age of 22 by selling watch lenses and today has companies standing in line for her to provide screens for their phones. Starting off as a watch repairer back in the 90s, Zhou Qunfei is now the receiver of $11.4 billion every month. Her big breakthrough was in 1993 when Motorola asked her to create a screen for its phone Razr V3 at a time when touch screen didn‚Äôt even exist. Even though Motorola isn‚Äôt out there anymore, it made Zhou Qunfei what she is today and who knows she‚Äôs thankful to Motorola for that. After that, Zhou started creating phone screens for other companies like Samsung, Nokia, and HTC. Her company is a now a regular screen creator for Apple iPhones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Blair Parry-Okeden&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Blair Parry-Okeden: Australian billionaire you‚Äôve never heard of https://t.co/Zzgve8WDbY pic.twitter.com/NSjVSVSXXc&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;‚Äî redball (@redball2) April 25, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An American living in Australia, Blair Parry-Okeden replaced Gina Rinehart in 2016 as the richest woman in Australia that landed her in 11th position worldwide. To your surprise, Blair Parry-Okeden is the granddaughter of James M. Cox and is much richer than her cousins Margaretta Taylor and Katharine Rayner. Living poles apart from where Cox Enterprises is, Blair‚Äôs net worth is around $7 billion, and she has to do absolutely nothing to earn that. She got a 25% share from her grandfather‚Äôs company and a life in utmost luxury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Abigail Johnson&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/10/c-users-khurram-mehboob-downloads-2-10-2235-5-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikimedia &lt;p&gt;Family wealth worked out pretty well for Abigail Johnson too as she is today the CEO, the president, and the chairman of Fidelity Investments, a firm started by her grandfather. She succeeded her father as the chairman, and the company is now directly controlled by her. Her net worth is $15.1 billion making her the 10th richest woman on the planet. Abigail Johnson is the only woman to represent Fidelity Investments on board of Financial Services Forum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Gina Rinehart&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;via @BellaFlokarti #GinaRinehart Quote#Auspol #LNP #SpringSt #NSWpol#QLDpol #NTpol #WApol #saparli #politas #Abbott @banas51 #LNPMemes pic.twitter.com/SAVpVUqnKb&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;‚Äî TALAOLP (@Talaolp) September 16, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though she had lost her position as the richest woman in Australia in 2016 as mentioned above, Gina Rinehart stands 9th today worldwide. But how is that possible? Well, I suppose Gina couldn‚Äôt stand lacking behind and so regained her throne to become Australia‚Äôs richest woman again in 2017. Anyways, wealth runs in the blood of these affluent people. Gina Rinehart is another inheritor of the family business. She received 76.6% of her father‚Äôs company Hancock Prospecting which made her net worth of about $75 million at the time. Today it is $18 billion. This mining lady took the company towards great success and can be called as the iron ore heiress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Charlene de Carvalho ‚Äì Heineken koopt voor 200 mln euro aandelen bij, en vergroot zo de ademruimte van de brouwer. https://t.co/kW6A3cpY9L pic.twitter.com/0if2j82E75&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;‚Äî Mathijs Smit (@Mathijs__Smit) September 21, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following the family business, Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken is the world‚Äôs 8th richest woman who is the executive director of the world‚Äôs second-largest beer producing company. Charlene inherited 25% from the Heineken International and an additional $4.8 billion after the death of her father. This Dutch-English businesswoman plans on passing on the family business to three of her five children who seem interested in the business. Other than that, what can we say? She‚Äôs rich so yeah, she must be happy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Iris Fontbona&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Estas son las mujeres m√°s ricas d Am√©rica Latina.Iris Fontbona dirige la empresa minera chilena Antofagasta,73 a√±os https://t.co/J0NbUqHzNM pic.twitter.com/1YYsrQqLFu&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;‚Äî Mar√≠a S√°nchez (@mariasan8) March 24, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This rich woman from Chile took over the Luksic Group founded by her husband Andronico Luksic Abaroa after his death. But she did not just inherit it; she made it grow a lot bigger than how her husband had left it. She has risen the ranks to the&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 7th richest woman on the planet. The Luksic Group has investments in mining, finance, industries, and beverages. Iris along with her three sons are running the group successfully for over ten years now. She spends an enormous amount of her money on donations and lives a peaceful life with her sons, much like how her husband‚Äôs last days were.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Yang Huiyan&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yang Huiyan N·ªØ t·ª∑ ph√∫ gi√†u nh·∫•t ch√¢u √Å n√†y hi·ªán m·ªõi ch·ªâ 36 tu·ªïi. pic.twitter.com/OVmlsLsXBo&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;‚Äî Tokyo Nhat (@NhatTokyo) July 27, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far all the rich woman we‚Äôve mentioned took years to build themselves up whether by inheriting the family business or by struggling on their own. But it‚Äôs like Yang Huiyan took a huge shortcut. This woman became the owner of billions when she wasn‚Äôt even thirty! Inheriting 70% of the shares from her father‚Äôs company Country Garden Holdings, Yang Huiyan stands 6th on the list while being one of the youngest billionaires in the world and richest one in entire Asia. Yang Huiyan currently serves as the chairperson of the board‚Äôs governance committee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Laurene Powell Jobs&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Laurene Powell Jobs is using Ronald Reagan in political ads to attack Trump‚Äôs DACA decision https://t.co/i5bGWfZwR4 pic.twitter.com/qy2FsPGwp6&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;‚Äî Paul Lopez (@lopezunwired) September 18, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well everybody loves Apple, and so everybody has loved Steve Jobs.

She is the 5th richest woman in the world, following her husband as among the top richest men worldwide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Susanne Klatten&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wealth of Susanne Klatten, richest person in Germany, is at a 5-year high of $22.2 billionhttps://t.co/xY4aDem3SO pic.twitter.com/qk1XBPTidZ&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;‚Äî BBG Billionaires (@BBGBillionaires) September 15, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shareholder of BMW, Susanne Klatten is the richest woman in Germany, the 38th richest person in the world, and the 4th richest woman on the planet.
