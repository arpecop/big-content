In our justice system, in our political system and especially in our social system. All these systems have the tendency to affect our life one way or another but the double standards that are prevalent in our society is what make these systems so unbearable to live with. After the trendy hashtag of ‘double standards’ took twitter by storm, well the crowd came up with pretty good points and some that just make you wonder why you didn’t think of it before. Here are top 15 tweets that point out double standards in our day to day life:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. The gender dynamics:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;#NowThatsADoubleStandard Woman meeting a man from the internet is most worried about being murdered. Man meeting a woman from the internet is most worried about her being ugly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Joy Sotera (@JoySotera) December 9, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We all know how the concept of a girl who likes to sleep around is referred to as a slut but if a man does it then it is because he’s a man? A funny societal cliché. This really does not give much room for thought why radical feminists do exist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. An interesting twist in dynamics:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Catcalling any woman: sexual harassment. Catcalling a fireman: it’s ok because he’s a male and he’s hot af. #NowThatsADoubleStandard&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Rachem (@BlanketRacheler) December 10, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone may or may not have noticed how objectification works. It is true that women get the worst of it but that does not mean men are completely relieved from this atrocity. This tweet surprisingly points out how harassment towards men is labelled in our society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. The World of television:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When a man flies he&#39;s Superman but when a woman does that she&#39;s a witch #NowThatsADoubleStandard&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Nina (@GirlInHerPJs) December 9, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney might have taught us that girls are Princesses but what do all these Princesses have in common? From Snow white to Sleeping Beauty, they all needed a man to save them, and well the ones who did not need a male figure in their life, we all know what they were called. Again why do people wonder why feminism exists when stuff like this is present in our society in large doses?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. The Irony:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Congress makes laws protecting citizens from sexual harrassment, while overlooking the handsy-ness of their own colleagues. #NowThatsADoubleStandard pic.twitter.com/LlC6D9E66c&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— #HashtagJones (@HashtagJones1) December 9, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There have been many instances when people in your life, who were supposed to be there to protect you end up hurting you instead. Well imagine this scenario on a state level. People who make laws for your own benefit are the ones breaching them instead. This is the epitome of double standards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Here is the society we all know and love:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When cute people ask you out, they&#39;re brave. When not-so-cute people do, they&#39;re creepy. What the hell, planet Earth? #NowThatsADoubleStandard&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— 🐁Silly mouse🐀 (@TheMeituFangirl) December 9, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone was ugly at some point in their life. Some could be ugly before puberty hits them, some could be ugly after. Although why does that matter when everyone is molded from the same clay? It is fine that we all have our preferences but is making other people feel bad about it a part of the protocol?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Back again with the sexism:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No one blinks if men run around unshaven in their skivvies. If women do that, they get some funny looks. #NowThatsADoubleStandard pic.twitter.com/SSy9MH2SZq&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— #HashtagJones (@HashtagJones1) December 9, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shaving can be quite the task and let’s just face it not everyone has time to do it the moment they sprout hair. How come men don’t have to worry about having hair all over their body and when it is a women’s turn she’s ‘gross’ or a ‘she male’. Where is the equality?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Here is a funny one:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;#NowThatsADoubleStandard Woman meeting a man from the internet is most worried about being murdered. Man meeting a woman from the internet is most worried about her being ugly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Joy Sotera (@JoySotera) December 9, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;The priorities of internet dating have started being based on our gender differences. Why are women scared of dating online? Well the moment they meet the guy in person he might be a murderer because well come on that is pretty valid. When it is the guy’s turn to explain why he does not want to date on the internet. “Dude what if she is ugly?” Nice priorities aren’t they?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. One of those twists again:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A woman crying is natural; a man crying is weak.#NowThatsADoubleStandard&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Jimmy (@RandomIgnorance) December 9, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those societal values about men being the support system don’t just put women down but they in their own messed up way belittle the psyche of men as well. Men aren’t allowed to show their emotions in any form unless it’s anger because they are ‘men.’ If they do anything of that sort they get called ‘girlie’ and apparently that is the biggest insult there is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. The ‘Muslims are terrorists’ tirade:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hammering Muslim terrorists but not white supremicist terrorists.#NowThatsADoubleStandard&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— PoliticalFreakshow📎🌈🌊❄️🖖🏽🤖👾 (@PolitiFreakshow) December 9, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Banning Muslim’s because all of them are terrorists might have been the most ridiculous and the most heard of thing you might have witnessed in the last decade but why is no one looking at the other side of the picture? White supremacists are just a few bad apple out of the whole tree because well why not?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Men versus Women yet again:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A guy is in a bad mood and &amp;quot;he has a lot on his mind.&amp;quot;A woman is in a bad mood and &amp;quot;it must be that time of the month.&amp;quot;#NowThatsADoubleStandard pic.twitter.com/QZhEx4bXGQ&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Wiley Coyote (@Fadedessence) December 9, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Women don’t really need to be on that time of the month to be moody. They are allowed to sulk just as much as the next man without bleeding from any orifice of their body. It is high time this stereotypical absurdness end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Here is some form of equality:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Using religion to promote your agenda, and living a life that is anything but…… #NowThatsADoubleStandard pic.twitter.com/5NDq2j2iuc&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Mustang Sally (@KLightenUp) December 9, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is funny how fighting for rights on both ends can bring these two genders together on a really negative loophole yet an equal one in a messed up way. Using an offensive term to label how we don’t want men to act and how we don’t want women to act is the double standards of society at its finest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Say hello to economical margins:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pretending thst immigration is the root cause of white poverty but not raising the minimum wage for 15 years. #NowThatsADoubleStandard&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Angelo Cruz🌈❄️🖖🏽🌊📎👾🤖 (@AngeloCruzTP) December 9, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The joke about immigrants ‘taking’ jobs from white people by settling in their country are becoming overrated, especially is the joke is followed by a white person complaining constantly about it for hours and hours. Do they forget minimum wage jobs really aren’t helping the immigrants build grand mansions and depriving them of one at the same time?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. One of those relationships:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;#NowThatsADoubleStandard&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Expect me to change, but want me to accept you for who you are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Brad W (@idahohioan) December 9, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A lot of people have been there. There being where one partner wants to change them from head to toe but when it is time to return the favor acceptance becomes the key for a good relationship?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. The right of free speech to tell others to hush it:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When people want the right to express their opinion but want to shut others up #NowThatsADoubleStandard&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— 🎄☃️❄️LillySnow❄️☃️🎄 (@fluffykoalaa) December 9, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is rather ironic and funny when people who are known as advocates of free speeches use it to tell other people to that their opinion is worthless and that they basically should not even voice it? Messed up is the right word for this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Dreams are dreams:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Telling me to follow my dreams then getting all huffy about how loud my drum set is. #NowThatsADoubleStandard&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Victoria Veruca Salt (@trumpanzeetamer) December 9, 2017&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Some people might think that the obstacles being thrown in their way are actually challenges to achieve their dreams but what they don’t realize it that the hypocrisies being thrown their way are just hypocrisies and not challenges.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Someone Asked for Examples of Double Standards in Our Society, and Here Are the 15 Best Examples","description":"Want logical proof about the hypocrisy that is currently acting as the big black plague in this world?
