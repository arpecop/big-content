You will be surprised to know that for some stars, the most shocking of secrets are the ones lying around in plain sight. Here are some celebrity’s secrets that you will be shocked to find out!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;22. Kesha&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1035.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikimedia &lt;p&gt;We all know her as the blonde parading around in torn short shorts, before distressed denim was even a thing, obsessing over time while having glitter splattered all over her face. (Tik Tok anyone?) Well looking at her, who would have known that the singer sports an IQ of around of 140, making her a certified genius. After that piece of information, you would think her smartness would reflect in her lyrical content, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;21. Channing Tatum&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1036.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Channing Tatum is famous for both his amazing dance skills and his iconic role in Magic Mike. You can spot this insanely famous and unbelievably cute actor right in the middle of the background of one of Ricky Martin’s songs, named “She Bangs” video. This video is reportedly one of the actor’s very first gigs. He received the amount if $400 for the 5-day shoot and sports some extremely impressive face paint in the video. (Tip: He’s the bartender at exactly the 1:30 mark)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;20. Thomas F. Wilson&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1037.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;While he is undoubtedly best known for terrorizing Michael J. Fox in the Back to the Future trilogy, Thomas F. Wilson actor was actually a self-proclaimed band and drama geek all through high school. He used his own traumatizing experiences in high school of being bullied to help him get into the role. Well this seems to be a perfect example of the bullied becoming the bully!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;19. Christian Bale&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1038.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;While on the promotion trip for Christopher Nolan’s superhero reboot of the iconic Batman Begins, the originally English actor spoke with a heavy American accent in all his interviews. This was owing to the fact that producers were scared that the American public would not be accepting of a Brit playing the much loved caped crusader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;18. Jessica Simpson&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1039.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Jessica Simpson is an American heartthrob by all accounts. However, there is something you probably did not notice about her yet but will do now. Jessica Simpson’s lovely teeth are not great indicators of her weird dental hygiene regime. The singer and actress has admitted to brushing her teeth only around three times a week. Apparently it’s because the actress doesn’t want her teeth “to feel too slippery,” but what matters is that at least she acknowledges that her habit is a little gross. The little might just be a tad understated here, Simpson!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;17. Christopher Lee&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1040.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;By all sorts of worldly narratives, Christopher Lee is an undoubted legend who has managed to pack a lot of remarkable things into his well utilized 93 years on the planet. However, perhaps the most remarkable of them all was what he did during and right after World War II. We are talking about him assisting in tracking down Nazis who had been involved in committing war crimes. What’s more, at one point Lee was apparently linked to the British Special Air Service; it’s something, however, that the late actor refused to speak about, for the operations remained top secret.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;16. Halle Berry&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1041.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;For the uninformed, it might seem like the worst thing in which Halle Berry has ever been involved is 2004’s flop movie Catwoman. Others, though, may argue that this dubious award should be awarded to what happened one day in the midst of February 2000. It was back then that Berry was implicated in a very major traffic accident – one, moreover, after which she allegedly sped away from the scene, making it a classic hit and run. For her dubious actions, the actress was given three years’ probation as well as community service and a fine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15. Johnny Cash&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1042.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Johnny Cash is nothing short of a sheer legend in most aspects, both good and bad. He in fact almost managed to do something that few other people could have even thought of: single-handedly wipe out an entire species of plants. In 1965, the country music legend left a truck ablaze in the middle of the Los Padres National Forest, with the resulting fire spreading to kill around half of the then remaining population of the California condor. Oops. It remains unknown as to why someone would do anything of that sort. However, Cash had to face serious legal repercussions for his actions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. Leighton Meester&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1043.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;This Gossip Girl actress and musician made her way into the world under severely dubious circumstances. The celebrity’s mother was actually serving time in a Texas state federal prison, meaning that Meester was in fact born in a federal prison. Her mother was part of a gigantic drug ring that attempted to smuggle marijuana into the U.S. from Jamaica but was caught in the midst of their efforts. It’s a little-known fact that Leighton Meester was born while her mother was in prison for drug smuggling. Still, the Gossip Girl actress has since stated that, to all intents and purposes, she had a relatively mundane childhood despite a highly inauspicious start to life. Well here’s to knowing that we can’t help our circumstances, but we can help what we make of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. Dr. Dre&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1044.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;After massively successful decades in the biz, Dr. Dre remains a hugely popular musician and producer. However, not many people know of his dark past. Not enough people know about the tale of his assault of female TV presenter Dee Barnes in 1991. After this incident came to light, several other allegations of violence towards women have been made against the rapper as well. For his part, though, Dre has stated that he made “horrible mistakes” in his youth and would in no way do the same again.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;12. Charlize Theron&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1045.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;As barely a teenager, Charlize Theron went through a massive ordeal, She had to go through witnessing her mother kill her abusive father in an act that was subsequently ruled as self-defense. Understandably, the actress doesn’t speak about this element of her past much. However, she has gone ahead on record as saying of the incident, “It’s a part of me, but it doesn’t rule my life.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Jack Nicholson&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1046.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;The truth about Jack Nicholson’s parentage was such a closely guarded secret that even the veteran actor didn’t know about it until he reached adulthood. In fact, it wasn’t until Nicholson was in as late as in his 40s that Time magazine told the star of its findings: the woman whom he thought was his sister was, shockingly, actually his biological mother. Thank God for paparazzi, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Woody Harrelson&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1047.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Woody Harrelson is most known for his memorable role in which he played mass-murdering Mickey Knox in Natural Born Killers. However, unfortunately, he might have been able to research somewhat by talking to his very own father. That’s because of the fact that Charles Harrelson, his father, was himself a real-life hitman – a profession that led to him being handed two life sentences for killing a federal judge in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Joseph Fiennes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1048.jpeg&quot;/&gt; wikipedia &lt;p&gt;This Shakespeare in Love actor went on to portray the most infamous Protestant, Martin Luther, when in fact he was a thoroughly devout Roman Catholic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Simon Cowell&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1049.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;This American Idol judge, infamous for handing out rejections laced with demeaning comments actually had a rocky start to his life. This American Idol meanie got his start in showbiz as a humble runner on Stanley Kubrick’s scary cult classic, named The Shining. Cowell even went as far as to polish the very axe used by Jack Nicholson to bust through the door. Not so high and mighty now, eh Cowell?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Benedict Cumberbatch&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1050.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;In Oscar-winning 2013 drama 12 Years a Slave, Benedict Cumberbatch notably took on the role of slave owner William Prince Ford. It was, though, a part for which he may not have needed to look too far for inspiration. Why? Because a vast majority of the British actor’s distant ancestors were real life slave owners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cumberbatch’s mother even once encouraged him to take on a different stage name for fear of the public hating on him for the acts of his ancestors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Robert Pattinson&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1051.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Robert Pattinson is, it’s fair to say, adored by girls the world over for his role as the flashy yet mysterious vampire Edward Cullen in the Twilight movie franchise. However, these fans might be rather less enthusiastic if they knew how little Pattinson washed his hair. At one point, for example, he let his locks go without shampooing for a staggering six weeks. Eww.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Daniel Radcliffe&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1052.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Like many a child star before him, Daniel Radcliffe has himself admitted to having gone a little off the rails by becoming dependent on booze. The actor even revealed that he’d turned up completely drunk and out of it on the set of Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince and that he can identify scenes in the movie “where [he’s] just gone.” Fortunately for him though, the media never caught any whiff of Radcliffe’s habit at the time, and he has since become completely teetotal. Good for him!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Tobey Maguire&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1053.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;As the extremely popular web-slinging superhero in Spider-Man 2, Tobey Maguire fails to thwart Doc Ock when the bad guy robs a bank. The actor himself, though, may wish that he could have had a say in trying to stop his own dad Vincent from trying the same thing way back in 1993 – something for which the elder Maguire was jailed for a bunch of years. Thankfully, the father and son have since reconciled, and Maguire Sr. has allegedly mended his treacherous ways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Marilyn Monroe&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1054.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Now, this is something undoubtedly hilarious. Marilyn Monroe, while a massive sex symbol, had nothing to do with anything even remotely scholarly. However, she sports an extremely high IQ of 163. This development seems even more shocking in the light of the fact that Einstein, the sure genius, had an IQ of 160. Shocking, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Paris Hilton&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1055.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikipedia &lt;p&gt;Paris Hilton, the heiress to a massive fortune actually has a seriously nasty and surprising habit. According to a vast majority of her bodyguards, Hilton has a shocking tendency to steal things and would go as far as to steal jackets and shoes that she finds unguarded. The more you know!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Tim Allen&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/11/word-image-1056.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Wikimedia     &lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, before the famous Tim Allen was adored for being the voice behind the much loved Buzz Lightyear, he was a drug trafficker. Yes, you heard us right. Not only did he peddle drugs, but he was also caught with more than a staggering 1.43 pounds of pure cocaine at an airport and spent more than two and a half years in prison for this heinous transgression.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"22 Funny Facts That Will Leave You Scratching Your Head","description":"You will be surprised to know that for some stars, the most shocking of secrets are the ones lying around in plain sight."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/3/8adfc5bca5b248be142c52828e547363_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/3/a01fd67dcca5d16fd0770574a6d2bee3_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"7 Destructive Signs Your Relationship Is Moving Too Fast"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/3/85625feaa577c8b2b9e04838d7fd8bc3_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"A Real Wonder Woman Spent 50 Hours Making This Costume from a Cheap Yoga Mat and Duct Tape, and the Result Will Amaze You"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
