Or maybe you feel sluggish and find your brain going hazy at random intervals? We have the perfect solution for you. Logic puzzles have been linked to stimulating brain cells but have also been proven to enhance the human intellectual process significantly. Moreover, solving puzzles leads to increased commitment levels and heightened capacity of psychological endurance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Solving puzzles also leads to a better memory because they require you to remember and reinforce previously forged connections between information, and thus, work to boost the generation of new relationships. Both the remembrance and the formation of new links lead to a greatly enhanced mental speed of thought process. Well, thought out brain puzzles also make people think of different approaches to tackle the same problem. Thinking out of the box while looking for solutions exercises our brains into thinking efficiently when looking for solutions. Puzzles encourage a systematic approach and lead to more innovative problem-solving techniques in the future&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Puzzles have also been linked to actively contributing towards increased production of dopamine, a hormone also known as the ‘happy hormone.’ Moreover, the invigorating effects of puzzles can also help us relax psychologically by moving the brain into a meditative state. All this makes puzzles a great way to tackle stress and induce a general increase in productivity levels, along with a more tranquil and calm state of mine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. The parking spot conundrum&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-01-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;This seemingly easy puzzle was primarily meant for a first graders entrance exam in Hong Kong. While it took kids only a few minutes to solve, most adults seemed to lag behind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Can’t quite seem to get it? Just turn the picture around in your head and wait for the magic to happen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. The 4 digit puzzle&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-02-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;This notoriously hard puzzle takes preschoolers just a few moment to crack while programmers are left scratching their head for hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The answer is deceptively simple! All you really need to do is count the number of circles on every 4 digit number. For instance, the digit 6 has one circle, and 8 has two. According to this logic, 2581 has 2 circles while 6889 has a total of 6.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. The tale of the smart prince&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-03-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;A king of a wealthy land wants his beloved daughter to wed the smartest of 3 incredibly intellectual young princes. This led to the king’s wise courts men devised an intricately designed intelligence test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All three princes are brought together into one room and seated, facing each other. They are then proceeded to be shown two black and three white hats. The princes are then blindfolded, and a single hat is placed on each of their heads, while the remaining hats are taken away and hidden in a separate room.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are then told that the first prince to figure out the color of his hat without removing it or attempting to look at it will get the honor of marrying the princess. However, a wrong guess will merit certain death. The blindfolds are then taken off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You are one of the princes mentioned above, and you see two white hats on the other prince’s heads. A little time passes, and you realize that the other princes are either unable to figure out the color of their hat, or are unwilling to take a wild guess. What is the color of your hat?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a loss for words?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The king, on account of his just character, would stray away from choosing two white hats and one black hat. This would mean that two of the princes would see one black hat and one white hat. This would mean that you would be at a significant disadvantage if you were the only prince wearing a black hat as it would mean the other princes would be able to figure out they were dressed in a white hat. This means that the only way for this test to be fair is for all three princes to wear a white hat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. The numerical pyramid&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-04-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Third graders in Singapore are rumored to be able to solve such puzzles in less than two minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The answering values of D and E are 1345 and 2440 respectively. The bottom of the numbers is connected to the top tier, but you need to figure out their connection. Add the numbers on the bottom, and you get 461, which is greater by 15 from its neighbor 446. That’s when you realize that 15 is the magic number here with 15 always being the leftover when you subtract the sum from the neighboring number.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. The chocolate dilemma&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-05-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;This problem is from a particularly tricky 12-year-old American student’s worksheet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are 50 chocolate sweets in the box. 30 of these candies come with a caramel center, 25 have coconut filling, and 10 of them have both caramel and coconut, while the rest of the sweets are plain chocolate candies with no filling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Question: Which of the following diagrams reflects the box of chocolates accurately?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The answer lies in pure mathematics with the correct option being B. To find out how many caramel candies are in the box; you need to 30 — 10 = 20. For coconut candies do 25 — 10 = 15. Now you can easily figure out how many plain chocolate candies are present in the box! 50 — (20 + 15 +10) = 5&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6.The question of the bus&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-06-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Which way is this bus facing while driving?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basic driving knowledge can get you far in solving this one. The bus can be said to be moving towards the left because the doors are located on the other side of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. How is this even possible?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-07-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;To find the underlying cause of solving this puzzle, all you’ll need to do is to imagine the number 29 in Roman digits. That way, it’ll look like XXIX. Now all you need to do is you simply removing I and get XXX, which, in the Arabic system, means 30.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Trouble in Paradise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-08-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Abel and Bella have fallen in love via the big bad internet, and now Abel wants to mail her a ring to propose. Unfortunately, the country they live in is called Kleptopia and everything that is sent through the mail will be stolen unless they mail it in an enclosed box. Abel and Bella each have plenty of padlocks on their own, however, none to which the other could have a key. How can Abel get the ring safely into Bella’s hands?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Abel sends Bella a box with the ring in it and affixes one of his padlocks on it. Upon receiving the box, Bella attaches her padlock to the same box and mails it back to Abel, this time with both padlocks on it. When Abel gets it back, he removes his lock and sends the box back to Bella with only her latch in place. The package is both safe and can be opened by Bella. However, all this back and forth action makes it seem like a simple visit would have serves the purpose better!&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;9. The escaped convict&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-09-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;The Police seek the help of a detective to find a prisoner who has escaped from jail. The detective manages to narrow his search down to one of three different houses. After taking a closer look at an aerial photo of all three houses, the detective claims that he can tell which house the prisoner was staying at.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you know how?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The prisoner must have been hiding in house A as this is the only house in the picture where the car is turned towards the street for a quick escape.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Spotting the odd one out&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-10-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;At first, you might feel like the only odd shape here is the bright green one but wait till you play close attention to all the other options. What about the lonely circle in the middle or is it the only shape without a border? The only way out of these puzzles is to eliminate the options one by one until only one shape is left, which will be your answer. The leftmost shape is special because it does not have any unique attributes. Talk about mixed signals!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;11. Which picture should replace the question mark&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-11-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;The correct answer for this puzzle would be the first figure. All the figures given in the picture represent numbers along with their mirror images attached. If you can grasp the motivation behind the puzzle, you’ll have no difficulty in calculating the sum of 1 and 3.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;12. How much does the egg cost?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-12-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;The infamous egg and chicken problem. The cost of the chicken is 100 coins more expensive than the egg. How much does the egg cost? By pure mathematics, the egg costs four coins and the chicken 104 coins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;13. The Faulty Dice&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-13-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;A die on the bottom left corner of the picture can be seen sporting seven spots instead of the standard 6. That would make for a weird gamble!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;14. Fill in the missing numbers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-14-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;The correct answer for this problem is 10. If you really look into the mechanics behind the problem, you realize that the difference between the adjoining numbers increases linearly by 1 with every other number. The difference between 7 and 5 is two while the difference between 5 and 8 is 3, and so on. This means that the difference between 3 and the next number should be 7, making the number to be replaced by 10.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;15.

Cheryl’s Birthday Diva problem&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-16-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;msn &lt;p&gt;What started out as an unsuspecting quiz question for fifth graders turned overnight into a puzzle that single-handedly conquered the world as probably the hardest elementary school question ever to exist. With a mixture of conditions that had to cancel out over several tiers, the answer eventually came to 16 July after some extreme heckling by math experts. Here’s one for 5th graders to remember.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;17. Can you divide this shape into six equal parts?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-17-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;While it might seem daunting, the task of equally dividing it into six portions isn’t as hard as it seems as long as you’re willing to get a little creative with the shape.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;18. Be there or be squared&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-18-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com &lt;p&gt;Create gravy of squares, and that’s exactly how you come to create a quiz like this. Based on an exercise focused on counting squares, this particular dolly required some arduous paperwork as squares of all dimensions and lengths popped into view with time. A real heckler for sure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;19. The pentagonal problem&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/09/d-drafting-25-9-2181-2181-19-jpg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Tapoos.com     &lt;p&gt;Every once in awhile we are faced with a deceptively simple puzzle that entire boxes of pencils and school years go wasted on. This pentagon envelope was the culprit of the said crimes for years as it began a feud where some people could solve it instantly, while some took ages to even get through the first part only to be faced with bigger hurdles ahead. The three rules are relatively simple. Your pen can’t lift off the paper so the drawing must be continuous, you can’t cross lines and can’t overlap on already drawn portions. Go figure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"19 Mind Bending Logic Puzzles Kids Can Solve Easily","description":"Logic puzzles have been linked to stimulating brain cells but have also been proven to enhance the human intellectual process significantly."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/3/c3248af9e3d58962900b521f69ee35b3_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/3/cd3e9fe9d031ac5bf140031dd80f2c83_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Someone Asked for Examples of Double Standards in Our Society, and Here Are the 15 Best Examples"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/3/c28bb038d38f9ea80998181c25540773_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Top 6 DEADLIEST Roller Coasters YOU WONT BELIEVE EXIST!
