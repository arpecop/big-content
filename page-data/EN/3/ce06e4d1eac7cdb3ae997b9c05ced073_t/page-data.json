Depilation creams&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-200.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Yes that’s right! The one thing that they actually tell you to apply down there tops our list of items. There is a whole multi-billion dollar industry based on depilation creams and gels and we are bombarded with numerous advertisements telling us to use them for hair removal. But they are actually harmful for you and most importantly, for your lady parts below. These creams are full of strong chemicals (most even have that chemical-ly smell) and can cause severe allergic reactions and rashes. Even those especially for sensitive skin can have adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A woman in Manhattan, NY, sued the makers of Veet hair-removal cream claiming she got third-degree burns when she went to the beach after using the product.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Depilatories work by dissolving hair with chemicals such as calcium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. The combination of these two main active ingredients creates a potent chemical mixture that can burn if left too long on the skin. They can also cause skin irritation which can vary from a mild tingling or burning sensation to the appearance of a rash (chemical dermatitis). Brands like Veet and Nair are FDA-approved, but come with warnings because the chemicals in them are extremely strong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Glitter bombs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-201.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Apparently, that’s quite a rage these days! You may want to glitter like a unicorn all over, but when it comes to your sensitive areas, its best to steer clear of this trend. Glitter is usually made of two things: plastic or sugar. For both these items, it is never a good idea to put them down there. These glitter bombs are very popular and Passion Dust made them more famous by selling out their stock within a few days of launching them. However, they have grave side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Dr. Jen Gunter, a Canadian gynecologist, says they are bound to lead to a dangerous infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Vanessa Mackay, spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in the UK, said: “The vagina contains a delicate balance of good bacteria, which are there to protect it. If women place foreign objects inside their vagina, their risk disturbing this balance which may lead to infection, such as bacterial vaginosis or thrush, and inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Tea Tree Oil&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-202.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;The magic oil that created quite a buzz recently and became famous for its healing properties. Tea tree, also known as melaleuca, is well-known for its powerful antiseptic properties and ability to treat wounds. Tea tree oil (TTO), the volatile essential oil derived mainly from the Australian native plant &lt;em&gt;Melaleuca alternifolia&lt;/em&gt; has been widely used throughout Australia for at least the past 100 years. And for over seven decades, it’s been documented in numerous medical studies to kill many strains of bacteria, viruses and fungi.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, if you are using oil for your lady bits, you should refrain from using tea tree oil. According to Dr. Raquel Dardik, M.D., a gynecologist and Associate Professor of Gynecology at NYU Langone Medical Center, “you want to use oil that is pH neutral, so for example, almond oil, coconut oil, olive oil, probably okay.” What you don’t want to use is tea tree oil, which can cause scary chemical burns: “it’s incredibly caustic and will cause a vaginal burn, so probably not okay.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even dipping a tampon in tea tree oil and inserting it inside before bedtime is not a good idea. Your whoo-ha is a very sensitive area, and there are risks of irritation when using this method. It might result in potential burns and you might feel extreme discomfort and pain as a result.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Douche&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-203.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;This is a complete no-no. There is medically no reason to use a douche to clean yourself as your vagina is self-cleaning. In fact using douches can be harmful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Douches create imbalance in your pH levels and mess up that perfect, natural mixture of good bacteria, leaving you at a much higher risk of getting a yeast infection if you use them. But the risks do not end here. The most serious risk that douches have is of increasing your likelihood of contracting pelvic inflammatory disease by a huge 73 percent. Even the CDC lists douches as a potential reason for this disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to WebMD, using douches may make it more difficult to get pregnant and also increase the chances of an ectopic pregnancy by 76%. In an ectopic pregnancy, the embryo implants outside the uterus. This should be enough reason to leave this method and let your natural self-cleaning part take over the job of keeping you clean.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Dyes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-204.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;You might have thought of trying to dye down there if you are feeling a bit adventurous, but we suggest otherwise. Dyes contain toxic ingredients and can cause skin irritation and allergies. Leave them on for longer than necessary, and the harsh ingredients can even cause skin burns. They have been found to have major implications for women who use dyes frequently and have been linked to cancer. And if you don’t want to trust us, you can follow the advice of Dr Manuela Gago-Dominguez. He has conducted a series of studies on bladder patients and healthy women who were all of the same age and found a link between bladder cancer and hair dye.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Dr Manuela Gago-Dominguez said: ‘Our novel observations are provocative and carry enormous public health implications. This is one of the largest and most comprehensive studies ever conducted on the issue and we think our results should not be ignored.’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t think you need a more concrete reason to stop using dyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Tattoos&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-205.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Although it may sound like common sense to not have permanent tattoos on a sensitive part, you would be surprised how many people actually go for it. The most sensitive skin is between your legs. Tattoos cause immense pain and redness when applied anywhere on the body. Tattoos contain dyes and pigments which are inserted into the skin to make a permanent pattern. These dyes can cause skin allergies and reactions. Your skin is also punctured during the tattoo application process and that can lead to major infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even the Food and Drug Administration has become more involved with tattoo inks. They state that “Many pigments used in tattoo inks are industrial-grade colors suitable for printers’ ink or automobile paint.” Following the example of studies started overseas, the FDA is now examining the chemical composition of inks and pigments and how they break down in the body, as well their short- and long-term safety.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Dirty underwear&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-206.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;This should actually need not to have been said. But alas, many people get yeast infections only due to dirty underwear. While you may best know your lifestyle, yet it is for hygienic factors that it is recommended to change dirty clothes immediately. This applies especially to workout clothes as they can harbor sweat and germs. This sweat and germs is what teams up to cause infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though the vaginal canal is self-cleaning, please don’t bank on it much. This is because this doesn’t apply to our external genitalia, therefore it needs to be washed thoroughly. However, even if you clean yourself, not changing into fresh undies is actually bad for you. This is due to the fact that the bacteria and traces of discharge from undies you wore the previous day can get smelly. Apart from the foul odor you can give off, it is also found that there is one-tenth of a gram of fecal matter in most people’s underwear. Thus, better to change your undies often!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Synthetic fabrics&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-207.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;While we are on the subject of underwear, let’s also discuss one more thing to keep away from your lady parts. Underwear that is made from synthetic material like polyester. This is because your v-jay needs to breathe. And it cannot do so in synthetic fabrics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You might have a personal preference in the sort of underwear you like to wear, however choosing natural materials is always the best option. Not only are they usually less expensive, they also are more comfortable for day-long wear. Dr Moore says that “Silk and synthetic fabrics are not breathable, which increases the risk of moisture being trapped and retained, which can create a yeast or bacterial infection.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Harsh detergents&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-208.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Now, we may have talked a lot about keeping dirty underwear away from your hoo-ha, but how do you actually keep your undies clean. By washing them, duh!, you say. Yes, you are right. But here we stress that washing them with non-hypoallergenic detergent is of utmost importance. Dr. Moore impresses upon us that “A common irritation is a form of contact dermatitis and the number one cause of that is your laundry detergent. The tissues that your panties come in to contact with are a lot more sensitive than your elbows.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Therefore it is important that you read the label carefully the next time you are buying detergents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Hard bike seats&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-209.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;You may have experienced that numbness that comes down there after biking at the gym or out in the park. This is because Bikes that have hard seats put pressure down there. Even though the numbness may go after a while, yet it is something that is best avoided, if possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hard seats reduce circulation down there and cause your blood supply to reduce. The word for it is ‘saddle-soreness’. If you experience it frequently and for longer periods of time, it may cause the overall sensitivity in that area to be reduced. You can avoid this by buying cushioned seats or adjusting your bike handles to relive some pressure off your hips.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Steam&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://thechangepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/word-image-210.jpeg&quot;/&gt;via shutterstock &lt;p&gt;Ahh that feeling of being cleansed out that you get after a good day at the spa. Those steamy baths and hot oil treatments. While these may sound heavenly and good for your body overall, they are definitely bad for your lady parts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yoni steaming is an old health practice whereby a woman squats or sits over steaming water containing herbs such as mugworth, rosemary, wormwood and basil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though Gwyneth Paltrow, a consciously uncoupled actress and self-professed lifestyle expert, has made it a trend, Ob-Gyns have major concerns regarding this practice. “There is no scientific evidence that shows it works,” said Dr. Draion Burch (who goes by Dr. Drai for media appearances), an ob-gyn in Pittsburgh. Moreover, steaming your nether regions could even lead to unpleasant side effect&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;As we have been stressing through, a consciously uncoupled actress and self-professed lifestyle expert out, your lady bit is a self-cleaning canal. Therefore, steaming down there is completely unnecessary. Apart from this, it is also known that steaming can also cause burns and discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"11 Things to Keep Away from Your Lady Parts","description":"Things that you must never apply or use near or on your lady parts"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/3/ce06e4d1eac7cdb3ae997b9c05ced073_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/3/d1176c92d711983afe9966703aec5773_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"18 Ways to Soothe a Sore Vagina"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/3/cd3e9fe9d031ac5bf140031dd80f2c83_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Someone Asked for Examples of Double Standards in Our Society, and Here Are the 15 Best Examples"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
