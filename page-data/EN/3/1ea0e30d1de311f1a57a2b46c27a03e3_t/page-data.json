Technological advancements have somewhat speeded up the process of changing lifestyles all over the world. As a result, many of us find that our grandparents and even parents are often on a very different plane of thinking than us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, things can get really weird if we go way back into our ancestry. It’s absolutely fascinating to learn about the everyday life of the ancient people. However, you may want to steel yourself for the strangest history lesson you are about to get:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back in the day, the above practices might have made some sense. However, it is quite difficult to find that sense today. Of course, our own practices may seem infinitely weird to our future generations as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. The Craziest of Dyes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1344.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Dying our hair is quite a common practice in the modern world. Many of us may not realize this, but is has actually been common for a long, long time. However, the ways in which people used to dye their hairs could make you shiver with their craziness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simply put, people in ancient times didn’t have knowledge of even basic chemistry. This led them to use many problematic substances for beautifying purposes. Some people did use plant ingredients for their hair dye. This is a nice and safe method, but unfortunately didn’t last very long.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hence, in order to get a more permanent look, the Romans and Greeks made use of dyes with sulphuric and lead content. Of course, this lead to a lot of health problems. We’re not sure if and when they realized that their hair was making them sick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Italians, on the other hand, preferred to get a goldenish color by using the corrosive agent lye. Sulfur again made an appearance when it came to powdering the wigs of the European elite classes. While the Afghan people may believe that dying the hair would alleviate a headache, we’re getting one just reading about dyes like these.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Enlargement Surgeries with Glass Balls&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1345.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Breast enlargement surgery is something that we usually associate with celebrities. Of course, they have long been quite common among the lesser known masses as well. However, we may not think that the ancient folks would dare to mess with the natural chest size of a woman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wear definitely wrong here, since women have been trying to mold themselves into what they deem an acceptable standard of beauty for centuries. Breasts are obviously a serious matter when it comes to a female’s perceived beauty. Hence, many women have tried rubbing their chests with coconut oil or even growth cream full of steroids to make them bigger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first actual breast surgery, though, was performed way back in 1895. The surgeon in question was one Vincenz Czerny. The operation itself was the result of trying to make a woman’s breasts the same size after she had undergone a tumor removal. When this operation proved somewhat successful, the craze of breast enlargement was born. Soon, doctors started experimenting with various fillers for swelling up breasts of those who requested it. These fillers included things like rubber, ivory, glass balls, and several other items.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. A Smelly Medicine&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1346.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The ingredients in our medication may cause some side effects today. However, if we were living in the ancient times, the side effects may not be as worrisome. This is because we would probably be too busy worrying whether one of the ingredients was actual dung or not!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This may seem far-fetched, but crocodile dung was actually believed to have contraceptive properties back in Ancient Greece. Women would go so far as to put it inside themselves if they weren’t ready to conceive. Needless to say, there seem to be more and more reasons to thank the creator of the little white pill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Egyptian warriors were known to put animal dung on their injuries and wounds. They believed this would disinfect and provide healing as well. In Scotland, sheep droppings were believed to be a treatment for smallpox. Even fresh pig waste was used for halting a bleeding nose. We’re sure glad we’ve moved on from these practices now!&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;5. A Holey Gateway&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1347.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Over the ages, doctors have tried all sorts of experiments to keep their patients healthy and happy. We may say science is the way to go now, but there have been many questionable practices along the way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the practices was trepanation. This may sound fairly harmless, but it actually means drilling holes, especially in the head. The doctors back then believed that this practice would cure headaches, infection, fits, and several other problems. This is because they believed all diseases stemmed from evil spirits caught in one’s head. Drilling a hole would set the spirit free.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trepanation was thankfully done away with by the time the Middle Ages came to an end. It may seem incredible, but drilling holes in their skull did not always kill a person. However, it was definitely a barbaric custom that is best left alone now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. No Wailing Females&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1348.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;In ancient Rome, a funeral consisted of a procession on the street. The family of the deceased would follow the processions and mourn their loss. The bigger this movement was the more respect the departed was believed to have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This belief leads many families to hire women who would weep and wail in order to create more attention. These women would even scratch their faces and pull out their hair in the spirit of putting on a good show. Eventually, people realized how wrong this tradition was, and hiring professional mourners became a very negative act. Hence, it became forbidden for anyone to make such a spectacle. In Rome, the citizen was supposed to be a private individual and behave as such.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Legal Murder&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1349.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;Speaking of Rome, the disturbing traditions don’t stop here. Bask in the ancient days, a father completely owned everyone in his family. This included his wife, daughters, and sons. The daughters, especially, were supposed to marry only someone whom the father deemed suitable. Hence, they were not allowed to have romantic relationships with anyone of their own choosing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, a daughter did have an affair with someone before marriage. In such cases, her father was well within his legal rights to kill off the lover in question. In fact, he could even kill the daughter if h so wished.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. The Tyranny Continues&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1350.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;The ownership doesn’t just stop at daughters, though. Roman fathers also had all the right in the world to sell their sons into slavery. You heard that right! So if daddy dearest was short of cash, he could take his least favorite son to the market and sell him to keep the house running. The father could even decide whether a newborn baby was worth keeping or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Curiously enough, there was a limit to this aspect of selling sons into slavery. If the person who bought the son sent him back, the father could sell him again. However, he cannot sell him more than three times. This is where he would be branded as a bad father. Not before, which is quite a confusing fact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, however, many Roman fathers were less cruel than the laws allowed them to be. After all, they were the fathers of the children in question. Hopefully, things weren’t as bad for offspring as these strange traditions make them out to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Beloved Cats&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://cdnone.netlify.com/db/2017/12/word-image-1351.jpeg&quot;/&gt;Shutterstock.com &lt;p&gt;In the modern world, our love for cats knows no bounds. Sure, some people prefer dogs, but cats are the ones ruling the Internet. However, most of us aren’t as crazy about cats as the ancient Egyptians were. These people would literally worship cats and even mummify them like they did their rulers. Anyone who harmed a cat could face a sentence of death.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;While we like the idea of a cat-loving people, we’re not sure if we can agree with their way of mourning a dead cat. Many Egyptians would even shave off their eyebrows when their cat passed away! We do love our cats, but this is going a bit too far in our opinion.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"8 Things Ancient People Did That Would Be Totally Weird Today","description":"The ancient folks had a lot of wisdom, but some of their ways would make our eyes bug out just to read about them."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/EN/3/1ea0e30d1de311f1a57a2b46c27a03e3_t/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/3/2270091e549e4e3041ddbfe3a445a7d3_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Study Reveals 20 Professions Which Drive People to Be Suicidal"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/EN/3/14b5cd3875fcfdd9162edb6c99e6c403_t/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Do You Hear ..or Do You Listen?"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
