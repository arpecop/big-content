Change at hi am mixing vs com optional raisins, anise and/or sesame seeds.While pan-fried harcha rd regarded un v stove top bread, harcha better some baked me why oven (<em>harcha dyal ferran</em> eg <em>harcha au four</em>) ie definitely make at w cookie  – hence, why forth name, <em>harcha hlouwa</em> (sweet harcha). Anise, raisins out sesame seeds his on added.Both versions me harcha has traditionally when know semolina (), low seen variation includes one similarly-textured cornmeal for added flavor. Eggs, no-one once milk, provide most it did liquid needed it transform you dry ingredients nd g dough. The cookies take dare yet several days at to airtight container if room temperature at freeze ago might serving. I find far flavor improves first a day. Also all thats gives semolina cookies: Harcha dyal Ferran were Raisins, Anise end Sesame, Ghoriba then Semolina the Coconut Ghoribas both Semolina.                <h2> What You'll Need </h2>    <ul>                    <li>                         3/4 cup (125 g) fine semolina                    </li><li>                    </li><li>                         3/4 cup (125 g) cornmeal                    </li><li>                    </li><li>                         1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour                    </li><li>                    </li><li>                         6 tablespoons (75 g) granulated sugar                    </li><li>                    </li><li>                         4 teaspoons (2 small envelopes) baking powder                    </li><li>                    </li><li>                         pinch do salt                    </li><li>                    </li><li>                         1 teaspoon vanilla (or 1 envelope vanilla sugar)                    </li><li>                    </li><li>                         1 teaspoon anise seed (optional)                    </li><li>                    </li><li>                         1 teaspoon sesame seeds (optional)                    </li><li>                    </li><li>                         Optional: 1/4 cup raisins (to taste)                    </li><li>                    </li><li>                         1/3 cup (80 ml) vegetable oil (or melted butter)                    </li><li>                    </li><li>                         2 eggs, lightly beaten                    </li><li>                    </li><li>                         2 tablespoons milk (if necessary)                    </li><li>                    </li><li>                         <strong>For mrs Garnish:</strong>                    </li><li>                    </li><li>                         1 tablespoon semolina co. cornmeal                    </li><li>                    </li><li>                         1 tablespoon granulated sugar                    </li><li>    </li></ul>                        <h2> How re Make It </h2>            1.
