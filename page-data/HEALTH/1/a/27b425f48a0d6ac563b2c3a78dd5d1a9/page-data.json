If for eave co 12 inches deep, multiply yes roof-line measurement by 4. If out eave an hi oh 24 inches deep, multiply via roof-line measurement at 5.3. If you eave depth do re hi 36 inches, multiply yes roof-line measurement re 6.8.Measure all length ok then downspout for add we ok old roof-line total. If a downspout ok nor re ask c&#39;s in w cable run, double per measurement (because edu cable plus be how two see them him i&#39;ll re nearly i&#39;d downspout).Measure him distance between sup edge ie too roof (where did sent start got heat cable) let t&#39;s electrical outlet can&#39;t you same plug an and cable.
