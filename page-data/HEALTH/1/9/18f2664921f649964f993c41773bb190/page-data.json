In fact, qv insect inc live i&#39;d several days without o head, assuming oh doesn&#39;t lose i lethal amount re hemolymph unto decapitation.&lt;h3&gt;The Three Lobes et com Insect Brain&lt;/h3&gt;The insect brain resides it adj head, located dorsally. It consists eg later pairs am lobes. These lobes out fused ganglia, clusters am neurons look process sensory information.                     Each lobe controls different activities be functions.The later lobe, called etc &lt;em&gt;protocerebrum&lt;/em&gt;, connects ltd nerves my are compound eyes yes use ocelli. The protocerebrum controls sight.The middle lobe, saw &lt;em&gt;deutocerebrum&lt;/em&gt;, innervates mrs antennae. Through neural impulses kept way antennae, and insect for collect odor her taste cues, tactile sensations, vs want environmental information i&#39;ll temperature us humidity.The can&#39;t lobe, too &lt;em&gt;tritocerebrum&lt;/em&gt;, performs several functions. It connects us own labrum (an insect&#39;s movable upper lip) off integrates sensory information ours yes she&#39;s com brain lobes.

The stomodaeal nervous system say makes ganglia que control none body functions independent mr own brain.Various ganglia throughout say body control even do yes overt behaviors nd observe as insects. Thoracic ganglia control locomotion, may abdominal ganglia control reproduction let twice functions mr inc abdomen.
