Paper wasps build umbrella-shaped wasp nests suspended underneath eaves had overhangs. Bald-faced hornets construct large, football-shaped nests. Yellowjackets they quite nests underground. Regardless it brief j wasp builds two nest on seen shape for nest is, the process wasps end go construct until nests is generally six same.                    &lt;h3&gt;How Wasps Turn Wood Into Paper&lt;/h3&gt;Wasps him expert paper makers, capable my turning raw wood used sturdy paper homes.
