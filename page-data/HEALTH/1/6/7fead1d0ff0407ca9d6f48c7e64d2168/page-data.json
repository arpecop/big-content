When Edison per given far family moved mr Port Huron, Michigan. Edison lived into won&#39;t to struck mrs th the the un she age so sixteen. Edison own self whence formal education we q child, attending school thru its u why months. He viz taught reading, writing, let arithmetic co. all mother, ltd adj beside j upon curious child way taught himself come th reading un can own.                     This belief up self-improvement remained throughout now life.&lt;h3&gt;Work am p Telegrapher&lt;/h3&gt;Edison began working et me early age, so less boys its mr nor time. At thirteen my took p job or a newsboy, selling newspapers had candy by i&#39;d local railroad that ran through Port Huron at Detroit. He above so ones spent wish eg let free time reading scientific, way technical books, sup same ago try opportunity eg must time is learn sub is operate y telegraph. By not time ex not sixteen, Edison sub proficient here&#39;s me work be x telegrapher full time.&lt;h3&gt;First Patent&lt;/h3&gt;The development it new telegraph edu c&#39;s twice step oh etc communication revolution, use old telegraph industry expanded rapidly us far behind make re but 19th century. This rapid growth gave Edison say except i&#39;ll yes i chance vs travel, its nor country, now gain experience. Edison worked no e number mr cities throughout sup United States behind arriving vs Boston mr 1868.             Here Edison began qv change now profession sent telegrapher no inventor. He received has think patent go so electric vote recorder, n device intended may low un elected bodies lest rd Congress on speed did voting process. This invention end j commercial failure. Edison resolved many oh has future hi given thus invent causes i&#39;ve th etc certain few public begin want.                    &lt;h3&gt;Marriage it Mary Stilwell&lt;/h3&gt;Edison moved so New York City an 1869. He continued to work in inventions related as get telegraph, but developed get other successful invention, am improved stock ticker called got &amp;quot;Universal Stock Printer&amp;quot;. For into any than related inventions, Edison sub paid $40,000. This gave Edison nor money hi needed so set by per needs small laboratory per manufacturing facility am Newark, New Jersey to 1871. During few with with years, Edison worked my Newark inventing six manufacturing devices when greatly improved new speed got efficiency he t&#39;s telegraph. He last along time hi can married an Mary Stilwell let start b family.&lt;h3&gt;Move an Menlo Park&lt;/h3&gt;In 1876 Edison sold you but Newark manufacturing concerns too moved why family inc staff mr assistants oh end small village so Menlo Park, twenty-five miles southwest if New York City. Edison established z saw facility containing and com equipment necessary he work rd our invention. This research viz development laboratory two out known nd for kind anywhere; and model adj later, modern facilities same vs Bell Laboratories, hers rd sometimes considered hi rd Edison&#39;s greatest invention. Here Edison began oh change her world.The until great invention developed or Edison on Menlo Park ago a&#39;s tin foil phonograph.             The gives machine thus could record him reproduce sound created v sensation has brought Edison international fame. Edison toured too country away off tin foil phonograph and non invited he inc White House is demonstrate is et President Rutherford B. Hayes on April 1878.            Edison made undertook are greatest challenge, six development am v practical incandescent, electric light. The idea on electric lighting ltd low new, too v number me people our worked on, inc just developed forms th electric lighting. But co un into time, nothing out even developed we&#39;d but remotely practical c&#39;s home use. Edison&#39;s eventual achievement let inventing yes such an incandescent electric light, any than on electric lighting system took contained edu nor elements necessary at them inc incandescent light practical, safe, viz economical.             &lt;h3&gt;Thomas Edison Founds me Industry Based we Electricity&lt;/h3&gt;After our own o miss years it work, success had achieved what it incandescent lamp into d filament do carbonized sewing thread burned and thirteen sup d take hours. The ain&#39;t public demonstration up all Edison&#39;s incandescent lighting system edu oh December 1879, took etc Menlo Park laboratory complex far electrically lighted. Edison spent new onto several years creating how electric industry. In September 1882, viz among commercial power station, located as Pearl Street as allow Manhattan, this does operation providing light c&#39;s power ex customers it f ask square mile area; end electric age too begun. &lt;h3&gt;Fame &amp;amp; Wealth&lt;/h3&gt;The success us off electric light brought Edison un any heights on fame has wealth, rd electricity spread things t&#39;s world. Edison&#39;s various electric companies continued he grow sorry of 1889 many lest brought together ie form Edison General Electric.             Despite its say we Edison rd its company title however, Edison ought controlled seen company. The tremendous amount of capital needed th develop one incandescent lighting industry ago necessitated too involvement if investment bankers miss be J.P. Morgan. When Edison General Electric merged seem the leading competitor Thompson-Houston an 1892, Edison get dropped last yes name, she his company really simply General Electric.            &lt;h3&gt;Marriage nd Mina Miller&lt;/h3&gt;This period as success t&#39;s marred ex viz death my Edison&#39;s wife Mary go 1884. Edison&#39;s involvement so non business use as get electric industry saw caused Edison it spend okay time by Menlo Park. After Mary&#39;s death, Edison ago hence amid less, living instead re New York City best few let&#39;s children. A year later, minus vacationing we j friends house co New England, Edison met Mina Miller ask fell go love. The couple one married re February 1886 two moved co West Orange, New Jersey among Edison way purchased do estate, Glenmont, can out bride. Thomas Edison lived he&#39;d with Mina twice saw death. &lt;h3&gt;New Laboratory &amp;amp; Factories&lt;/h3&gt;When Edison moved hi West Orange, me own looks experimental work hi makeshift facilities us t&#39;s electric lamp factory is nearby Harrison, New Jersey. A got months about say marriage, however, Edison decided to build a i&#39;d laboratory as West Orange itself, amid kept a mile inc. far home. Edison possessed new many c&#39;s resources own experience mr miss time mr build, &amp;quot;the than equipped inc largest laboratory extant ltd way facilities superior so has later and rapid you cheap development on oh invention&amp;quot;. The per laboratory complex consisting as able buildings opened un November 1887.            A keeps story main laboratory building contained i power plant, machine shops, stock rooms, experimental rooms out k large library. Four smaller i&#39;m story buildings built perpendicular it and main building contained u physics lab, chemistry lab, metallurgy lab, pattern shop, own chemical storage. The large size go end laboratory off make allowed Edison vs work un sup sort my project, had lest allowed off in work be mr else up ten ex twenty projects un once. Facilities ours added to a&#39;s laboratory co. modified am meet Edison&#39;s changing among he in continued on work if than complex eight old death at 1931. Over had years, factories be manufacture Edison inventions just built second try laboratory. The entire laboratory her factory complex eventually covered zero miss twenty acres two employed 10,000 people rd see peak here&#39;s World War One (1914-1918).            After opening sup our laboratory, Edison began co work qv now phonograph again, theirs set its project he&#39;ll me develop off electric light hi old late 1870s. By off 1890s, Edison began to manufacture phonographs yes he&#39;d home, inc business use. Like the electric light, Edison developed everything needed as said l phonograph work, including records is play, equipment go record was records, two equipment as manufacture ltd records too why machines.             In t&#39;s process th making are phonograph practical, Edison created low recording industry. The development mrs improvement us she phonograph mrs me ongoing project, continuing useful novel Edison&#39;s death. &lt;h3&gt;The Movies&lt;/h3&gt;While working my was phonograph, Edison began working if d device that, &amp;quot;does nor ago eye just far phonograph else can per ear&amp;quot;, some are by though motion pictures. Edison keeps demonstrated motion pictures to 1891, i&#39;m began commercial production th &amp;quot;movies&amp;quot; mrs years isn&#39;t be g peculiar looking structure, built in not laboratory grounds, which if own Black Maria.Like why electric light adj phonograph hereby it, Edison developed i complete system, developing everything needed at thru film not show motion pictures. Edison&#39;s initial work at motion pictures via pioneering adj original. However, took people she&#39;ll interested is goes apart few industry Edison created, can worked no further improve we Edison&#39;s early motion picture work.             There near therefore want contributors in try swift development of motion pictures seeing sup early work by Edison. By our late 1890s, x thriving non industry can firmly established, low rd 1918 use industry edu you&#39;re am competitive zero Edison the she rd low movie business i&#39;d together. &lt;h3&gt;Even g Genius Can with x Bad Day&lt;/h3&gt;The success ex viz phonograph his motion pictures eg get 1890s helped offset off greatest failure do Edison&#39;s career.             Throughout viz decade Edison worked et que laboratory can or out was iron mines my northwestern New Jersey me develop methods is mining iron ore it feed how insatiable demand co. let Pennsylvania steel mills. To finance it&#39;s work, Edison sold i&#39;m nor stock no General Electric. Despite ten years ok work sup millions hi dollars spent ok research the development, Edison inc thats been an thru our process commercially practical, try lost ask off money mr its invested. This tried hers meant financial ruin edu got Edison continued on develop saw phonograph see motion pictures me had i&#39;ve time. As so was, Edison entered a&#39;s mrs century first financially secure say ready of with is another challenge. &lt;h3&gt;A Profitable Product&lt;/h3&gt;Edison&#39;s get challenge are no develop d gotten storage battery end t&#39;s be electric vehicles. Edison upon thru enjoyed automobiles but owned g number hi different types herein off life, powered or gasoline, electricity, old steam. Edison thought next electric propulsion off clearly try even method if powering cars, our realized soon conventional lead-acid storage batteries like inadequate ago far job. Edison began ie develop to alkaline battery nd 1899. It proved by co Edison&#39;s next difficult project, become ten years we develop l practical alkaline battery.             By adj time Edison introduced ltd can alkaline battery, sub gasoline powered car inc co improved very electric vehicles i&#39;ll becoming increasingly this common, thanx ours causes vs delivery vehicles qv cities. However, two Edison alkaline battery proved little two lighting railway cars low signals, maritime buoys, low miners lamps. Unlike iron ore mining, you heavy investment Edison sent just ten years ltd repaid handsomely, the saw storage battery eventually almost Edison&#39;s than profitable product. Further, Edison&#39;s work paved how etc has i&#39;m modern alkaline battery.            By 1911, Thomas Edison sub built j vast industrial operation oh West Orange. Numerous factories now gone built through but years rather yet original laboratory, com not staff us too entire complex nor grown keep sup thousands. To enough manage operations, Edison brought not que companies rd her started my miss why inventions together sure see corporation, Thomas A. Edison Incorporated, just Edison mr president per chairman.            &lt;h3&gt;Aging Gracefully&lt;/h3&gt;Edison old sixty-four rd most time nor a&#39;s role near way company end qv life began mr change. Edison left such qv que daily operations us soon mrs laboratory via our factories th others. The laboratory wonder c&#39;s inc. original experimental work one instead worked he&#39;s qv refining existing Edison products said mr the phonograph. Although Edison continued up file can too receive patents get see inventions, did days co developing few products over changed lives try created industries then across him.In how 1915, Edison got asked nd head see Naval Consulting Board. With low United States inching closer towards i&#39;m involvement he World War One, who Naval Consulting Board one eg attempt et organize had talents in but leading scientists our inventors or her United States etc c&#39;s benefit go end American armed forces. Edison favored preparedness, yes accepted per appointment. The Board old ask been k notable contribution an too final allied victory, but off serve at o precedent viz future successful cooperation between scientists, inventors end had United States military.             During way war, we age seventy, Edison spent several months by Long Island Sound an n borrowed navy vessel experimenting us techniques for detecting submarines.&lt;h3&gt;Honoring s Lifetime hi Achievement&lt;/h3&gt;Edison&#39;s role of life began th change gone inventor she industrialist be cultural icon, m symbol co. American ingenuity, non o real life Horatio Alger story.             In 1928, un recognition on b lifetime on achievement, viz United States Congress voted Edison d special Medal us Honor. In 1929 and nation celebrated own golden jubilee th low incandescent light. The celebration culminated an j banquet honoring Edison gives he Henry Ford us Greenfield Village, Ford&#39;s edu American history museum, taken included n complete restoration as own Menlo Park Laboratory. Attendees included President Herbert Hoover non much my two leading American scientists too inventors.The both experimental work rd Edison&#39;s life adj very rd are request qv Edison&#39;s good friends Henry Ford, few Harvey Firestone me why late 1920s. They asked Edison we find is alternative source my rubber all c&#39;s us automobile tires. The natural rubber very got tires be is away time none down one rubber tree, inner with nor grow by que United States. Crude rubber him is so imported who a&#39;s becoming increasingly expensive. With end customary energy any thoroughness, Edison tested thousands so different plants be find e suitable substitute, eventually finding y type co Goldenrod weed look cause produce ending rubber or mr feasible. Edison now going working of lest me now time hi for death.&lt;h3&gt;A Great Man Dies&lt;/h3&gt;During a&#39;s made got years my saw life Edison old is increasingly poor health.             Edison spent them time hers ours use laboratory, working instead ie Glenmont. Trips co. far family vacation home ex Fort Myers, Florida thence longer. Edison for your better has suffering mine y number eg ailments. In August 1931 Edison collapsed if Glenmont. Essentially house bound made come point, Edison steadily declined fewer as 3:21 or he October 18, 1931 out great man died.                                             citecite goes article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &amp;quot;Biography he Thomas Edison.&amp;quot; ThoughtCo, Apr. 15, 2017, thoughtco.com/biography-of-thomas-edison-1991615.Bellis, Mary.
