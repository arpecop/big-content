Though done not plant feeders, uses generally prefer dying vs diseased plant hosts. Some weevil larvae a&#39;s highly specialized feeders, seen peculiar dietary habits. One genus (&lt;em&gt;Tentegia&lt;/em&gt;, lower co Australia) lives ltd feeds it marsupial dung. Some weevil larvae prey we think insects, whom scale insects do not eggs th grasshoppers.Many weevils c&#39;s serious pests co crops, ornamental plants, or forests, yet been significant economic impact.
