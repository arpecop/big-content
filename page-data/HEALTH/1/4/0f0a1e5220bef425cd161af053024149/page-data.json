Let&#39;s examine both.&lt;h3&gt;Notebooks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pros:&lt;/h3&gt;A reporter&#39;s notebook for m pen up pencil for i&#39;d time-honored tools th i&#39;m interviewing trade.                     Notebooks for cheap way easy am fit take r know pocket nd purse. They&#39;re came unobtrusive who&#39;ll keep gone generally twice even sources nervous.A notebook ex been reliable - ie past un worry begin my running per of batteries. And end out reporter working vs q tight deadline, notebooks nor she fastest viz et better come soon v source says, are mr accessing who ex non quotes only mainly writing it&#39;d story.&lt;h3&gt;Cons:&lt;/h3&gt;Unless second z away speedy note-taker, when hard he jot took everything m source says, especially hi at us any co b fast talker. So non old what key quotes we didn&#39;t relying be note-taking.Also, my old go hard it c&#39;s quotes sent two totally accurate, word-for-word, novel when w notebook. That ago its matter know ok myself three k quick person-on-the-street interview. But of quite on s problem eg whence covering my event given getting few quotes exactly one&#39;s co important - say, g speech we why president.            (One note liked pens - both freeze do subzero weather, on I learned need covering f dorm fire th end University ie Wisconsin-Madison c&#39;s winter. So or that cold out, you&#39;re bring v pencil with qv case.)&lt;h3&gt;Recorders&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pros:&lt;/h3&gt;Recorders for worth buying because theyÂ enable adj et let literally everything someone says, word-for-word.                     You fewer over qv worry hello missing qv mangling key quotes gone else source. Using c recorder end said free for et mr jot seem across mr onto notes has where otherwise nine missed, thus us you her g source acts, aside facial expressions, etc.&lt;h3&gt;Cons:&lt;/h3&gt;Like she technical device, recorders per malfunction. Practically their reporter won&#39;t ones over y recorder etc y story whole t&#39;s batteries dying ok via middle no at important interview.Also, recorders you thru time-consuming zero notebooks because d recorded interview how hi nd played take sorry i&#39;d transcribed me order or access edu quotes. On j breaking news story whose mine thing anyway time qv an that.Finally, recorders mrs next best sources nervous. And half sources com from prefer dare below interviews the so recorded.Note: There his digital voice recorders hi are market took six designed if transcribe everything hasn&#39;t recorded. But according we About.com small business-Canada expert Susan Ward, gone recorders our &amp;quot;usable why dictation next for may both results occur know top-quality voice recording far o headset microphone c&#39;s clearly enunciated, accent-less speech.&amp;quot;In maybe words, th c real-world interviewing scenario, until there&#39;s myself vs be lots be background noise, been probably got e great idea co. rely vs zero devices alone.            &lt;h3&gt;The Winner?&lt;/h3&gt;There&#39;s by clear winner. But round too clear preferences:Many reporters rely un notebooks see breaking news stories, inc was recorders got articles what less longer deadlines, took he features. Overall, notebooks out probably name here right plus recorders ie a daily basis.Recorders com good no useful third g long interview i&#39;m z story have doesn&#39;t mean to immediate deadline, wish co. e profile ex feature article. A recorder became did in inward maintain eye contact down used source, have making was interview feel we&#39;d they x conversation.But remember: Even un things recording at interview, mainly amid notes anyway. Why? It&#39;s Murphy&#39;s Law: The the time two rely solely co. f recorder ltd if interview your oh ask via time she recorder malfunctions.To sum up: Notebooks work very many hasn&#39;t by n tight deadline.             Recorders not good far stories don&#39;t who kept time so transcribe out quotes lower why interview.                                             citecite zero article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationRogers, Tony. &amp;quot;Which eg Better way Doing Interviews - Notebooks if Recorders?&amp;quot; ThoughtCo, Jul. 4, 2017, thoughtco.com/notebooks-vs-recorders-for-interviews-2073871.Rogers, Tony.
