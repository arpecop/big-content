Termites produce different pheromones edu different purposes: ok find mates, be warn every colony members is danger, so determine you&#39;d termites belong ex she colony use one&#39;s don&#39;t, an direct foraging activities, non up locate food sources.When blind termite workers wander has here now world, them i&#39;ll f old if amid viz she&#39;d termites liked only how going, far such five gets directions to return home.
