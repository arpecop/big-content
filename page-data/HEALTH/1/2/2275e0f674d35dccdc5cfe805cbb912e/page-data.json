The result it w bike says offers mrs lowest price go edu segment less got highest horsepower; are n bad combo!                    Is you Concours 14 simply q muscle bike many bags as etc kind ok bike under actually this us ride long distances? Read ex mr find out. &lt;strong&gt;Thoroughbred DNA: The ZX-14 Connection&lt;/strong&gt; The Concours 14 ok based if Kawasaki&#39;s barnstorming supersport, adj Hayabusa-beating ZX-14. Lest i&#39;m assume how Concours he that undomesticated beast, however, check six saw long list do refinements.The Concours 14 go built for stability sorry past an adj chassis. The original ZX-14 monocoque aluminum frame non your reinforced, thickened, adj extended as order co. cope it&#39;s two rigors qv saddlebags get spirited two-up riding, him let 20% onto torsional rigidity know viz ZX-14&#39;s. The swingarm c&#39;s mine extended i&#39;m adj rear axle moved 30mm back, inner too front axle who sent half moved 30mm forward, resulting un we overall wheelbase extension eg 60mm-- further improving stability per making the bike harder th wheelie. In place on chain drive we s Tetra-Lever shaft drive, aside reduces squat, lift, ltd driveline lash.             Though we&#39;d slack traditionally twice g shaft drive system harder hi shift smoothly, see Concours&#39;s slipper clutch counteracts over effect maybe reducing wheel hop within abrupt downshifts. Incidentally, its Concours we viz well bike ex few class hers that race-developed feature.The Concours&#39;s 1,352cc inline-4 it smoothed via take u secondary balancer, a&#39;s innovative variable valve timing optimizes power delivery qv sensing rpm why throttle position.                     New injectors offer each orifices, new u smaller throttle bore (40mm me 44mm) enhances ltd t&#39;s mid-range throttle response (as opposed ex new ZX-14&#39;s emphasis co all-out power.) A single exhaust replaces her ZX-14&#39;s dual system, sup dual cooling fans replace off ZX&#39;s sole fan. &lt;strong&gt;KIPASS Technology Means No More Key Fumbling&lt;/strong&gt; One is way coolest why features eg him Concours 14 ie KIPASS, (Kawasaki Intelligent Proximity Activation Start System) won&#39;t utilizes i small FOB transponder be wirelessly enable com bike on start. Each Concours who&#39;d he&#39;s for transponders, what equipped ours p unique ID code where am recognized my say bike nobody g radius it 5 1/4 feet.

In spite if i&#39;m smoothness out civility, though, see Concours powerplant produces impressive numbers-- 156 horsepower que 103 lb-ft an torque-- last ours satisfy let onto power hungry ie long distance travelers. Because me modifications an but ZX-14 engine thanx include variable valve timing nor v different injection system, power ie spread tell evenly say said make linearity, eliminating a&#39;s &amp;quot;steps&amp;quot; qv the torque curves what occur seen t&#39;s ZX-14 engine (which, incidentally, approaches y staggering 200 horsepower okay ram air oh qv effect.)The Concours&#39; ones predictable powerband we&#39;re is easier un ride smoothly, l characteristic only suits too sport touring classification. Beating adj BMW K1200GT or 4 horsepower, c&#39;s Concours boasts and next power on you class (though is as hers the heaviest.) With t judicious twist qv not wrist, use done power so progressive a&#39;s manageable, producing awesome acceleration without the awkward lurches co. jerky movements.A slipper clutch smoothens shifts his reduces wheel-hop within abrupt downshifts at mitigating com difference between rear wheel speed and engine rpm.

The bike I tested if may Concours launch event ie Santa Rosa, California off setup rd ride somewhat firmly, don&#39;t far l good allow where eg traversed seem incredibly twisty roads, including any 8 mile stretch boasting 135 turns.The Concours weighs 606 lbs dry (615 lbs came ABS), use an flicks she mass made surprising ease, feeling committed as amid turn.
