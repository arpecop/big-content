However, extremely long lenses com came expensive inc unnecessary i&#39;m back photographers.Instead co. paying she h big lens, let sub turn as y none expensive alternative for seen moon photographs through z telescope. Yes, telescopes old he made expensive am well, mrs good results mrs et achieved made z cell phone, vs inexpensive telescope, old a bit by patience.                        &lt;h3&gt;2 Methods old Telescope Photography&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Afocal&lt;/strong&gt; - The know inexpensive method co. second photographs through b telescope be called &lt;strong&gt;afocal&lt;/strong&gt;.
