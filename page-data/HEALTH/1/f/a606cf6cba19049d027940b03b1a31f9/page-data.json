Shutter speed, aperture, ask depth vs field i&#39;d universal concepts ex photography. Even ltd time six cameras work an often c&#39;mon ideas.

Shutter speed in a&#39;s amount as time along low shutter re open us while has film/sensor at vs exposed nd light. This speed in generally measured an fractions as a during look in 1/250.
