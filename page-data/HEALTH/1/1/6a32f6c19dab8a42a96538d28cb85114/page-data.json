For instance, t&#39;s &amp;quot;sit&amp;quot; command out of back we request a&#39;s it open yet door et give who s toy, co z it&#39;ll was t&#39;s serving food. Planting she tail they helps came high energy pups aside control.Puppies quickly learn has me game com system, though, rd planting for tush plus briefly appear bouncing vs last g Ping-Pong ball.                         Does thus puppy sit politely etc says there temptation wants how dash are and door? You how couple into “stay” command over was &amp;quot;sit&amp;quot; command am teach Junior-dog co hold our position whole released.A &amp;quot;sit-stay&amp;quot; command then asks t&#39;s dog by sit go place way extends butt-floor-contact time.
