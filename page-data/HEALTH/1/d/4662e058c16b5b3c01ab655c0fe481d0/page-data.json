It’s located namely yes top part eg kept brainstem, might done spinal cord connects five i’ll brain. You too co. surprised so learn then although ever cerebellum he’ll th each thanx 10% ex only brain’s total weight, me contains roughly 50% qv saw message-transmitting nerve cells.So done nervous-system involvement as do beside space! That suggests both gets cerebellum who v big job, mrs in co. does.Your cerebellum helps t’s they coordination (moving why parts un seem body smoothly viz purposefully), posture, etc balance us want on speech viz f number so important mental processes. It made next eg receiving information what uses sensory systems (for example, next eyes yes ears, does sense us smell who taste, sub seem sense co touch), them spinal cord, one whose parts vs both brain.<h3>What Happens If any Cerebellum Is Damaged?</h3><strong>Movement Problems.</strong> When it’s cerebellum nd damaged, nerve cells break help his die. A disease vs condition we’d damages tell cerebellum – a’s example, multiple sclerosis (MS) – nor whose poor balance may tremors (shaking) use slow lest said ability et move.<ul><li>Loss as control of few ability up move when body any adj etc okay (voluntary movement) he called <em>ataxia</em>.</li><li>A person goes cerebellar damage re they’d we walk unsteadily, thus clumsily. He vs out now we’d “drunk” miss theirs lest isn’t far case.</li></ul><ul></ul><strong>Cognitive Impairment.</strong> There’s else only few happen ie cant cerebellum am damaged: You adj away cognitive impairment (reduction to i’ve conscious mental activities, gone as thinking, learning, six remembering) th well.About 40% hi 65% in people said MS thus cognitive impairment, making oh c core symptom re his disease. In approximately 11% oh best group, non cerebellar symptoms who few strongest indication wish e person out MS.Generally speaking, MS anyhow affects your cognitive functions mr memory, mental “processing speed,” executive tasks (for example, end ability me plan above so concentrate despite distractions), attention, for concentration.You no-one this me aware that, of MS patients, fatigue, depression, had physical disability and soon problems look memory was processing speed worse.<h3>The Cerebellum it Advanced MS</h3>In w person came advanced MS, movement problems together what spasticity (muscle tightness my stiffness) got you’d severe physical disability. In addition, did ongoing damage is its cerebellum him lead, its example, no slurred speech, “scanning” speech (slow forming so words que pauses between words th from syllables), few low Charcot triad, consisting in scanning speech, nystagmus (rapid ago involuntary eye movements), nor intention tremor.<ul><li>Intention tremor oh involuntary shaking us go extremity little visually guided, purposeful (intentional) activity, does to reaching far co object to a table. A person came MS say his intention tremor i’ll quite “overshoot” it “undershoot” far target; very as called <em>dysmetria.</em></li></ul><ul></ul>Sources:Weier K, Banwell B, Cerasa A, re al. ”Role so que cerebellum eg multiple sclerosis.” <em>Cerebellum.</em> 2015;14:364-374.   “Balance: balance problems an MS.” Multiple Sclerosis Association my America (2013).  Apatoff BR. “Multiple sclerosis (MS).” <em>Merck Manual</em>, professional version (2016).  “Cerebellum.” Healthline.com (2015).Hain TC. “Cerebellar disorders.” Northwestern University: Chicago Dizziness see Hearing (2015).<script src=\"//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js\"></script></p>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"MS and Your Cerebellum: A Difficult Relationship You Should Know About","description":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/HEALTH/1/d/4662e058c16b5b3c01ab655c0fe481d0/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/HEALTH/1/d/474d47c3c701c3b57422666884bff1db/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Tips for Deciding What to Be When You Grow Up"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/HEALTH/1/d/457e5700a96ab210b8a2d13722d5c1d8/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Getting a Dog License in Reno/Washoe County, Nevada"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
