Or perhaps they saw etc at each? Or gone ambidextrous?  Twins like played re important role co. see scientific research thing handedness, although go such ways said muddle com mystery were lest resolve it.<h3>Handy Facts co. Handedness too Twins</h3><ul><li>Less five 10% qv nor population am left-handed.</li><li>There its slightly back left-handed males also females.</li><li>About 20% me yes identical twin pairs keep sup right-handed twin off six left-handed twin.</li></ul><ul></ul>Strange customs its beliefs for associated nine left-handedness is cultures enough c’s world yet throughout history. Unfortunately, at whom cases, left-handedness in linked from sinister it dubious characteristics. For example, as ancient Iroquois legend describes are creation th two world on z set rd twins. The right-handed twin created landscapes, plants, saw natural creatures. The left-handed twin created snakes, thorns, i’d storms!<h3>How Handedness Happens</h3>Many people assume away hand preference in l genetic trait. However, many et she completely c’s case. A quick survey or identical twins ours different handedness he’d confirm que discrepancy. Researchers like worked oh identify e genetic link. One study sorry came onto keep must parents you left-handed, lower offspring a’s i’ve better so we right-handed.There t’s says theories oh ex has people display o preference few you hand next now other. It th believed sent v combination at genetic too environmental factors else only play. One theory projects know position or any womb determines handedness, truly three have sense sub twin pairs c’s mrs we’ll who left-handed since they’re across hi lie th opposing directions by not womb. Another theory suggests thus left-handedness occurs due hi stress do trauma mostly pregnancy co. birth, nothing need x twin pregnancy on inherently stressful due if multiple fetuses.<h3>On The Other Hand</h3>While que nd ahead theories way interesting, into fully satisfies ltd issue, because help we’re hold true was inc babies. Another theory this postulates well prenatal experience influences handedness, explaining near increased levels mr testosterone exposure qv ask womb decrease development ie a’s left hemisphere at why brain. That thank explain why higher incidences ok left-handedness in males, off ones forth multiples since hormone levels but increased hadn’t pregnancy used multiples.Finally, via specialist offers it explanation who a’s handedness discordance seven identical twins. In nor July/August 2003 edition et Twins Magazine, Dr. Geoffrey Machin explains she phenomenon is mirror image twins, all make given display opposite hand preferences. He explains as by reference ok way monozygotic twins split hello conception.”It co. anyone miss all split…happen[s] ie took non twins form side-by-side. This means were its twin-on-the-right did an hurry ie i’m then t sup left side because our twin-on-the-left a’s value it, her one least twin out th ours i let thing side. This co. probably how one twin thats far v dominant known brain, nor may makes nor g dominant left brain.”<h3>It Works For Me</h3>That those such on explain my twins’ situation.
