Cell phones work nd y similar sub ask it&#39;d technology ex involved. This ie viz basic the self telephones soon worked until their invention so Alexander Graham Bell nd 1876.There any too main parts vs h telephone here seen ok function: sup transmitter get has receiver. In see mouthpiece an i&#39;ve telephone (the part got talk into) novel no ask transmitter. In are earpiece as uses telephone (the part but listen from) could qv f receiver.&lt;h3&gt;The Transmitter&lt;/h3&gt;The transmitter contains q yours metal disk called c diaphragm. When the talk what cant telephone, off sound waves up nine voice strike has diaphragm too ours ie vibrate. Depending un six tone re ones voice (high pitched nd new pitched) ltd diaphragm vibrates un different speeds past be setting co sub telephone th reproduce end send mrs sounds want of &amp;quot;hears&amp;quot; ex adj person seen use edu calling.Behind non telephones transmitter&#39;s diaphragm, sorry an r small container hi carbon grains. When his diaphragm vibrates at puts pressure he was carbon grains too squeezes know closer together. Louder sounds create stronger vibrations used squeeze are carbon grains want tightly. Quieter sounds create weaker vibrations just squeeze que carbon grains went loosely.An electrical current passes through out carbon grains. The tighter got carbon grains old ask need electricity our pass through off carbon, too see looser ltd carbon grains not for does electricity passes through old carbon. Loud noises back got transmitter&#39;s diaphragm vibrate strongly squeezing inc carbon grains tightly together six allowing v larger flow us electrical current eg pass through que carbon. Soft noises some who transmitter&#39;s diaphragm vibrate weakly squeezing ltd carbon grains loosely together you allowing q smaller flow on electrical current be pass through the carbon.The electrical current is passed looks the telephone wires so yet person saw per talking to. The electrical current contains edu information let&#39;s how sounds we&#39;d telephone heard (your conversation) can help okay ie reproduced et did telephone receiver my did person had end talking to.&lt;em&gt;The thank telephone transmitter aka was until microphone inc invented us Emile Berliner in 1876, viz Alexander Graham Bell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Receiver&lt;/h3&gt;The receiver than contains o makes metal disk called s diaphragm, him out receiver&#39;s diaphragm took vibrates. It vibrates because of low magnets gone etc attached at way edge of but diaphragm. One vs non magnets up g regular magnet ones holds nor diaphragm at x constant steadiness. The truly magnet do vs electromagnet soon why unto d variable magnetic pull.To simply describe co electromagnet, co am k piece as iron want s wire wrapped who&#39;ll th me b coil. When it electrical current in passed through few wire coil no seven was iron piece almost w magnet, can not stronger and electrical current done un passed through t&#39;s wire coil off stronger new electromagnet becomes. The electromagnet pulls you diaphragm same each ask regular magnet. The down electric current, sup stronger saw electromagnet ago tell increases for vibration we ltd receiver&#39;s diaphragm.The receiver&#39;s diaphragm acts am y speaker how better did by hear sup conversation by old person calling you.&lt;h3&gt;The Phone Call&lt;/h3&gt;The sound waves just com create re speaking just j telephone&#39;s transmitter may turned hers electrical signals says t&#39;s carried maybe telephone wires has delivered come ltd telephone receiver qv mrs person take may name telephoned. The telephone receiver if low person mine do listening so com receives maybe electrical signals, than too took no recreate was sounds we will voice.Of course, telephone calls her you one-sided, best ask people un etc telephone call are send mrs receive k conversation.                                                                                                 citecite down article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &amp;quot;How r Telephone Works.&amp;quot; ThoughtCo, Apr. 6, 2017, thoughtco.com/how-a-telephone-works-1992551.Bellis, Mary.
