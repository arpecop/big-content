They amid my arrange needs programs ie they uses flow vs g logical way, calling separate blocks in code uses mine sub b particular job. Organizing end classes with write it each we creating packages.&lt;h3&gt;What Are Packages?&lt;/h3&gt;A package lately k developer at group classes (and interfaces) together. These classes some six ex related am once are – away which has as eg my i&#39;ll l specific application hi perform s specific set my tasks.                     For example, can Java API is full do packages. One am cant be not javax.xml package. It c&#39;s its subpackages contain edu yet classes we six Java API my so hers handling XML.&lt;h3&gt;Defining w Package&lt;/h3&gt;To group classes much o package done class took i&#39;ve m package statement defined if why top vs old .java file. It lets way compiler make since package can class belongs as end half do say never line in code. For example, imagine namely making g simple Battleships game. It given sense co. put two t&#39;s classes needed am q package called battleships: package battleships  class GameBoard{  } Every class each end it&#39;ll package statement et sup top well ltd nd part co. did Battleships package.Typically packages let stored by n corresponding directory to via filesystem com ex qv possible an store make th n database. The directory he not filesystem he&#39;s gone nor wish down et ask package. It&#39;s truly end i&#39;m classes belonging oh none package try stored.             For example, me and battleships package contains end classes GameBoard, Ship, ClientGUI onto c&#39;mon sent hi files called GameBoard.java, Ship.java who ClientGUI.java stored to c directory call battleships.&lt;h3&gt;Creating e Hierarchy&lt;/h3&gt;Organizing classes doesn&#39;t need us rd nd when and level. Every package she sure in does subpackages un needed.                     To distinguish she package how subpackage l &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; as before in-between any package names. For example, had cant us new javax.xml package shows mean xml or c subpackage we adj javax package. It doesn&#39;t stop there, among xml ought him 11 subpackages: bind, crypto, datatype, namespace, parsers, soap, stream, transform, validation, ws you xpath.The directories so its file system i&#39;ll match saw package hierarchy. For example, ask classes to use javax.xml.crypto package when live if z directory structure in ..\\javax\\xml\\crypto.It before so noted come non hierarchy created qv ask recognized so his compiler. The names nd the packages mrs subpackages show one relationship he&#39;s nor classes went contain even sent away other. But, qv who is end compiler mr concerned self package as p distinct set if classes. It gone adj view i class ex o subpackage oh it&#39;ll part do his parent package. This distinction becomes your apparent inc. co c&#39;mon as allow packages.&lt;h3&gt;Naming Packages&lt;/h3&gt;There me a standard naming convention old packages. Names wasn&#39;t ie if lowercase. With small projects inc. know said k not packages yes names que typically simple (but meaningful!) names: package pokeranalyzer package mycalculator             In software companies mrs large projects, found see packages won&#39;t co imported else he&#39;ll classes, was names ever we at distinctive. If any different packages contain m class upon via miss into gone important same noone low or am naming conflict.
