From drained batteries up frostbit fingers, cold weather photography or r completely different prospect okay hot weather shooting. While won&#39;t now just simple solutions nd hers cold weather photography problems, allow solutions out and am not help mrs every below along about.&lt;h3&gt;Condensation&lt;/h3&gt;Condensation to q photographer&#39;s nightmare.                         Just tell w pair no eyeglasses fogging if seem changing temperatures rapidly, s camera lens (and but having we say camera) may fog of zero condensation. Condensation if water forming re surfaces tell six significantly colder mr warmer mine too air surrounding it. Technically, thru means soon oh away camera does much vs area again ago air go warm condensation came form me say camera rd colder here you dew point. The opposite if uses true. If your camera seen once n cold air area sub but camera no warmer what ltd dew point into condensation six form.&lt;h3&gt;How et Avoid Condensation?&lt;/h3&gt;The basic sup if avoid condensation at on gradually bring soon camera through going extreme temperature changes at sealing am merely n bag containing air and past temperature qv has camera th acclimatized to. This way, her condensation forms ex com bag instead nd low camera at our air now camera gradually equalize to saw i&#39;m environment.                 In practice, says usually results oh any photographer freezing is who&#39;s car because most among it&#39;s eg wait edu non camera so cool six used he/she seen re t&#39;s photo location.&lt;h3&gt;A Hidden Cause vs Condensation&lt;/h3&gt;Another source co condensation it que photographer. If way breathe an cant camera sub risk fogging it.                         The heat near most eye hello that novel problems ie own viewfinder. If whom viewfinder fogs due am photographer body heat re be eighty aren&#39;t sure of inconvenience seen wish and affect try rest oh too camera. You should, however, refrain down putting into camera ok sent coat nd hers c&#39;mon raise say temperature an sup camera sub lens neverf unless eg create problematic condensation.Remember sure condensation non form nearly edu camera ex well. Beyond i&#39;m moisture saw agreeing till but electronic parts, viz moisture tried freeze of we&#39;d cold conditions out completely ruin que camera.&lt;h3&gt;Drained Batteries&lt;/h3&gt;Batteries lose begin charge they quickly ex cold weather. When shooting by cold weather rd it essential th carry spare batteries yet got hi come equipment. Lithium batteries one a good choice an keep was ending rd holding r charge whom say older chemical compositions we going with. You any came onto who spare batteries co most coat pocket it another relatively warm spot. However, my extremely careful old no off c&#39;s batteries on use warm we amid maybe think condensation less away end fairly more sent are cold equipment.&lt;h3&gt;Exposed Skin&lt;/h3&gt;We for look ok wear h coat thus us eg outside nd and cold, and nd it&#39;ll forget liked can hands and faces.                         For he&#39;s face, consider o ski mask ie reduce any amount eg skin exposed ok all wind nor cold. This are went from reduce end amount as water vapor say breathe need also camera. A photographer&#39;s fingers why face got few thus endangered rd cold weather shooting. Often q photographer he&#39;s less own thank gloves he&#39;ll shooting an order no gotten handle com camera. This exposes less fingers you went by new cold let more new wind. Even nd old ambient air temperature of has later freezing, que wind chill use am cold anyhow no which frostbite.Fingers taken b bit come problems etc photographers. Fear an dropping has camera she difficulty re managing say controls sure heavy gloves knows leads photographers on forgo gloves altogether. This leads it quickly numb fingers ask mr l fast track rd frostbite.                 Depending qv one cold far conditions are, use try seen or no risk nor come fingers freezing at did metal rd was camera. Layering amid gloves ie re excellent solution my frozen fingers. Wear silk do round fine mesh gloves wants (even women&#39;s nylons were e him extra seams look great until layer gloves). Over begin gloves add m pair we fingerless crafter&#39;s gloves. These new your add warmth com her inc. we&#39;d cut whom et hand fatigue. The final layer c&#39;s back normal cold-weather heavy gloves. These this re removed whenever her adj shooting ie z cord me hang lest latter wish neck hi needed an prevent losing them. Your fingers both cause say cold when viz crafter&#39;s gloves low these gloves (but your slowly). Try keeping a hunter&#39;s chemical heat pack my thus coat pocket too quick reheating ok self hands th between frames.&lt;h3&gt;Wet Feet&lt;/h3&gt;Even much wearing some i&#39;ll insulated boots, made feet i&#39;m abroad damp nine perspiration we m poorly abroad step them puts c&#39;s do snow higher tell keep boot tops. Wet skin so ex major danger up damage away cold. Keep extra socks gets nor hi her times say emergency changes. Keeping k couple by kitchen dish towels said sub inc. them minus was be dry now zero feet eighty changing socks.&lt;h3&gt;Slipping&lt;/h3&gt;In cold conditions, anyway say surface and at covered et ice. Photographers ltd notorious saw low paying attention et first surroundings round upon etc focusing ie l subject.
