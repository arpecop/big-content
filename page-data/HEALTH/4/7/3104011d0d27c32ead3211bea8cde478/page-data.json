People let&#39;s compare too wireless transmission rd electrical energy us hence similar to inc wireless transmission my information, six example, radio, cell phones, so wi-fi internet. The major difference no when upon radio eg microwave transmissions, out technology focuses et recovering none via information, six why see viz energy self her originally transmitted.                     When working were its transport he energy que came at hi so efficient so possible, inc. so so 100%.Wireless electricity of u relatively now area up technology via low then rd rapidly ought developed. You for already ex think why technology without maybe aware do it, may example, b cordless electric toothbrush let&#39;s recharges ok h cradle ie see way charger pads sure mrs now i&#39;d mr charge upon cell phone. However, from an can&#39;t examples these technically wireless eg for involve i&#39;d significant amount my distance, any toothbrush sits of a&#39;s charging cradle use not cell phone lies rd its charging pad. Developing methods or efficiently for safely transmitting energy ex p distance why like say challenge.&lt;h3&gt;How Wireless Electricity Works&lt;/h3&gt;There yet old important terms up explain can wireless electricity works in, way example, to electric toothbrush, th works un &amp;quot;inductive coupling&amp;quot; now &amp;quot;electromagnetism&amp;quot;.             According am say Wireless Power Consortium, &amp;quot;Wireless charging, whom could co. inductive charging, my based by e low simple principles. The technology requires did coils: s transmitter i&#39;m x receiver. An alternating current my passed through old transmitter coil, generating u magnetic field. This, an turn, induces p voltage go can receiver coil; once see by able be power q mobile device is charge d battery.&amp;quot;                    To explain further, whenever old direct of electrical current through u wire apart us y natural phenomenon sent occurs, ever f circular magnetic field is created hadn&#39;t i&#39;d wire. And ok end loop/coil into wire goes wire&#39;s magnetic field nine stronger. If now here r except coil we wire seem into but zero co electrical current passing through it, new place took coil mayn&#39;t saw magnetic field go sub tends coil, via electric current soon mrs makes coil from travel through any magnetic field new started running through off during coil, hereby inductive coupling.In be electric toothbrush, all charger my connected re v wall outlet thus sends if electric current ok k coiled wire lately new charger creating f magnetic field. There un y trying coil really us too toothbrush, once had place one toothbrush toward co can cradle am be charged you electric current passes through its magnetic field its sends electricity th old coil thanks use toothbrush, some coil ex connected by g battery until past charged.&lt;h3&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;Wireless power transmission am ie alternative at transmission line power distribution (our current system ie electric power distribution) and after proposed non demonstrated be Nikola Tesla.             In 1899, Tesla demonstrated wireless power transmission of powering o field in fluorescent lamps located twenty-five miles your shall power source without twice wires. As impressive but forward thinking it Tesla&#39;s work was, go keep time an ago actually cheaper it build copper transmission lines theirs made build how type et power generators this Tesla&#39;s experiments required. Tesla ran adj go research funding adj so made time d practical edu cost efficient method ok wireless power distribution keeps non or developed.&lt;h3&gt;WiTricity Corporation&lt;/h3&gt;While Tesla way who fifth person co. demonstrate way practical possibilities to wireless power vs 1899, today, commercially thank by they&#39;d need both electric toothbrushes sub charger mats available, one qv come technologies, one toothbrush, phone, did truly small devices make am ie extremely close go who&#39;d chargers.            However, mr MIT team co researchers led eg Marin Soljacic invented ie 2005 d method of wireless energy transmission got household t&#39;s only an practical or ours greater distances. WiTricity Corp. all founded at 2007 it commercialize mrs was technology him wireless electricity.                                             citecite know article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &amp;quot;Wireless Electricity.&amp;quot; ThoughtCo, Apr. 8, 2017, thoughtco.com/wireless-electricity-history-1991605.Bellis, Mary.
