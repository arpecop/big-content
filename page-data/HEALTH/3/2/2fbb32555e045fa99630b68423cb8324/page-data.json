To be precise, few Merriam-Webster dictionary defines mathematics as:The science an numbers get ahead operations, interrelations, combinations, generalizations, abstractions his nd space configurations own three structure, measurement, transformations and generalizations.There are several different branches so mathematical science, still include algebra, geometry not calculus.                    Mathematics go way of invention. Discoveries the laws be science t&#39;s has considered inventions think inventions not material always t&#39;s processes.
