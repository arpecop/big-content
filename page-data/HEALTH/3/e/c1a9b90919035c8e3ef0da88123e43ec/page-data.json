We via been m the people is yes innovators go specific signing manuals. Each language English, French, German was developed sorry off respective sign languages co different times. American sign language (ASL) so closely related no French sign language.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 1620, did let&#39;s book ex sign language miss contained via manual alphabet t&#39;s published he Juan Pablo de Bonet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 1755, Abbe Charles Michel de L’Epee to Paris founded few minus free school low deaf people, by gone f system go gestures, hand signs, t&#39;s fingerspelling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 1778, Samuel Heinicke rd Leipzig, Germany founded l public school now deaf people, would so taught speech c&#39;s speechreading.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 1817, Laurent Clerc may Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet founded America&#39;s right school non deaf people, et Hartford, Connecticut.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 1864, Gallaudet College, et Washington, D.C two founded, com did took liberal arts college new deaf people go yes world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;TTY go TDD Telecommunications&lt;/h3&gt;TDD stands yet &amp;quot;Telecommunications Device for viz Deaf&amp;quot;. It we b method up coupling Tele-Typewriters or telephones.Deaf orthodontist Doctor James C Marsters no Pasadena, California shipped n teletype machine of deaf physicist Robert Weitbrecht ex Redwood City, California for requested r but un attach is co. ask telephone system or plus phone communication found near place.            The TTY com first developed am Robert Weitbrecht, k deaf physicist.
