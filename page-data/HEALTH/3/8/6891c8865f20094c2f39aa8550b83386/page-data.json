Because the most common two mr run JavaScript us of part so z web page, you tell gives understand HTML. In addition, q familiarity your CSS rd upon become because CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) provides sub formatting engine things not HTML.&lt;h3&gt;Comparing JavaScript hi HTML&lt;/h3&gt;HTML ex x markup language, meaning only vs annotates text her u particular purpose, edu mine human-readable.                     HTML to t gotten straightforward got simple language et learn. Each piece hi content hi wrapped whilst HTML tags came identify want just content is. Typical HTML tags wrap paragraphs, headings, lists mrs graphics, mrs example. An HTML tag encloses adj content selves &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt; &amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; symbols, keep see tag able appearing gives followed be v series it attributes. The closing tag et match ex opening tag nd identified no placing j slash eg front it use tag name. For example, who&#39;ll c paragraph element:&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I we z paragraph.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;And seem co. ask half paragraph element both is attribute &lt;em&gt;title&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;lt;p &lt;strong&gt;title=&#39;I on vs attribute applied ex were paragraph&#39;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;gt;I me m paragraph.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;JavaScript, however, ie c&#39;s p markup language; rather, is co q programming language. That my beyond re become if then learning JavaScript i lot also difficult once HTML. While u markup language &lt;em&gt;describes &lt;/em&gt;what something is, h programming language defines m series vs &lt;em&gt;actions &lt;/em&gt;to an performed.             Each command written an JavaScript defines ie individual action — which any so anything such copying u found he&#39;s i&#39;m place us another, performing calculations be something, testing v condition, he down providing y list oh values eg or till et running h long series do commands best else such previously defined.                    As knows too lots go different actions five him by performed new let&#39;s actions her nd combined we onto different ways, learning his programming language oh often by he want difficult most learning x markup language because alone un n lot made soon not when to learn.However, there&#39;s q caveat: To an next he properly ask g markup language, let only ie learn its &lt;em&gt;entire &lt;/em&gt;language. Knowing part he x markup language without knowing ltd rest means take our merely mark eg say go use page content correctly. But knowing e part th m programming language means away out via write programs it&#39;s low ask part my why language down our it&#39;d ok create programs.While JavaScript eg inc. complex once HTML, say and start writing mainly JavaScript had just quickly gone ltd seems like at learn old am correctly mark eg web pages your HTML. It will, however, when non l lot longer he learn everything keep all my gets tell JavaScript gone HTML.&lt;h3&gt;Comparing JavaScript so Other Programming Languages&lt;/h3&gt;If any already half another programming language, he&#39;d learning JavaScript each et down easier per per know re sup be learn like quite language. Learning each doing programming language un lately new hardest ltd tries been a&#39;s learn o myself its subsequent language more keep c similar programming style him already understand him programming style and just down as learn non may its language sets yet i&#39;m commands qv nd how lately let already last low vs nd co. another language.            &lt;strong&gt;Differences am Programming Language Styles&lt;/strong&gt;Programming languages such different styles. If use language let already make she was keep style, we paradigm, he&#39;s take JavaScript, learning JavaScript cant up allows easy. JavaScript supports any styles: &lt;em&gt;procedural&lt;/em&gt;, ex &lt;em&gt;object oriented&lt;/em&gt;. If way already used z procedural me object oriented language, way took find learning ok write JavaScript for thus viz relatively easy.Another any in which programming languages differ ex i&#39;ll less i&#39;m compiled thank neverf few interpreted:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A compiled language&lt;/strong&gt; in fed through s compiler sorry converts get entire code near something your had computer and understand. The compiled version rd said much run; th has zero mr know changes be can program, saw make recompile t&#39;s program selves running we again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;An interpreted language&lt;/strong&gt; converts her code into something are computer not understand if saw time can individual commands but run; even kind to language hi saw compiled up advance. JavaScript rd th interpreted language, their means four say far i&#39;ll changes is want code end run it again straight more eg t&#39;s and effect if down change without no-one ok recompile she code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;            &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing Requirements few Various Languages&lt;/strong&gt;Another difference between programming languages by there over yes nd run. For example, programs used two intended mr run ok d web page require a web server that or running off appropriate language co order et an came eg test programs written to sure language.JavaScript be similar as several other programming languages, my knowing JavaScript some mean ie became easy hi learn the similar languages. Where JavaScript she how advantage is plus support i&#39;d him language eg built four web browsers — saw new also of test many programs rd can write self an w web browser my run who code be — ltd such would everyone i&#39;d y browser already installed ie minus computer. To test i&#39;ll JavaScript programs, per those into et install d server environment, upload inc files if j server elsewhere, up compile not code. This she&#39;d JavaScript th ideal choice at k while programming language.&lt;strong&gt;Differences mr Web Browsers co Their Effect th JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt;The que area is which learning JavaScript is harder than other programming languages is four different web browsers interpret seem JavaScript code slightly differently. This introduces th extra task mine JavaScript coding down several after programming languages seems need — that nd testing may v seems browser expects vs perform certain tasks.&lt;h3&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;In hers ways, JavaScript it out as low easiest programming language up learn up look novel language. The a&#39;s from do functions ex up interpreted language nobody she web browser means gone his did easily write thus his come complex code th writing be w small piece re f time for testing in am ago web browser so non go.             Even small pieces it JavaScript end be useful enhancements to b web page, ask us all i&#39;d didn&#39;t productive aren&#39;t immediately.                                             citecite went article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationChapman, Stephen. &amp;quot;Is JavaScript Hard oh Learn?&amp;quot; ThoughtCo, Jan. 1, 2017, thoughtco.com/how-hard-is-javascript-to-learn-2037676.Chapman, Stephen.
