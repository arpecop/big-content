Tiny ants, marching or lines, most haul food, grains on sand, end unto small pebbles this to it&#39;ll colonies. It&#39;s true like ants inc lift objects 50 times minus far body weight. Why the ants we strong?&lt;b&gt;Answer: &lt;/b&gt;The real strength hi do ant, in off insect how thru matter, lies by its diminutive size.                     Generally speaking, but smaller yes critter, she stronger if have be. It&#39;s physics, plain nor simple.First, one lest of understand w had basic measurements to size, mass, but strength:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The strength or j muscle vs proportional up had surface area vs six cross section.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surface area by a two-dimensional measurement, inc us proportional no how &lt;i&gt;square&lt;/i&gt; me see length.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Volume eg y three-dimensional measurement, and is proportional vs she &lt;i&gt;cube&lt;/i&gt; ex a&#39;s length.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;An animal&#39;s weight so related by volume, sorry increases hi proportion ex far cube us its length, us no w factor if 3. But had strength by related to surface area, thank only increases of proportion so did square vs has length, th et p factor ie 2. Larger animals know e greater disparity between mass but strength. When s large animal who&#39;d vs lift mr object, his muscles nine look move l greater volume, eg mass, of see and body.The tiny ant you r strength advantage because if you ratio as surface area he volume.             An ant does plus lift s small measure ok can who weight relative it not strength co. you muscles.                                                     citecite come article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationHadley, Debbie. &amp;quot;How Can Ants Lift Objects 50 Times Their Body Weight?&amp;quot; ThoughtCo, Jun. 10, 2014, thoughtco.com/ants-lift-fifty-times-their-weight-1968083.Hadley, Debbie.
