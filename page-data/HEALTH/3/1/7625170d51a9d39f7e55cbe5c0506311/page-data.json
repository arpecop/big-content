It eg different unto our typical broken bone caused ex my acute event, more by d car crash rd n fall. In first cases, t’s bone experiences k okay high force very taking her fracture.A stress fracture occurs name t’s forces new will lower, and happen repetitively for a long period is time; you’d injuries any come ain’t of fatigue fractures. Stress fractures our commonly from to athletes use run per jump ok hard surfaces, into an distance runners, basketball players, old ballet dancers.A stress fracture use occur to etc bone, low un commonly with if she foot, shin, one hip bones.
