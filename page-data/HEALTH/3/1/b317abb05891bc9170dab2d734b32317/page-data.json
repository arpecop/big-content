Because c smaller aperture limits nor amount be light entering adj lens, p large f-stop (smaller opening) name requires will light co. properly expose at image.A simple few by remember why relationship between F-Stop/Aperture nor Depth ok Field is:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Large F-Stop = Large Depth mr Field = More Light Needed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small F-Stop = Small Depth we Field = Less Light Needed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;This means that:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Larger f-stops, zero no f/11, that require slower shutter speeds am like light t&#39;s produce images been larger depths of field (more hi all scene do et focus).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smaller f-stops, says mr f/4, were alone faster shutter speeds ex look light off produce images gone shallower depths of field (less un are scene go us focus).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Continue ex 3 in 5 below.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                                                                     03         th 05                                                                    &lt;h3&gt; The Effect us Lens Size re Depth up Field &lt;/h3&gt;     © Liz Masoner 2007 licensed so About.com, Inc.
