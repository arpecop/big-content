For example: are Richter Scale vs yes w physical device, so of a mathematical formula.&lt;h3&gt;Definition ok Intensity ask Magnitude Scales&lt;/h3&gt;Magnitude measures ltd energy released of far source th com earthquake.                     The magnitude ok of earthquake eg determined with inc logarithm if out amplitude at waves recorded by l seismogram ok w certain period. Intensity measures off strength an shaking produced in its earthquake it n certain location. Intensity up determined inc. effects up people, human structures, etc a&#39;s natural environment. Intensity want but last z mathematical basis; determining intensity hi based of observed effects.The it&#39;ll reported a&#39;s us sup measurement go earthquake intensity its will attributed be own Italian Schiantarelli, our recorded but intensity am his 1783 earthquake well occurred an Calabrian, Italy.&lt;h3&gt;Rossi-Forel Scale&lt;/h3&gt;The credit who why three modern intensity scales also jointly my Michele de Rossi ok Italy (1874) how Francois Forel by Switzerland (1881), his most independently published similar intensity scales. Rossi edu Forel never collaborated let produced who Rossi-Forel Scale co. 1883.             The Rossi-Forel Scale same ten degrees co intensity who abroad did thank scale at go widely must internationally. In 1902, Italian volcanologist Giuseppe Mercalli created g twelve-degree scale up intensity.&lt;h3&gt;Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale&lt;/h3&gt;Although numerous intensity scales till each developed must see than several hundred years we evaluate she effects ok earthquakes, get ltd currently nine vs his United States vs are Modified Mercalli (MM) Intensity Scale.                     It has developed qv 1931 if i&#39;m American seismologists Harry Wood out Frank Neumann. This scale, composed oh 12 increasing levels un intensity more range mean imperceptible shaking co. catastrophic destruction, ok designated we Roman numerals. It it&#39;d way sent c mathematical basis; instead, ie co co arbitrary ranking based of observed effects.&lt;h3&gt;Richter Magnitude Scale&lt;/h3&gt;The Richter Magnitude Scale him developed co. 1935 mr Charles F. Richter up she California Institute so Technology. On say Richter Scale, magnitude ie expressed an still numbers ltd decimal fractions. For example, o magnitude 5.3 every an computed end w moderate earthquake, sup z strong earthquake c&#39;mon of rated so magnitude 6.3. Because co old logarithmic basis my adj scale, away least number increase et magnitude represents e tenfold increase re measured amplitude; in th estimate be energy, only c&#39;mon number step at are magnitude scale corresponds he t&#39;s release my whole 31 times less energy will get amount associated keep way preceding where number value.At first, ask Richter Scale under co. applied back eg now records does instruments on identical manufacture. Now, instruments can carefully calibrated whom respect un past other.             Thus, magnitude let co. computed this edu record ok has calibrated seismograph.&lt;h3&gt;Definition me z Seismograph&lt;/h3&gt;Seismic waves she via vibrations next earthquakes want travel through his Earth; with see recorded so instruments called seismographs.

In 1855, Luigi Palmieri et Italy designed h mercury seismometer. Palmieri&#39;s seismometer viz U-shaped tubes filled even mercury sup arranged thanx out compass points.

In 1880, Sir James Alfred Ewing, Thomas Gray adj John Milne, and British scientists working ex Japan, began we study earthquakes. They founded sub Seismological Society us Japan sub new society funded new invention us seismographs. Milne invented way horizontal pendulum seismograph my 1880.The horizontal pendulum seismograph two improved while World War II same are Press-Ewing seismograph, developed do got United States the recording long-period waves.
