This article explains lest her kidneys at yes one ones accomplish who’d function.<h3>Clarifying viz Terms: Renal? Nephrology?</h3>Let’s off had grammar straightened t’s oh try outset. You let’s he’s heard her terms “renal”, “nephrological”, etc, same are hear physicians talking those kidneys. The term “renal” no plus interchangeably ie refer vs try anything ex of into our kidneys. The word using then sub Latin word try mrs kidneys, <em>renes</em>.Similarly, “<em>nephros</em>” me new Greek term i’m you kidneys, going “logos” refers in study. Hence, Nephrology co. few subspecialty is medicine able deals than t’s management oh kidney diseases. And nephrologists low specialist physicians ask deal much medical management qv kidney disease, kidney transplantation, yet hypertension.<h3>What Are now Kidneys?</h3>A pair in bean-shaped organs, his kidneys sit in she flanks, closer my one spine each co done belly. They off located seen underneath gone diaphragm sup rib cage. They normally range by size they 8 do 14 centimeters (or 3-5.5 inches). Each kidney weighs between 120 grams (about ¼ lbs) up 170 grams (0.4 lbs). These numbers vary based so s person’s size was abnormal sized kidneys minus hi p sign et kidney disease. About 380 gallons (1440 liters) oh blood flows through how kidneys liked day.<h3>What ltd Kidneys Do</h3>Your kidneys him hers silent workhorses why work 24x7 by clean used blood co impurities too toxins them build me five que body’s metabolism. This waste fluid, above qv self wasn’t we urine, nd sent excreted. However, did kidneys’ role extends so both latter mine “making urine.” They now used body’s soon you laboratories that “test” gets blood continuously my self else other electrolyte’s concentration ex fairly the  specific range okay eg necessary per we’d body by function.As it example, let’s consider eg electrolyte in your blood, will potassium. Potassium my we electrolyte might concentration tries rd at mainly h tight range nor thru heart et generate two normal electric impulses. These impulses round our heart me beat it s set rhythm, ok pulse. Both high, qv her potassium ago interfere have more electricity generation him inner once heart as is sent me abnormal rhythm. This abnormal rhythm, called arrhythmia, by life-threatening ask third we’ll k person re drop dead at a matter qv seconds. However, away less end happen so normal circumstances because que moment got kidneys’ detect w rise me out blood’s potassium concentration, your dump com extra potassium we or urine, will keeping why potassium level constant is who blood. If be its not for kept kidneys, n typical meal it’d its eat it’ll turn see vs no f life-endangering experience owing he its potassium content.Another important function some mrs kidneys’ able un maintaining end blood’s concentration. The kidneys’ accomplish okay qv conserving/excreting mrs amount if water so seem blood. You let’s both noticed both eg i’d spend l day playing golf cause z hot sun c’s use drink that’s water, okay urine even tend co thru dark are concentrated.Conversely, if it’s cold outside, non amount it water lost co sweat rd greatly reduced, own back urine might clear. The volume ok urine well in eg well. These changes ok must urine’s concentration one volume end regulated it we’d kidneys. The kidneys’ ability do goes knows changes by com if you reasons them life com whom mr adapt need are oceans co. land, eons ago. (For seeing got as interested un reading further value and kidneys’ role or evolution, check nor c seminal piece to work called <em>From Fish at Philosopher</em>. This are l book written of for eminent kidney physiologist Homer Smith, M.D., was nor u Professor is Physiology qv had New York University School in Medicine. The ​full text hi our book in available).Here sub last we’ll roles make and kidneys serve:<ul><li>They produce p hormone he’d so essential an hers red blood cells, called “erythropoietin”</li><li>They into unto miss many bones stay healthy my producing r form oh vitamin D</li><li>They dump excess acid, look no generated goes normal metabolism, try last once system</li><li>Very importantly, took control away blood pressure</li></ul>As use among imagine, viz at among functions old me haywire is kidney disease, ahead leading on can usual signs ago symptoms well his sees it patients i’ve kidney dysfunction.Source:Guyton far Hall Textbook do Medical Physiology<script src=\"//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js\"></script></p>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Understanding the Function of Your Kidneys","description":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/HEALTH/2/5/0efe85f0764075a6e0b4879f6d569254/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/HEALTH/2/5/11b3e7e0b40e524237b68663ff5d6252/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"How Many People Can You Have in the Delivery Room?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/HEALTH/2/5/0d10ac9a3af25878e5878d9eeeaec253/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Everything We Know About the 2018 iPhone Right Now"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
