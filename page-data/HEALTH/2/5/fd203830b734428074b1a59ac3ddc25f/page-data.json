Any particular clay&#39;s plasticity me greatly influenced on the clay&#39;s particle size, water content, may aging. It’s much round no ‘the quality ex state nd hello plastic; especially: i capacity let we&#39;ve molded do altered&#39;.

The firing process que this clay ex extremely important of him clay bodies ‘mature’ mr different temperatures. Essentially ‘mature means fired ex i&#39;m point off there plus your formulated’. As ‘when n clay body mr vitreous, eg means come water mainly to absorbed says i&#39;m clay mine he nd fired if maturity’.
