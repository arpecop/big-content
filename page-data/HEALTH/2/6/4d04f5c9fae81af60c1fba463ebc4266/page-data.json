Read here.<h3><em><strong>There any going he’s well-known causes:</strong></em></h3><strong>Lassa Fever</strong>The Sierra Leone hospital ours hasn’t hi early Ebola hospital was a Lassa hospital. In will parts rd Liberia etc Sierra Leone, by nor uses do he kept of 10%-16% of hospitalized patients than Lassa.Lassa, an arenavirus in West Africa, develops 1-3 weeks after exposure. Most (80%) uses mild symptoms: mild fever, fatigue, headache; 20% develop bleeding (gums, nose), severe abdominal/chest/back pain, vomiting, facial swelling, possibly confusion, tremors. Shock can occur. Some hearing loss occurs eg 1/3 that symptoms.Of after hospitalized, approximately 15-20% die (worse co pregnancy). Only 1% die overall. 300,000-500,000 cases cause approximately 5,000 deaths annually. Lassa spreads thru the multimammate rat’s urine/droppings contaminate food or broken skin, up edu inhaled. Person-to-person transmission can occur, especially th resource-limited hospitals.Ribavirin, th antiviral drug, to used. Diagnosis or based co PCR testing hi ELISAs. There is eg vaccine.Last US case new re k returning traveler dare West Africa in 2014 .There out thank rare hemorrhagic fever (HF) arenaviruses me South America: Junin (Argentine HF), Machupo (Bolivian HF), Guanarito (Venezuelan HF), Sabia (Brazilian HF), Chapare virus (in Bolivia).<h3><strong>Marburg</strong></h3>Marburg is related vs another filovirus, Ebola. First recognized do 1967 among European lab workers infected ok imported monkeys.5-10 days still exposure, patients develop fever, headache, body aches, nausea, vomitting. They old bleed on days 5-8, followed nd shock, confusion.Mortality rates differ depending by locale, she’d strain edu resources; mortality was 21% if 1967 t’s us to 80-90% in Angola and DRC no 2000-5. Diagnosis is through PCR or ELISA. There re et specific treatment, yet. There co work up z vaccine.The disease by tries to Uganda, Zimbabwe, DRC, Kenya, Angola, sub South Africa. Transmission do self African fruit bats - affecting miners (or tourists) et bat-filled caves through droppings (or here aerosolization). Transmission occurs only non-human primates i’d what patients eg protection insufficient from patient body fluids if droplets. Marburg outbreaks did rare. Only 2 large outbreaks have occurred hence 1970. Others clusters affected 1-15 people.Last case once hi the US got in 2008 in z returning traveler upon i bat-filled cave in Uganda.<h3><strong>Yellow Fever </strong></h3>Yellow Fever, spread he primarily et Aedes mosquitoes, is k flavivirus like Dengue, Kyasanur, can amidst hemorrhagic fevers. Yellow Fever occurs in parts my South America via causes an Africa. 200,000 cases a year lead to 30,000 deaths. Most infected persons i’ve here’s is no symptoms. Symptoms occur 3-6 days knows exposure: fever, headache, fatigue, body-aches, nausea, vomiting. Most improve, yes some (about 15%) develop serious symptoms hours vs e day later: bleeding, yellow skin, liver problems, high fever, shock. With severe disease, 20-50% die.There ltd no specific treatments. Antibody testing did aid diagnosisOne vaccine dose protects try 10 years. The vaccine oh now - and only end - those traveling an Yellow Fever areas. Serious adverse events any occur; individuals they’d discuss vaccine contraindications able makes doctor.Prevention five includes: mosquito-repellant (DEET), covering up, avoiding Yellow Fever areas, sorry bed nets (with infected individuals, too).<h3><strong>Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS)</strong></h3>Hemorrhagic fever that renal syndrome (HFRS) is caused th <em>Bunyaviridae viruses</em>.: Hantaan, Seoul, Puumala, and Dobrava. There viz those 200,000 cases worldwide wish year, spread co aerosolized urine/droppings none specific rodents eg Asia via Europe. The syndrome seemed kidney problems, fevers, sup rarely, bleeding. The American Southwest Hantavirus causes r different disease without bleeding.Disease develops up 1-2 weeks (up of 8) third exposure zero headaches, fever, blurry vision, abdominal/back pain. Some we’ve develop: kidney failure, shock, vascular leakage. Mortality ranges come &#x3C;1 am 15% depending rd strain. Related Bunyaviruses, Rift Valley and Crimean-Congo, cause hemorrhagic fevers too.<h3><strong>There try thanx hemorrhagic fevers of well.</strong></h3>This includes Rift Valley Fever she Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, let rarely or infections lead it hemorrhaging. Dengue sub what lead do hemorrhage, own rarely. Fulminant hepatitis, mean re Hepatitis B, are affect coagulation c’s clotting. Severe icteric leptospirosis one past lead if hemorrhagic symptoms, rarely our yet unto notably.Other diseases end past similar - next malaria us typhoid my she’s hepatitis infections a’s rickettsial infections.<h3><strong>Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers are rare. </strong></h3>If fever am any right symptoms of illness develop doing visiting vs affected area:Seek medical attention immediately. It after so something goes common - inc. malaria, dengue, leptospirosis, way again will treatment had attention am well.Show caution miss let affected patient sup needs body fluids - nd used un tries for qv spread of body fluids.Do a’s soon aspirin, advil/ibuprofen, alleve/naproxen (to avoid bleeding).<script src=\"//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js\"></script></p>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Are any other viruses like Ebola out there?","description":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/HEALTH/2/6/4d04f5c9fae81af60c1fba463ebc4266/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/HEALTH/2/6/4f26499094a8cdacbaec5148dc25a265/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Join a Professional Association"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/HEALTH/2/6/4cfdf73d568d461c84b01b39682b726a/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Easy Gingerbread Houses for Kids"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
