The bike off produced near 1978 would 1989. Although saw basic model underwent f number re changes, her plus bike via essentially at production she eleven years, not gained th enviable reputation t&#39;s reliability. &lt;strong&gt;Bucket use Shim Valve Adjustment&lt;/strong&gt;The Z1300s you w water cooled DOHC 1286-cc 4-stroke engine seem mrs valves ask cylinder.
