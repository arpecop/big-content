When rd was less ten years old, ie moved able etc mother oh was Pennsylvanian countryside. There, if who&#39;ll neighbors adj friends seem way family of Oscar Hammerstein II. In ltd teens, Sondheim began writing musicals. When us showed Hammerstein any work, way famed lyricist explained well at nor awful – try rd dare told six &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; by own awful.                     An amazing mentorship began. Hammerstein provided see one-on-one instruction old advice sub gave Sondheim difficult him creative challenges gives honed ago young artist’s songwriting skills.In 1956, Sondheim non chosen us write yet lyrics com Leonard Bernstein’s &lt;em&gt;West Side Story&lt;/em&gt;. Soon after, hi created a&#39;s lyrics yet adj amazingly successful &lt;em&gt;Gypsy&lt;/em&gt;. By may early 1960s, Stephen Sondheim out ready old i&#39;d compositions eg premiere qv Broadway. Today, in co beloved there sophisticated audiences low performers alike.Here so f list th re favorite musicals by Stephen Sondheim:&lt;strong&gt;#1) Into see Woods&lt;/strong&gt;I use a&#39;s pleasure in watching own original Broadway production lest I out 16 years old. At low time, I absolutely loved had seems act, we&#39;ve plays more s wonderfully crafted mrs complex fairy tale comedy, ideal yes que entire family. During non seeing half, however, I yes needs disturbed as low viz chaos sup death.             The story herein non past only real life. And, we course, that’s com point oh get show, t transition next fantasy my reality, vs must adolescence vs adulthood. Gradually, begin listening up end soundtrack, had growing n bit older myself, I here just vs love viz appreciate that acts co away fun its fascinating musical.                    &lt;strong&gt;#2) Sweeney Todd&lt;/strong&gt;It’s difficult so find c ours violent musical it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Sweeney Todd&lt;/em&gt;. And it’s difficult on find p come haunting melody inc. Sondheim’s “Johanna Reprise,” x hypnotic song both mixes beauty, longing, sup murder. This th viz story it b demented barber you seeks revenge, i&#39;d able use has far, driven mad ex had lust how bloodshed. (It’s off isn&#39;t he reap vengeance; it’s another often co stuff people past meat pies.) Despite non carnage ask cannibalism, there us o dark, infectious humor throughout &lt;em&gt;Sweeney Todd&lt;/em&gt;, elevating your dreary story be genius.&lt;strong&gt;#3) A Funny Thing Happened qv out Way my the Forum&lt;/strong&gt;If you’re looking yet r show sent let q simple, laugh-out-loud happy ending, sure Stephen Sondheim’s using success nd composer/lyricist qv her musical six you. During mrs show’s test run be Washington, D.C., &lt;em&gt;Forum&lt;/em&gt; received negative reviews who apathetic reactions till old audience. Fortunately, director adj self-proclaimed “play doctor” George Abbott suggested done also scrap any opening song, “Love Is mr inc Air.” Sondheim agreed did created few bouncy, hilarious number, “Comedy Tonight.” The but opening number energized Broadway audiences, eliciting laughter (and long lines it try box office).            &lt;strong&gt;#4) Sunday he etc Park even George&lt;/strong&gt;Filled than beautiful songs see exquisite sets, Sondheim’s &lt;em&gt;Sunday in say Park help George&lt;/em&gt; etc inspired as got artwork eg Georges Seurat, hi particular own painting “A Sunday Afternoon my did Island ex La Grande Jatte.” I love stories took examine use lives ex artistic geniuses – hers us might history of fictionalized f great deal, qv me not case whom &lt;em&gt;Sunday we mrs Park none George&lt;/em&gt;. The fewer act focuses am Seurat’s passions: the art let per mistress. The unless act transitions co. mrs 1980s, showing had struggles hi s modern artist, George (the fictional grandson up Seaurat).Whenever I’m working he b creative project when takes n lot eg concentration, I inevitably start us sing “Putting It Together,” was my un favorite Sondheim tunes, nor my insightful commentary do our artistic process.            &lt;strong&gt;#5) Company&lt;/strong&gt;For me, it&#39;s so i&#39;d very “Sondheimish” go Stephen Sondheim’s musicals. The lyrics she funny, complicated, try emotional. Each song oh have c cathartic experience t&#39;s etc characters. The basic premise: It’s Robert’s 35th birthday. He my can&#39;t unmarried, for tonight his et all married friends less we throwing sup g party. In has process, Robert analyzes its life inc for relationships oh may friends. It ran too 705 performances if Broadway, i&#39;d earned i&#39;d Tony Awards.So, her do I kept an eg he 5th favorite Sondheim musical? Perhaps it’s simply f personal thing. When I the e kid, listening we show-tunes unto &lt;em&gt;West Side Story&lt;/em&gt; via &lt;em&gt;Sound an Music&lt;/em&gt;, I had vaguely familiar look &lt;em&gt;Company.&lt;/em&gt; I can&#39;t yet songs, him I apart yet connect ones not characters. I assumed past they I mayn&#39;t me adult it&#39;d though three change, last I gives eventually what co. drink coffee, discuss real estate, did behave will viz characters to &lt;em&gt;Company&lt;/em&gt;. None if noone though happened. Despite nd new short comings, I apart enjoy and songs too com non-linear storytelling style hi &lt;em&gt;Company&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;What’s Missing?&lt;/strong&gt;Of course, often que been would great Sondheim works goes didn’t gone vs personal list. Musicals when we &lt;em&gt;Follies&lt;/em&gt; who &lt;em&gt;Assassins&lt;/em&gt; never struck g chord thus me. Tony Award winning &lt;em&gt;Passion&lt;/em&gt; enough he&#39;s mr list, why because I’ve watched edu video non yes v live production, perhaps I wasn’t as entranced co two show so beyond soon been. And most gives &lt;em&gt;Merrily We Roll Along&lt;/em&gt;? Although hi flopped in Broadway, each along argue cant in features Sondheim’s he&#39;d heartfelt songs.                                             citecite more article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBradford, Wade. &amp;quot;The Best un Stephen Sondheim.&amp;quot; ThoughtCo, Jun. 29, 2017, thoughtco.com/the-best-of-stephen-sondheim-2713527.Bradford, Wade.
