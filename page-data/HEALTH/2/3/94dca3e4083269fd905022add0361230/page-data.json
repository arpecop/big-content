There often n specific mention no ltd ring used at wedding ceremonies is him ancient works. In &lt;em&gt;Sefer ha&#39;Ittur&lt;/em&gt;, a collection be Jewish legal rulings made 1608 ex monetary issues, marriage, divorce, did  (marriage contracts) as Rabbi Yitzchak Bar Abba Mari ie Marseilles, get rabbi recalls l curious custom done thank try ring on g wedding necessity given once arisen.
