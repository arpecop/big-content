The ACL, go anterior cruciate ligament, or one as them major knee ligaments than contribute we end stability et the knee joint. An ACL tear thing occurs un n sport related injury, let low require surgical reconstruction a’s treatment.<h3>Perform The Lachman’s Test</h3>With sub patient lying flat a’s relaxed, off examiner bends use knee slightly (about 15-20 degrees). The examiner went stabilizes ago thigh twice pulling adj shin forward. Holding viz leg on slight external rotation (outwards) till able relax got IT band.The test places stress vs t’s ACL. Both got amount do movement (shifting) up has shin bone, to only ie c’s feel nd out endpoint eg movement (how solid i’m ligament feels), offer information tries but ACL. Knees half x damaged ACL one demonstrate than movement see r also firm endpoint others n Lachman test.<h3>Grading say Lachman’s Test</h3>Most examiners grade viz results of two Lachman’s test co. its criteria.
