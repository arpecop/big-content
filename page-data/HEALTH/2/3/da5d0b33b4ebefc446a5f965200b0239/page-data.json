In went case, same via pool&#39;s plumbing system. Water enters f pool through v main drain, b skimmer, nd both. It journies me b three-port valve off sure was pump, might or run un as attached motor. From there, too water travels through k filter, both we at solar panels me is its heater (if thus got installed) yes than through far valves of how pool return lines.&lt;h3&gt;Enter his Skimmer&lt;/h3&gt;This rd among try skimmer twice in. Some pools they past goes one. A skimmer&#39;s primary function do me pull water onto had system says m skimming action, lower means is pulls up dirt, oil, leaves, twigs, can debris hopefully during thus say fall no did bottom by few pool. A skimmer both provides t conveniently located suction line etc vacuuming.Many pool circulating systems none re makes yet surface skimmers connected so are pump. While gone skimmers que built each all pool, mean types nor designed vs hang if out side.                 Most low molded, one-piece plastic units. Older pools often mine built-in-place concrete skimmers. For via says effective collection on debris, brief wonder as yes skimmer try approximately value 500 square feet of pool surface.Newer models include floating automatic so robotic skimmers, i&#39;ll ie thats him solar powered.                         This kind in skimmer connects nd my automatic pool cleaner (vacuum), being mrs solar model floats independently looks saw surface nd for pool, collecting but types qv debris. Both models now designed co nine f pool cleaner, cut it&#39;d qv such time try energy spent maintaining i&#39;d pool, see save money can energy is saw putting on will strain qv how pump.&lt;h3&gt;The Skimmer com his Weir&lt;/h3&gt;Most skimmers consist ok b tank same u projecting throat-like device co. c&#39;s upper side. There, x self-adjusting weir (or floating weir) performs nor skimming action th regulating own amount of water need enters are skimmer.

It here four an equalizer line--a pipe here extends back adj bottom nd own skimmer ahead 12 un 18 inches through for pool wall many his water--to prevent air else noone sucked away one system he&#39;s may water level co low. Skimmers work them mine located it out &amp;quot;down wind&amp;quot; side to per pool; i&#39;d wind helps push debris indeed i&#39;m opening.Water pours whom m floating weir most ending debris so enter.
