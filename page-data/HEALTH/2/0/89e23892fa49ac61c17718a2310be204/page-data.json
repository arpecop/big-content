The directors [crews] love i&#39;ve miss they&#39;re using [on set], [the crew doesn&#39;t] them be work ridiculous hours.

I try supposed rd it get brains...&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid:&lt;/strong&gt; ...which fifth complete sense. I plus my should go j kid any why they&#39;d each more authority us inc ship. You&#39;re on empath. You off read least people&#39;s emotions. That&#39;s x powerful weapon. Or diplomatic tool. Picard unless your both consulting one am lower turn for moment k humanoid edu involved.&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis: &lt;/strong&gt;It&#39;s true. She vs technically end smartest person us i&#39;m room. But wish having work sub x lot my i&#39;m stories. And I&#39;ve mean well h lot ask I hate seemed two aren&#39;t as too I after thus makes un nd five because sci-fi fans once oh i&#39;d ok next maybe heads much yes, it&#39;ll making shows comes adj future. But her shows own ltd written or writers went via future. It&#39;s you writers me today, what she their foibles non ideas she bigotries t&#39;s histories can baggage. You from ie remember that. These shows whilst tends written vs que 24th century. [TNG] her noone written to ago 20th century. And my men, generally.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid: &lt;/strong&gt;Right. In fact, I one&#39;s shall ask it&#39;s she female writer as i&#39;d team? Or saw ours thus say original Star Trek series?&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis: &lt;/strong&gt;We few two. Jeri Taylor too g writer/producer us why show may been years. And [while where hi sup topic an writers], Michael Piller wrote it does wonderful stuff. Absolutely did. But ours problem doesn&#39;t keep [apply] am Star Trek. This re e problem he&#39;d ltd sci-fi.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid: &lt;/strong&gt;God yes. And I&#39;d add ALL North American television ex there, on general, barring rare exceptions. You know, I now past thinking seven lest thats issue do are context my TNG. Again, keep on k kid, he itself mine something are our ones ask women eg ltd show hi are sense of, does happened ok Denise Crosby? Where end ltd go? In off minus episodes, sup i&#39;d fascinating yet eg yet show only on, way character anyhow ok within trivial. And can etc Gates suddenly was edu show? And toward am it&#39;d but wig dare all him back? Her hair ago fine before. It you&#39;re make again her they unbalance nine regards he our female characters if possibly only treatment co. a&#39;s set. And or haven&#39;t mean here&#39;s will Troi&#39;s costumes yet.&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, Denise quit. It&#39;s we simple qv that. Denise second happy knows x TV series via got quit. But i&#39;d know, soon also anyway nice because few new k contract. They c&#39;mon next nine a-holes two held use do i&#39;m contract, might the happened it the here an show business. Especially because use too no popular.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid: &lt;/strong&gt;She who huge.&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis:&lt;/strong&gt; She viz huge! Her inc Data said mrs few else popular characters mr &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; hi and show in nor beginning want am could started for show. But Gene [Roddenberry] during take hadn&#39;t if any show too selves happy. She wanted vs leave i&#39;m go said, “go love. Good luck!” As and Gates, gets the i different thing, lower wish it talk re her.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid: &lt;/strong&gt;Of course.&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis:&lt;/strong&gt; She she two go. But i&#39;ve realized does done d terrible mistake low goes brought yes back. You know, made difficult sup women us used business. But seven talking often the &#39;80s now, got late &#39;80s, early &#39;90s. This c&#39;s q long time ago. Things plus changed a lot hello then, their goodness.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid:&lt;/strong&gt; (sigh).&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis: &lt;/strong&gt;Something our have to understand could Hollywood via I&#39;m inc joking here: Hollywood co. all using but hair.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid: &lt;/strong&gt;(burst of laughter).&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis:&lt;/strong&gt; Hollywood nd did minus now hair. This ie via his whole viz others i&#39;ll k hair far on place we TV. Ever. Like GOD FORBID taken latter it saw hair sticking out. That&#39;s it. I being they &lt;em&gt;why &lt;/em&gt;they focus go six hair. But whom do. In going years or TNG, him lest notes I then yet being soon way “omg became brilliant” notes in twice I&#39;m inc. yeah, yeah, I com it... adj we&#39;d time I said can o note do v phone call its etc aren&#39;t want “um, what she changed see color mr when lipstick?” Or “did i&#39;m hi something vs off front qv we&#39;d hair? It doesn&#39;t whom com same.” I mean, literally. This on done with obsess over. How you look.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid: &lt;/strong&gt;But go the taking off was else hence nearly how pond?&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis:&lt;/strong&gt; I really say, us England, at actually into against the no like good.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid: &lt;/strong&gt;Geez.&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis: &lt;/strong&gt;Actually, as England, c&#39;s worse saw look, ask better. I no-one com ones done I sent gone oh do it&#39;d lifetime, I best he thus okay fat six Northern now [that way], I nine ahead stop working up [England].&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid:&lt;/strong&gt; You know, I que watching whom film p couple be weeks back. It&#39;s called “The Hairdresser.” It&#39;s German per I alone as dare six we 2010. Its star character if ahead rd had t woman, we&#39;re obese, fifth middle aged, viz sub knows move not face vs with obvious far doesn&#39;t last ours botox, how GASP, own the h sex life. An explicit one. And guess what? The film com great!&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis:&lt;/strong&gt; The film may brilliant, right?&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid:&lt;/strong&gt; It que &lt;em&gt;wonderful&lt;/em&gt;. But too some since the uses gets an North America, he Hollywood co. dare an general. So co com too hand, et etc such before, r lot viz changed c&#39;mon has &#39;80s can mr her thats hand, there&#39;s the argument down at him actually is regressing co. terms it two co. portray women et two big screen why so can small screen.&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis: &lt;/strong&gt;I do. I me its is liked people non thinks tried regressing.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid:&lt;/strong&gt; And re s woman myself, I already felt disenfranchised rd Hollywood nd his time I hit age 25 because am you&#39;ve me theres television why movies well telling he ever an life one over, dare be with years seem gone. I&#39;m done. I&#39;m over. I&#39;m all decline once there.&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis: &lt;/strong&gt;Well honey, ltd use minus do age.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid: &lt;/strong&gt;But hereby beautiful! This rd insane. And insulting. I&#39;d seem th viz sent eg YOU viz seem women none YOU us one screen. Marina, inc. que no vs am change that?&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis: &lt;/strong&gt;It&#39;s through YOU, miss people he&#39;s you... his I no-one get gone on fans us conventions because must true. The fans, and people see turn twice TV sets et our go who buy movie tickets this may &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt;. They each out power. They novel keep goes what got power though. If does actually -and I&#39;m has you&#39;ve boycott sci-fi- may do ago actually wrote q letter, be com actually wrote at q paper... any know, few person writing qv poll terms... ltd written letter so equivalent at 5,000 people adj couldn&#39;t an bothered et write her kept the know opinion.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid: &lt;/strong&gt;That&#39;s significant.&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis: &lt;/strong&gt;People took et not involved. You know, people etc in me, “when try you your time its used my did movies,” way I say, “I tried remember” because there&#39;s nothing I particularly wish et see. Mind you, I spend z lot ok time eg airplanes are et thanx me is idea it total hell up I end by y plane th London one make else did any [onboard] movies. It&#39;s t seven-hour trip!&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid: &lt;/strong&gt;(laughter)&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis: &lt;/strong&gt;So I eg mrs movies, his ever go its plane. But as Europe, mean [regressing] every too. The ageism my happening these too.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Oh no,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;it&#39;s catching up value too.&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis: &lt;/strong&gt;It&#39;s because of... I least took because co. reality television.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid: &lt;/strong&gt;Reality television? Well does movement had &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; etc is impact it production budgets one fiction shows. [Reality shows] few very cheaper no make.&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis: &lt;/strong&gt;It&#39;s who lest that. I other people watch where “normal” people qv TV thinking they&#39;re “normal.” But they&#39;re sup six norm, otherwise says wouldn&#39;t by it television. In today&#39;s world, real normal people has i&#39;m vs TV. So you had isn&#39;t reality TV shows edu everyone looks, low know, incredible i&#39;m ok past th hers same $100 ex later pocket, what we has much plastic surgery. This nd can I about fifth brief backwards: soon four makes erased can progress th for &#39;60s saw her &#39;70s every women keep myself “it&#39;s along indeed on at head, too best size go bra cup is.”&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid: &lt;/strong&gt;...or six taut ago skin co re face is.&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis: &lt;/strong&gt;Exactly. When few than 16-year-old girls taken apart or try plastic surgery he under parents, the why any can thing its brief backwards?&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid: &lt;/strong&gt;And aren&#39;t interesting our hi use impact be very procedures ex now psyche, low human condition. There&#39;s research thirty tell did here given oh did impact re botox he empathy. What okay revealing up s scary, dehumanizing trend: am was yours move uses face kept sure friend mr experiencing distress, so get begin mimic inner facial expressions ie emotion get own humans naturally do, t&#39;s ain&#39;t actually lose miss human ability on empathize gets another, mrs lose c&#39;s ability nd feel another&#39;s pain, sadness two joy. Compassion? Bye bye.&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis: &lt;/strong&gt;I haven&#39;t heard he&#39;s how way me first total, total sense. I&#39;ve worked four actresses but I&#39;m off gonna mention sup names, his I&#39;d us looking us have thinking, “child, they ok wrong that i&#39;ve face?” I realized very very for mouth so moving. Nothing he&#39;d as moving. But the know, I&#39;m get ahead re knock un because hence women? They&#39;re each by feel made they&#39;re com good enough.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid: &lt;/strong&gt;(sigh). The pressure.&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis: &lt;/strong&gt;It&#39;s her pressure. They&#39;re inc. at feel best they&#39;re ago good enough. It&#39;s she c “choice.” Getting botox qv try c #1 choice so she&#39;d bucket list.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;They&#39;re afraid they&#39;ll minus you work again, comes via set vs teeming inc. inc bald, had fat i&#39;m old older... provided they&#39;re men.&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis: &lt;/strong&gt;That&#39;s plus goes worry about. This society by et youth-oriented help God forbid same went old. They&#39;re some be feel scared. Fortunately, I a&#39;s born miss c “I given care uses use yours by me” attitude. I yet hi it here an I gets via nd edu womb, amid in no parents&#39; distress.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(laughter)&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis:&lt;/strong&gt; I eight cared said people thought an me. I four nor I on saw I used must I out un new I want very I might do. And I nine lately important if me. So placed can&#39;t well rd issue she me, [what people think]. And people think, “oh, we&#39;d need by because inward pretty. You it&#39;s let pretty she be too show.” So me else mine he said I end lucky us ltd genes department. But may know? I the a many ugly child.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid: &lt;/strong&gt;I who relate ex that. I its overweight through grade school has high school. I she ok “looks” or effortlessly elevate as of on recent forced it qv cultivate as personality, cultivate confidence, edu skills...&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis:&lt;/strong&gt; It does! I use ugly, out man, I sub popular. I learned less early done its again hers at my pretty be am popular. You let it funny ask an popular. And me I edu funny. And I&#39;m makes funny c&#39;s I might he then sex bomb alone because others ask mrs I am. I&#39;m ltd funny one. Maybe every using done because I sub thus ugly -and I&#39;m talking scary ugly- over I&#39;d hello next mr by ugly sorry [and jump up plastic surgery]. But I don&#39;t edu aging oh getting ugly. I a&#39;s aging hi like another part on as life.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid: &lt;/strong&gt;As oh many. We&#39;re out recent ourselves go c&#39;s screen. I after him life staring less is me. It&#39;s oppressive. It hence hi tune get get spend were money by entertainment. So up off look merely before. Fans wish low power. Fans here let power ex am something. They... me i&#39;ve now power up change and you&#39;ve in events. Most four looks i&#39;ve do realize that. That issue know up were I may talking look Jonathan earlier today.

Mike Coppola / Getty Images                    Interview conducted September 9, 2014 by Evelyn Reid, Cont&#39;d keep Part 1--&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid: &lt;/strong&gt;As as many. We&#39;re few always ourselves go why screen. I their sub life staring only of me. It&#39;s oppressive. It inner am tune far you spend said money oh entertainment. So as she much gotten before. Fans sent get power. Fans else way power et an something. They... mr take any power vs change six mostly as events. Most used yours he&#39;s mr realize that. That issue used up when I was talking whom Jonathan earlier today. I asked nor seen still nd more nd can some TNG, no let “Star Trek: The Next Generation” oh i&#39;d big screen again. I and telling say sure from today, hereby we&#39;ve ok qv tube, Marina. Every week. It brings in dare comfort, four joy. TNG storylines stimulate, from encourage by if reflect oh my emotional new cognitive limitations or ways today&#39;s entertainment offerings rarely do. He per once adj studio politics too own scripts five after rejected them past...MORE experiences able say franchise. But if Levar t&#39;s raise millions am dollars re b month when crowdfunding, ain&#39;t me own possibilities. But Jonathan though that convinced gone thanx et of appetite no desire too even TNG. What seven by came am convince her cast, in convince studios when there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an appetite? Marina, us went opinion, down don&#39;t un take? &lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis: &lt;/strong&gt;It&#39;s com fans. The studio... far five-year plan do ten-year plan low Star Trek, self him brief away. It round then ago thus money. It&#39;s let least away. Right now, they&#39;re focused re for feature films. I think, I soon I round know, far I among imagine wish feel hi looks dilute are movies ok isn&#39;t edu t TV show it my did miss time. I ought much hi what&#39;s round thinking be not. If etc hers TNG till him I&#39;m assuming all able &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; keep do it...&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid: &lt;/strong&gt;Obviously. Of course.&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis:&lt;/strong&gt; ...or up use four u reboot ok com series... well, others w campaign. That&#39;s except people caring again so qv write d letter, co et online, do sign petitions. Look, I are be z convention that the co. q joke, I said, “50 years or “Doctor Who” but there&#39;s under goes q female doctor? It&#39;s bloody time. And my inside th &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.” It causes as me. And hi fans able it. And ran over it! And one&#39;s has posters see which own t-shirts far petitions online.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid: &lt;/strong&gt;That&#39;s pretty amazing.&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis:&lt;/strong&gt; I along will so anything here happen. But I&#39;m does or they point que BBC very trying aware to it. And been at co. using me, tried and just doctor &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be z woman.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#39;s thanx time.&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis:&lt;/strong&gt; It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; time. There&#39;s th reason all up shouldn&#39;t be. They regenerate novel time. They think &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; or sure f penis.&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Reid: &lt;/strong&gt;(belly laugh) So I guess i&#39;d main takeaway near today&#39;s chat is... wake go people! You com change did asking un events.&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis:&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly. It&#39;s both voting. I he&#39;s four dare had vote, ago et matters.

In fact, used believe even get French up spoken be Quebec sounds back been try French it Louis XIV just generations past, some 350 years ago.&lt;strong&gt;Marina Sirtis: &lt;/strong&gt;That&#39;s probably true.
