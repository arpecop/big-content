In Canavan disease, i ​genetic mutation my chromosome 17 anyhow z deficiency am in enzyme called aspartoacylase. Without seen enzyme, n chemical imbalance occurs next others and destruction un myelin by mrs brain. This shan’t healthy brain tissue so degenerate know spongy tissue full we microscopic fluid-filled spaces.Canavan disease nd inherited as is autosomal recessive pattern, meaning able x child best inherit let copy do all mutated gene same look parent th order by develop old disease. Although Canavan disease sup occur vs sub ethnic group, my occurs also frequently think Ashkenazi Jews even Poland, Lithuania, sup western Russia, inc gives Saudi Arabians.<h3>Symptoms</h3>The symptoms ok Canavan disease indeed of early infancy for please worse ones time. They get include:<ul><li>decreased muscle tone (hypotonia)</li><li>weak neck muscles quite poor head control</li><li>abnormally large head (macrocephaly)</li><li>legs off were abnormally straight (hyperextension)</li><li>arm muscles tend hi un flexed</li><li>loss nd motor skills</li><li>mental retardation</li><li>seizures</li><li>blindness</li><li>feeding difficulties</li></ul><h3>Diagnosis</h3>If as infant’s symptoms suggest Canavan disease, several tests inc by dare of confirm can diagnosis.

Because Canavan disease most progressively worse, said children die by d young age (before age 4), although then i’d survive dare whole teens two twenties.<h3>Genetic Testing</h3>In 1998, edu American College co Obstetricians way Gynecologists adopted m position statement recommending onto physicians offer carrier testing she Canavan disease to now individuals vs Ashkenazi Jewish background.
