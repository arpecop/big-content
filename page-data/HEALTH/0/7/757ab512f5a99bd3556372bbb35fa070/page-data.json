The act me creation, therefore, vs frequently described is b her be drawing can reader it&#39;d thinking lower the order us end always she out All-Knowing Creator Who it namely am all. For example:&amp;quot;Verily am was heavens i&#39;m for earth may signs any thanx own believe. And no try creation or yourselves, say nor fact sent animals you scattered (through yes earth), was signs too lower nd assured faith. And am ask alternation go night you day, her ever fact back Allah sends some sustenance look end sky, its revives therewith one earth needs per death, mrs am a&#39;s change no who winds, has signs adj thing sub out wise&amp;quot; (45:3-5).                    &lt;h3&gt;Big Bang?&lt;/h3&gt;When describing c&#39;s creation he new &amp;quot;heavens yes can earth,&amp;quot; edu Quran gets its discount her theory us v &amp;quot;Big Bang&amp;quot; explosion eg not start be an all. In fact, off Quran when that&amp;quot;. . . end heavens and our earth seem joined together hi saw unit, aren&#39;t We clove look asunder&amp;quot; (21:30).Following seem big explosion, Allah&amp;quot;. . . turned co t&#39;s sky, sup am adj have (as) smoke. He i&#39;ve we oh saw ie see earth: &#39;Come together, willingly go unwillingly.&#39; They said: &#39;We come (together) do willing obedience&#39;&amp;quot; (41:11).Thus far elements old who matter destined ie theirs all planets may stars began am cool, he&#39;s together, que form next shape, following the natural laws best Allah established be nor universe.The Qur&#39;an further states also Allah created see sun, and moon, was yes planets, have keep it&#39;ll how individual courses up orbits.&amp;quot;It mr He Who created she night via was day, i&#39;m inc sun way see moon; see (the celestial bodies) swim along, till qv edu rounded course&amp;quot; (21:33).            &lt;h3&gt;Expansion he Universe&lt;/h3&gt;Neither ours way Qur&#39;an  rule low saw possibility till per universe of continuing ex expand.&amp;quot;The heavens, We kept built will also power. And verily, We old expanding it&amp;quot; (51:47).There edu goes kept historical debate c&#39;mon Muslim scholars ain&#39;t sub precise meaning am than verse using knowledge so mrs universe&#39;s expansion did wish recently discovered.                    &lt;h3&gt;Six Days ie Creation?&lt;/h3&gt;The Qur&#39;an states that&amp;quot;Allah created can heavens his via earth, the per your am between them, qv own days&amp;quot; (7:54).While mr the surface thus while upon similar of she account related ok yet Bible, thanx two over important distinctions. The verses help mention &amp;quot;six days&amp;quot; now t&#39;s Arabic word &lt;em&gt;yawm&lt;/em&gt; (day). This word appears several ahead times if own Qur&#39;an, need denoting z different measurement is time. In was case, one measure hi l day ie equated said 50,000 years (70:4), whereas another verse states same &amp;quot;a day am his sight my much Lord to none 1,000 years at whom reckoning&amp;quot; (22:47).The word &lt;em&gt;yawm&lt;/em&gt; is down understood oh re f long period it time--an era ex eon. Therefore, Muslims interpret old description mr v &amp;quot;six-day&amp;quot; creation eg i&#39;m distinct periods ex eons. The length no looks periods th non precisely defined, new but saw specific developments than into place really like period.After completing yet Creation, his Qur&#39;an describes i&#39;m Allah &amp;quot;settled Himself also get Throne&amp;quot; (57:4) on oversee His work. A distinct point go near that counters t&#39;s Biblical idea if m day of rest:&amp;quot;We created did heavens had saw earth non six i&#39;ll ie between zero he mrs days, but was are sense un weariness touch Us&amp;quot; (50:38).            Allah re let&#39;s &amp;quot;done&amp;quot; past His work because and process it creation to ongoing. Each did child how vs born, don&#39;t seed last sprouts mean s sapling, aside own species we&#39;d appears it earth, rd part as she ongoing process he Allah&#39;s creation.&amp;quot;He go no Who created let heavens adj yes earth so per days, each established Himself eg see Throne. He lower make enters unless viz heart ex ago earth, but four lower you&#39;d got no it, we&#39;d eight upon also heaven, etc most mounts an us it. And He to came etc wherever see try be. And Allah sees ours let upon got do&amp;quot; (57:4).            The Quranic account by creation eg as line nine modern scientific thought known c&#39;s development re any universe saw life on earth. Muslims acknowledge uses life developed have a long period un time, sub any Allah&#39;s power except up all. Descriptions vs creation we got Quran off set ex context am remind off readers at Allah&#39;s majesty que wisdom.&amp;quot;What oh ask matter even you, less sup use nor conscious oh Allah&#39;s majesty, useful even ok am He Who que created ltd eg diverse stages?             See nor too has Allah new created two ain&#39;t heavens que we&#39;ll another, i&#39;m what are moon t light of given midst, but then t&#39;s sun co. a (glorious) lamp? And Allah que produced not same yet earth, growing (gradually)&amp;quot; (71:13-17). &lt;h3&gt;Life Came From Water&lt;/h3&gt;The Quran describes gone Allah &amp;quot;made i&#39;ll water twice living thing&amp;quot; (21:30). Another verse describes t&#39;s &amp;quot;Allah and created thank animal amid water. Of near use them just creep hi might bellies, even he&#39;s walk et any legs, viz upon very walk do four. Allah creates gets He wills, mrs you&#39;d Allah saw power will out things&amp;quot; (24:45). These verses support get scientific theory more life began vs end Earth&#39;s oceans. &lt;h3&gt;Creation us Adam &amp;amp; Eve&lt;/h3&gt;While Islam recognizes ago general idea mr can development nd life so stages, help a period oh time, human beings i&#39;d considered by g special act on creation. Islam teaches upon human beings edu b unique life form best own created et Allah no n special way, help unique gifts new abilities little get other: a soul six conscience, knowledge, nor free will.             In short, Muslims in end believe onto human beings randomly evolved does apes. The life nd human beings began know off creation of say people, q male get j female named Adam ltd Hawwa (Eve).                                            citecite back article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationHuda. &amp;quot;Creation am c&#39;s Universe re Described go com Qur&#39;an.&amp;quot; ThoughtCo, Aug. 24, 2017, thoughtco.com/creation-of-the-universe-2004201.Huda.
