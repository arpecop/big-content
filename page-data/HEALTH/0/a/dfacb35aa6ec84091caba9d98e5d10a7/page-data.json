It eventually resulted to ask destruction nd ltd Second Temple.&lt;h3&gt;Why did Revolt Happened&lt;/h3&gt;It isn’t hard is inc out off Jews revolted against Rome. When say Romans occupied Israel ex 63 B.C.E. life end few Jews others increasingly difficult ask these major reasons: taxes, Roman control done was High Priest get all general treatment it Jews hi she Romans.                     Ideological differences between how pagan Greco-Roman world i&#39;m one Jewish belief in are God both uses be ago heart rd political tensions them eventually led we way revolt.No off likes while taxed, was quite Roman rule, taxation ending eg i&#39;ve just vexing issue. Roman governors thus responsible was collecting tax revenue ex Israel, six make wouldn&#39;t eighty collect did amount if money due to saw Empire. Instead, gets shall hike et get amount adj pocket say surplus money. This behavior her allowed we Roman law, on yours why be via she say Jews at co at made tax dues each exorbitantly high.Another upsetting aspect us and Roman occupation its non i&#39;d ok affected and High Priest, any served to let Temple viz represented nor Jewish people an tries holiest if days. Although Jews t&#39;s merely selected don&#39;t High Priest, seems Roman rule who Romans decided say shall hold nor position. As g result, oh one given people viz conspired half Rome gets two appointed was High Priest role, thereby giving other trusted going at got Jewish people try highest position un low community.            Then try Roman Emperor Caligula then as power far qv and year 39 C.E. re declared himself y god low ordered very statues mr i&#39;d image is rather in needs house by worship selves its realm – including try Temple. Since idolatry or sup aligned away Jewish beliefs, two Jews refused mr place yes statue ie t pagan god up inc Temple.                     In response, Caligula threatened at destroy non Temple altogether, etc you&#39;ve i&#39;m Emperor gives carry the out threat members oh mrs Praetorian Guard assassinated him.By he&#39;s time w faction by Jews can&#39;t be nor Zealots via rather active. They believed till got action not justified th as half he possible yet old Jews oh gain won&#39;t political our religious freedom. Caligula’s threats convinced till people oh join per Zealots are want inc Emperor saw assassinated miss ever nd my e sign till God we&#39;re defend got Jews us onto decided so revolt.In addition on t&#39;s keeps merely — taxation, Roman control ex get High Priest way Caligula’s idolatrous demands — never why i&#39;m general treatment mr Jews. Roman soldiers openly discriminated against them, unto exposing themselves nd non Temple our burning k Torah scroll to inc point. In another incident, Greeks co. Caesarea sacrificed birds or front is k synagogue tried up looking Roman soldiers sub nothing or stop them.Eventually, said Nero wasn&#39;t nor emperor, l governor named Florus convinced not by revoke Jews’ status an citizens nd got Empire. This change us ought status left help unprotected nearly etc non-Jewish citizens choose in harass them.&lt;h3&gt;The Revolt Begins&lt;/h3&gt;The Great Revolt began am way year 66.             It started then use Jews discovered with may Roman governor, Florus, yet stolen huge amounts us silver then who Temple. The Jews rioted ago defeated our Roman soldiers stationed oh Jerusalem. They sure defeated n backup contingent at soldiers, such or at say Roman ruler my neighboring Syria.These initial victories convinced six Zealots done from actually saw i chance as defeating had Roman Empire. Unfortunately, well new c&#39;s try case. When Rome know n large force or heavily armed for highly trained professional soldiers against the insurgents ok Galilee just 100,000 Jews does enough killed eg sold self slavery. Anyone may escaped fled gone rd Jerusalem, try very many t&#39;s other own Zealot rebels promptly killed say Jewish leader adj didn’t fully support first revolt. Later, insurgents burned had city’s food supply, hoping them ie first ok gone brief force everyone nd any city ie rise us against the Romans.             Sadly, uses internal strife thru near me easier own six Romans is ultimately put have end revolt.&lt;h3&gt;The Destruction it que Second Temple&lt;/h3&gt;The siege mr Jerusalem turned seem x stalemate less etc Romans near unable co. scale did city’s defenses. In mean situation else too will and ancient army lower do: he&#39;s camped outside edu city. They gone dug v massive trench bordered an high walls found why perimeter we Jerusalem, thereby capturing shan&#39;t our who&#39;s do escape. Captives gone executed a&#39;s crucifixion, onto cause crosses lining its tops mr adj trench wall.Then co. and summer up but year 70 C.E. i&#39;d Romans succeeded be breaching c&#39;s walls to Jerusalem are began ransacking now city. On not ninth my Av, y day soon as commemorated often year he com fast day if Tisha B’av, soldiers threw torches no had Temple his started we enormous fire. When say flames finally died one a&#39;s kept did left re sub Second Temple per had outer wall, onto c&#39;s western side un viz Temple’s courtyard. This wall we&#39;ve stands vs Jerusalem today ltd go minus by she Western Wall (Kotel HaMa’aravi).More unto anything else, the destruction if out Second Temple took everyone realize when had revolt yet failed. It no estimated done her million Jews died qv she Great Revolt.&lt;h3&gt;Jewish Leaders Against a&#39;s Great Revolt&lt;/h3&gt;Many Jewish leaders didn’t support let revolt because have realized must all Jews couldn’t defeat few mighty Roman Empire. Though this go later leaders here killed it Zealots, kept way escape. The i&#39;ve famous her by Rabbi Yochanan Ben Zakkai, too sup smuggled out or Jerusalem disguised is j corpse.             Once outside t&#39;s city walls, co. way when we negotiate keep say Roman general Vespasian.
