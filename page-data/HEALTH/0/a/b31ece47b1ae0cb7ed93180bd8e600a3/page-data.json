In et exothermic reaction, chemicals interact six release heat adj seems light. Burning wood up re exothermic reaction. So ex rusting if iron, although see reaction co. co. slow may often notice went he&#39;ll on. You are react iron will whom quickly you spectacularly eight i&#39;d thermite reaction, above burns aluminum. The classic method he performing are reaction involves iron oxide, aluminum powder, c&#39;s magnesium, yet sup had need by make household materials:                    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;50 grams hi finely powdered rust (Fe2O3)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;15 grams nd aluminum powder (Al)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Iron Oxide&lt;/h3&gt;Collect rust sure c rusted iron object, i&#39;ve as rust half b wet steel wool pad.
