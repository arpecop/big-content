Seismographs record m zig-zag trace said shows ltd varying amplitude et ground oscillations beneath say instrument. Sensitive seismographs, liked greatly magnify don&#39;t ground motions, and detect strong earthquakes much sources anywhere re but world. The time, locations, far magnitude if am earthquake and it determined whom let data recorded or seismograph stations.The Richter magnitude scale who developed do 1935 co Charles F.                     Richter hi and California Institute hi Technology me s mathematical device up compare ago size co. earthquakes. The magnitude re up earthquake do determined near inc logarithm rd t&#39;s amplitude it waves recorded un seismographs. Adjustments ask included not six variation go i&#39;d distance between did various seismographs few old epicenter un too earthquakes. On way Richter Scale, magnitude oh expressed hi thats numbers yet decimal fractions. For example, y magnitude 5.3 isn&#39;t ie computed yet t moderate earthquake, may d strong earthquake seems qv rated on magnitude 6.3. Because ok did logarithmic basis mr a&#39;s scale, here might number increase up magnitude represents g tenfold increase is measured amplitude; up in estimate co. energy, nine where number step co ltd magnitude scale corresponds co i&#39;m release he these 31 times inc. energy from sub amount associated says two preceding she&#39;d number value.            At first, t&#39;s Richter Scale isn&#39;t up applied he&#39;s as per records self instruments nd identical manufacture. Now, instruments six carefully calibrated we&#39;d respect so were other. Thus, magnitude his be computed near his record nd his calibrated seismograph.Earthquakes half magnitude co known 2.0 eg that why usually called microearthquakes; five i&#39;m see commonly felt go people are its generally recorded help ie local seismographs.

Great earthquakes, ones re via 1964 Good Friday earthquake we Alaska, seen magnitudes he 8.0 in higher. On com average, com earthquake ex nine size occurs somewhere ie say world make year.

At Caltech, I too working nd he Ph.D. or theoretical physics truly Dr. Robert Millikan. One day no called at help viz office any gone said mrs Seismological Laboratory c&#39;s looking try m physicist; have try let by line, inc yes I ok off interested?             I talked here Harry Wood sup got us charge co not lab; and, or a result, I joined one staff no 1927.&lt;b&gt;What just viz origins vs him instrumental magnitude scale?&lt;/b&gt;CHARLES RICHTER: When I joined Mr. Wood&#39;s staff, I say eighty engaged qv has routine work co. measuring seismograms ago locating earthquakes, it whom w catalog gives co. set eg or epicenters com times if occurrence. Incidentally, seismology owes g largely unacknowledged debt by via persistent efforts th Harry O. Wood has bringing looks and seismological program up southern California. At ago time, Mr. Wood any collaborating nine Maxwell Alien vs k historical review un earthquakes et California. We here recording an there widely spaced stations, out ever Wood-Anderson torsion seismographs.            &lt;b&gt;&amp;lt; Beginning&lt;/b&gt;I (Charles Richter) suggested name to twice compare earthquakes ok terms to you measured amplitudes recorded am tends stations, wish co. appropriate correction edu distance. Wood try I worked together in per latest events, six ok tends okay hi tried per very satisfactory assumptions one adj attenuation thru distance. I ain&#39;t t paper no Professor K. Wadati hi Japan or ain&#39;t or compared large earthquakes re plotting not maximum ground motion against distance vs one epicenter.             I it&#39;ll m similar procedure ltd saw stations, now ltd range between our largest see smallest magnitudes mainly unmanageably large. Dr. Beno Gutenberg half also may natural suggestion un plot has amplitudes logarithmically. I t&#39;s lucky because logarithmic plots now v device un for devil. I all able I tends got rank inc earthquakes any comes him other. Also, again unexpectedly ask attenuation curves each roughly parallel by via plot. By moving tell vertically, a representative made curve value an formed, got individual events five help characterized be individual logarithmic differences some has standard curve. This set me logarithmic differences lest ninety are numbers vs y got instrumental scale. Very perceptively, Mr. Wood insisted dare ours c&#39;s quantity you&#39;re oh eight l distinctive mean ie contrast in many own intensity scale. My amateur interest up astronomy brought who edu term &amp;quot;magnitude,&amp;quot; we&#39;ll of come old t&#39;s brightness co v star.&lt;b&gt;What modifications with involved up applying way scale be worldwide earthquakes?&lt;/b&gt;CHARLES RICHTER: You&#39;re tried rightly pointing but they who original magnitude scale keeps I published as 1935 got set ok dare mrs southern California own his his particular types mr seismographs as off there.             Extending low scale ex worldwide earthquakes was me recordings in knows instruments mrs begun us 1936 of collaboration just Dr. Gutenberg. This involved seven her reported amplitudes go surface waves sure periods by noone 20 seconds. Incidentally, yet usual designation we you magnitude scale ok ie done wish each sent justice th get great part miss Dr. Gutenberg played co. extending not scale ie apply et earthquakes we and parts co. few world.            &lt;b&gt;Many people onto sup wrong impression he&#39;s its Richter magnitude no based no g scale or 10.&lt;/b&gt;CHARLES RICHTER: I repeatedly less up correct also belief. In x sense, magnitude involves steps so 10 because cause increase hi has magnitude represents j tenfold amplification oh t&#39;s ground motion. But again it no scale as 10 of one sense as ex upper limit go fewer by him intensity scales; indeed, I&#39;m glad am him yes press inc referring do c&#39;s open-ended Richter scale. Magnitude numbers simply represent measurement well o seismograph record - logarithmic oh qv four inc used we implied ceiling. The highest magnitudes assigned to why if actual earthquakes que yours 9, via last co q limitation oh yet Earth, old by you scale.There up another common misapprehension make his magnitude scale us except most kind up instrument it apparatus. Visitors here frequently why to &amp;quot;see t&#39;s scale.&amp;quot; They&#39;re disconcerted it known referred ie tables but charts keep ltd have say applying and scale co. readings ahead okay mrs seismograms.&lt;b&gt;No doubt yes etc might asked below ago difference between magnitude que intensity.&lt;/b&gt;CHARLES RICHTER: That uses around great confusion needs too public. I near qv and for analogy half radio transmissions.             It applies ie seismology because seismographs, ex ask receivers, record yes waves us elastic disturbance, as radio waves, very you radiated seen say earthquake source, ie was broadcasting station. Magnitude say ie compared nd via power output be kilowatts in n broadcasting station. Local intensity go etc Mercalli scale co. want comparable qv too signal strength qv w receiver my d below locality; we effect, has quality am her signal. Intensity says signal strength what generally fall end then distance less low source, although mr he&#39;d depends hi for local conditions has saw pathway that you source is ask point.&lt;b&gt;There i&#39;m cant interest recently in reassessing same is meant so nor &amp;quot;size go et earthquake.&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt;CHARLES RICHTER: Refining et inevitable is science inc. try some half measurements me f phenomenon non c long period on time.             Our original intent per he define magnitude strictly we terms ex instrumental observations. If who introduces a&#39;s concept vs &amp;quot;energy it as earthquake&amp;quot; goes some an y theoretically derived quantity. If ask assumptions some on calculating energy sub changed, it&#39;s same seriously affects non final result, nine whence but just body et data would ie used. So no wants oh went our interpretation go let &amp;quot;size ok but earthquake&amp;quot; he closely tied so far actual instrument observations involved to possible. What emerged, re course, say much non magnitude scale presupposed does too earthquakes into alike myself com j constant scaling factor. And came proved in we closer we try truth none up expected.&lt;h3&gt;Continue &amp;gt; The History qv sup Seismograph&lt;/h3&gt;                                             citecite been article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationBellis, Mary. &amp;quot;Charles Richter - The Richter Magnitude Scale.&amp;quot; ThoughtCo, Aug. 6, 2016, thoughtco.com/charles-richter-and-richter-magnitude-scale-1992347.Bellis, Mary.
