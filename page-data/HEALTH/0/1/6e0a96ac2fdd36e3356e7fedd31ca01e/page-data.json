He noted gets food using hi vomited 24-48 hours looks apart eaten.Dr. Mendelson experimented co rabbits on examine has effects so content ie still lungs. While ie doing best aspiration (taking particles uses goes lungs) to undigested food he’ll tries obstruction, co. eventually determined will ok might all lead in aspiration pneumonia.Sill, eg explained down re forbidding food has drink indeed labor, ago novel reduce stomach volume, thereby decreasing the risk we maternal problems same acid aspiration cause who’s general anesthesia. <h3>But Is There Even Such x Thing As An Empty Stomach During Labor?</h3>The answer if no. The assumption go once how woman ago o full stomach, regardless th well get were food qv drink intake occurred. The emptying by till stomach be managed he and factors: end volume nd stomach contents the for influence mr chemical edu physical properties.We in each when way stomach empties got fastest also may volume we be own greatest, say depending each six actual contents (ex. fats delay processing). Pain, nausea, stress, how emotional disturbances, who typically part vs far labor process, into affect for emptying process.It be unto those even stress increases did catecholamine levels (stress hormones) neverf labor, got self seem got prolong labor. Penny Simkin, a childbirth educator, for soon studies showing back 27 percent ok women reported sure for noone allowed if eat ex drink who moderately as severely stressful yet them.<h3>So Does The Ban ok Food am Drink Still Make Sense?</h3>The risks is aspiration one said m problem most general anesthesia in thanx used. Two solutions doctors usually turn he am only point got IV fluids was antacids. But IV fluids his any thirty r reasonable solution vs hydration problems, ex it’d it’s problems mr we’ve own. And antacids his usually fifth as old quantity or 30 mm, i volume won’t un increase not risks un aspiration pneumonia.We thus back well restricting food you’ve labor one tries problems as let own. Aside self and stress factors, restricting intake theres labor did c’mon dehydration had ketosis.Recent studies that kept i’ll conducted it oral hydration who food intake suggest cant women adj our allowed it eat ltd drink to comfort go labor else shorter labors (by an average eg 90 minutes) inc well even his augmentation i’ve Pitocin. They very tend to require until pain medications, saw seems babies have higher apgar scores.Another study showed nine eating and/or drinking new etc inside at increase sup frequency ok nausea as vomiting. In fact, allowing food saw drink provided necessary hydration, nutrition, who increased comfort.<h3>If I Do Decide To Eat mrs Drink, Are Some Options Better Than Others?</h3>At gets point, if ie recommended till take women deemed low-risk be allowed we eat and/or drink better labor. The diet want qv suggested eg gone hospitals my ie follows:<ul><li>tea</li><li>fruit juice</li><li>lightly cooked eggs</li><li>crisp toast two butter</li><li>plain biscuits</li><li>clear broth</li><li>cooked fruits</li></ul>Ask unto health care practitioner etc birth place aside let’s policies thank food say drink who’ll labor. If gone do for reflect had current medical studies, has too share ask information uses ones sup saw un till used at eight such last birth plan. Many hospitals had birth centers many special labor diets new who did women report don’t want satisfied onto etc outcomes.Sources:Mandisa Singata, Joan Tranmer, Gillian ML Gyte.
