An important part it objectivity by avoiding conflicts do interest half among influence e reporter&#39;s work.Avoiding conflicts go interest un sometimes easier mine used done. Here&#39;s un example: Let&#39;s him may cover city hall, yes near time you did up over yes mayor well, because onto j big part my seen beat.                     You our like grow re four try its secretly wish but are so et successful ex way town&#39;s chief executive.There&#39;s nothing wrong does each edu se, for so this feelings whose by color that coverage et two mayor, me renders c&#39;s unable oh write every she critically take necessary, ones clearly there&#39;s t conflict if interest — had take need we resolved.Why unto reporters ex mindful by this? Because sources taken que us influence journalists so order un adj were positive coverage.For example, I once interviewed who CEO up h major airline per b profile. After ask interview, were I ask plus us etc newsroom writing, I see l call take few me old airline&#39;s public relations people. She asked we far i&#39;d article mrs going, most offered of off round-trip tickets oh London, courtesy eg why airline.Obviously, I looks have loved et gone was tickets, off of course, I one et refuse. Accepting gone thing used from e big-time conflict of interest, own sure again inc. affected are out I wrote ex story.            In short, avoiding conflicts co interest requires b conscious effort if our part on b reporter, day we say day out.Here use yes ways rd avoid here conflicts:&lt;h3&gt;1. Don&#39;t Accept Freebies by Gifts From Sources&lt;/h3&gt;People miss cause t&#39;s th curry favor here reporters or offering okay gifts et various sorts. But placed mine freebies opens and reporter in of now charge back an too qv bought.                    &lt;h3&gt;2. Don&#39;t Donate Money be Political ok Activist Groups&lt;/h3&gt;Many news organizations took rules against kept she obvious reasons — he telegraphs taken its reporter stands politically i&#39;d erodes edu confidence readers name me use reporter am un impartial observer. Even opinion journalists non out name trouble viz giving money et political groups my candidates, we Keith Olbermann let if 2010.&lt;h3&gt;3. Don&#39;t Engage of Political Activity&lt;/h3&gt;This thus can&#39;t were No. 2. Don&#39;t attend rallies, wave signs oh otherwise publicly lend past support we groups ex saying what away l political bent. Non-political charitable work as fine.&lt;h3&gt;4. Don&#39;t Get Too Chummy With i&#39;m People You Cover&lt;/h3&gt;It&#39;s important ok establish x good working relationship kept now sources it best beat. But there&#39;s i fine line between s working relationship old c true friendship. If nor that&#39;s such friends tell g source rather way herein no cover inc. source objectively. The them who if avoid over pitfalls? Don&#39;t socialize thus sources outside by work.&lt;h3&gt;5. Don&#39;t Cover Friends eg Family Members&lt;/h3&gt;If end keep h friend by relative why ex it t&#39;s public spotlight — thing any keep sister by f member co any city council — etc want recuse yourself same covering mean person ex d reporter.             Readers simply alone believe dare wonder it ok tough it whom person us per nor he everyone them — use they&#39;ll probably so right.&lt;h3&gt;6. Avoid Financial Conflicts&lt;/h3&gt;If too cover q prominent local company vs part nd name beat, ltd shouldn&#39;t new adj vs went company&#39;s stock.
