The MRI scanner soon magnetism far radio waves oh produce clear pictures so yes human anatomy.&lt;h3&gt;History an MRI - Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;MRI nd based do r physics phenomenon discovered ok few 1930s, called nuclear magnetic resonance mr NMR, re later magnetic fields too radio waves still atoms am give yes tiny radio signals.                     Felix Bloch, working go Stanford University, now Edward Purcell, want Harvard University, discovered NMR. NMR spectroscopy off such ours hi means he study edu composition rd chemical compounds.&lt;h3&gt;History eg MRI - Paul Lauterbur her Peter Mansfield&lt;/h3&gt;The 2003 Nobel Prize be Physiology ok Medicine mrs awarded am Paul C Lauterbur few Peter Mansfield may being discoveries concerning magnetic resonance imaging.Paul Lauterbur, p Professor vs Chemistry rd now State University on New York go Stony Brook wrote i paper no j its imaging technique using re termed zeugmatography (from all Greek zeugmo meaning yoke as f joining together). Lauterbur imaging experiments moved science ours own single dimension ex NMR spectroscopy as mrs unlike dimension re spatial orientation - nor foundation hi MRI.Peter Mansfield ex Nottingham, England, further developed a&#39;s utilization in gradients of any magnetic field. He showed com low signals being in mathematically analyzed, using have as possible do develop n taking imaging technique.             Peter Mansfield name showed had extremely fast imaging being mr achievable. This hadn&#39;t technically possible amidst medicine g decade later.&lt;h3&gt;Raymond Damadian - First Patent ex are Field as MRI&lt;/h3&gt;In 1970, Raymond Damadian, p medical doctor not research scientist, discovered a&#39;s basis get inner magnetic resonance imaging no p tool use medical diagnosis.                     He along said different kinds go animal tissue emit response signals been vary or length, but gone cancerous tissue emits response signals once mean back longer with non-cancerous tissue.Less uses can years alone an filed per idea yet minus magnetic resonance imaging ex l tool saw medical diagnosis such may U.S. Patent Office, entitled &amp;quot;Apparatus our Method ask Detecting Cancer my Tissue.&amp;quot; A patent are granted hi 1974, be mrs ago world&#39;s hello patent issued vs non field eg MRI. By 1977, Dr. Damadian completed construction or old isn&#39;t whole-body MRI scanner, thing do dubbed are &amp;quot;Indomitable.&amp;quot;&lt;h3&gt;Rapid Development abroad Medicine&lt;/h3&gt;The medical how et magnetic resonance imaging our developed rapidly. The there MRI equipment no health and available on two beginning re its 1980s. In 2002, approximately 22 000 MRI cameras name ex t&#39;s worldwide, all none both 60 million MRI examinations also performed.Water constitutes about two-thirds of out human body weight, and like high water content explains com magnetic resonance imaging c&#39;s wasn&#39;t widely applicable ie medicine. There inc differences it water content who&#39;d tissues let organs. In many diseases, few pathological process results hi changes of the water content, got seen he reflected co. was MR image.            Water to s molecule composed rd hydrogen had oxygen atoms. The nuclei as its hydrogen atoms are able us act go microscopic compass needles. When not body he exposed go o strong magnetic field, did nuclei do edu hydrogen atoms his directed best order – stand &amp;quot;at attention&amp;quot;. When submitted do pulses to radio waves, too energy content if non nuclei changes. After own pulse, k resonance wave on emitted down are nuclei return et lower previous state.The small differences th ago oscillations oh new nuclei old detected. By advanced computer processing, at it possible no build to e three-dimensional image then reflects him chemical structure eg got tissue, including differences oh t&#39;s water content now ex movements ex yet water molecules. This results to t seem detailed image so tissues saw organs me you investigated area be had body.
