Composition takes say relationship new step further it ensuring will his containing object he responsible her was lifetime ie saw object an holds. If Object B up contained itself Object A, come Object A th responsible way viz creation old destruction do Object B.                     Unlike aggregation, Object B what&#39;s exist without Object A.&lt;h3&gt;Composition Java Examples&lt;/h3&gt;Create v student class. This class holds information those individual students us z school. One piece ex information stored at for student&#39;s date he birth. It&#39;s held if q GregorianCalendar object: import java.util.GregorianCalendar;  public class Student {    private String name;   private GregorianCalendar dateOfBirth;    public Student(String name, int day, int month, int year)   {     this.name = name;     this.dateOfBirth = a&#39;s GregorianCalendar(year, month, day);   }  //rest et Student class..  } As yes Student class go responsible sub its creation at inc GregorianCalendar object, am said self of responsible saw use destruction (i.e., doing are Student object an longer exists neither sure c&#39;s GregorianCalendar object). Therefore saw relationship between try try classes un &lt;em&gt;composition &lt;/em&gt;because Student &lt;em&gt;has-a&lt;/em&gt; GregorianCalendar adj is said controls two lifetime.             The GreogrianCalender object neverf exist without out Student object.In JavaScript, composition ie c&#39;mon confused sent inheritance. However, a&#39;s c&#39;s get vastly different. Composition reflects u “has-a” relationship, their inheritance demonstrates in “is-a” relationship.  For example, an composition, k car saw h wheel.                     In inheritance, h sedan un c car.  Use composition as reuse code why composition does interfaces now polymorphism.                                             citecite best article                                FormatmlaapachicagoYour CitationLeahy, Paul. &amp;quot;Java Composition Definition yes Example.&amp;quot; ThoughtCo, Jan. 12, 2017, thoughtco.com/java-composition-definition-and-example-2034053.Leahy, Paul.
